The defendant is to reside at a Residential Reentry Center (RRC), preferably the Lawrence CAC, for a period
of 90 days, or until such time as a suitable residence is located and approved by the Probation Office.

CAUSE

Mr. Thomas was released on 8/20/10, without the benefit of residing at an RRC prior to his release. Mr. Thomas has
proposed two residences, both of which have been found to be inappropriate based upon the fact that they are either
federally subsidized or Section 8, and his previous convictions make him a prohibited occupant. In view of this, the
Probation O'ff`ice recommended, and Mr. Thomas has agreed, to reside at an RRC for 90 days, or until such time as he is
able to locate a suitable residence, approved by the Probation Office.

Your Honor will find Probation Form 49 executed by Mr. 'l"homas and agreeing to the amendment to his conditions ol`
Supervised Release. IfYour Honor concurs with our position, please al`fix your signature below.
