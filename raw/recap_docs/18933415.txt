                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                         DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                   Criminal No. 07-cr-150-01-SM

William Swanson


                                  O R D E R

     On February 16, 2010, defendant appeared for a probable

cause hearing under Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.1 on one alleged

violation of conditions of supervision.           Defendant stipulated to

probable cause on the violation.

     Defendant sought bail conditions under Rule 32.1(a)(6).

Under Rule 32.1(a)(6) defendant bears the burden of establishing

by clear and convincing evidence that he will not flee and that

he poses no danger to any other person or to the community.

Here, he was in control of a vehicle which reeked of marijuana

smoke.     The locked glove compartment revealed 100 Oxycontin

pills, $4,930 in U.S. currency, and photos of defendant with kids

and women.     He is a drug dealer and, although he is not a risk of

flight, he is a danger to the community.           There are no conditions

which are likely to assure his presence and the safety of the

community.

     Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the defendant be detained

pending trial.

      The defendant is committed to the custody of the Attorney

General or his designated representative for confinement in a

corrections facility separate, to the extent practicable, from

persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody

pending appeal.     The defendant shall be afforded a reasonable

opportunity for private consultation with defense counsel.             On

order of a court of the United States or on request of an

attorney for the government, the person in charge of the

corrections facility shall deliver the defendant to the United

States Marshal for the purpose of an appearance in connection

with a court proceeding.

      SO ORDERED.
