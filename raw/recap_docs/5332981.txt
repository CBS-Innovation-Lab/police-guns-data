                             UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                              DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS

Criminal No. 13-10111-DJC

                                UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

                                                    v.

                                       HARRY PARSONS

               ORDER ON GOVERNMENT’S MOTION FOR DETENTION

Boal, M.J.

       The defendant, Harry Parsons, is charged in an indictment with conspiracy to distribute

heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846 and distribution of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. §

841(a)(1). An initial appearance was held on April 22, 2013, at which time the government

moved for detention pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 3142 (f)(1)(B) (defendant is charged with an

offense for which the maximum sentence is life), (f)(1)(C) (defendant is charged with an offense

for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed in the “Controlled

Substances Act”), and (f)(2)(A) (risk of flight).

       The court held a detention hearing on June 3, 2013.1 The government called one witness,

DEA Agent Carl Rideout, and introduced four exhibits into evidence. The Court adjourned the

hearing until June 4, 2013 for completion of the Pretrial Services Report, at which time the

parties presented oral argument. The Court considered the evidence submitted at the hearing, the

parties’ arguments, and also a Pretrial Services Report that recommended release to an in-patient

drug treatment program.


       1
          The detention hearing was originally scheduled for May 2, 2013. At the defendant’s
request, the detention hearing was postponed twice.

I.     FACTS

       The government alleges that Parsons and co-defendants Francisco Monteiro and Manuel

Lopes conspired to distribute heroin from at least March 2012 until March 1, 2013 in New

Bedford, Massachusetts. The government also alleges that on or about February 15, 2013,

Parsons facilitated a transaction at his home whereby a cooperating witness purchased 97 grams

of heroin from an unknown male.

II.    ANALYSIS

       A.      Legal Standard

       Under the Bail Reform Act, a defendant may only be detained pending trial if the

Government establishes either by clear and convincing evidence that the person poses “a danger

to the safety of any other person or the community if released,” or by a preponderance of the

evidence that the person poses a serious risk of flight. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f); United States v.

Patriarca, 948 F.2d 789, 791-793 (1st Cir. 1991). If there is some risk, the Court should consider

whether a combination of release conditions “will serve as a reasonable guard.” Id. at

791.

       In determining whether suitable release conditions exist, the judicial officer must take

into account the following: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense charged; (2) the

weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and characteristics of the accused,

including family ties, employment and other factors; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the

danger posed by the person’s release. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g). Each of these factors must be

weighed, and the decision on whether to release is an individualized one. Patriarca, 948 F.2d at

794.


                                                 2

       The Government bears the burden of persuasion to establish that no condition or

combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and

the safety of any other person and the community. United States v. Dillon, 938 F.2d 1412, 1416

(1st Cir. 1991). Where, as here, there is probable cause to believe that the defendant committed

a controlled substance offense with a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more, a

“rebuttable presumption” of danger and flight arises. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e). The presumption

imposes a burden of production on the defendant to come forward with “some evidence” to

demonstrate that he is not a danger to the community or a flight risk. United States v. Jessup,

757 F.2d 378, 384 (1st Cir. 1985), abrogated on other grounds by United States v. O’Brien, 895

F.2d 810 (1st Cir. 1990). Without credible evidence to rebut the presumption, the presumption

alone may justify detention. United States v. Alatishe, 768 F.2d 364, 371 (D.C.Cir. 1985).

Notwithstanding this rebuttable presumption, the burden of persuasion always remains with the

Government. Jessup, 757 F.2d at 381.

       B.      Defendant’s History And Characteristics

       Parsons is 26 years old. He was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts and is life-long

resident of Massachusetts.

       Parsons is married and has a child, age 1, with his wife. He also has a child, age 5, from

a former relationship. He lives with his wife and children. Parsons’ mother and father live in

Massachusetts. He also has a brother, who lives with their mother.

       Parsons reported that from approximately age 15 until the time of his arrest he was

working for a roofing company “under the table.”

       Parsons has a substance abuse problem. Parsons’ criminal history includes a conviction


                                                3
             Case 1:13-cr-10111-DJC Document 55 Filed 06/06/13 Page 4 of 5



for a drug trafficking offense. He was on pretrial release for state drug charges (marijuana) at

the time of his arrest in this case.

        C.      Nature Of The Offense; Weight Of The Evidence

        The government alleges that Parsons was involved in a conspiracy to distribute heroin

and that he facilitated the sale of approximately 97 grams of heroin on or around February 15,

2013. The evidence against him appears strong.

        D.      Risk Of Flight

        Parsons appears to have strong ties to the community. Despite being aware that he was

likely to be indicted in this case, he did not flee the District. However, he does have a history of

defaults and he was arrested for the instant offense while on pretrial release.

        E.      Dangerousness

        Parsons does not appear to have a history of violence, other than an assault and battery

case when he was a juvenile, approximately 9 years ago.

        F.      Proposed Conditions Of Release And Assessment Of All Factors

        Although Parsons has a history of defaults and was arrested for this offense while on

pretrial release for state drug charges, he has significant ties to the community and does not

appear to have a history of violence. It does appear that he has a significant substance abuse

problem and, in the opinion of Pretrial Services, is in serious need for drug treatment, which he

has never had before and desires. Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the defendant be released to

an inpatient substance abuse treatment facility, but be DETAINED pending the availability of

such a program. Pretrial Services shall inform the court when a suitable inpatient substance

abuse facility becomes available, at which time the court will hold a release hearing. At that

time, the court will hear from the parties regarding the other conditions of release proposed by

Pretrial Services and any other conditions that the parties would like the court to consider.
