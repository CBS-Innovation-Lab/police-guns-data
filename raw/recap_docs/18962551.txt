        The assented to motion to reschedule jury trial (document no.

14 ) filed by the government is granted; Trial is continued to the

two-week period beginning February 15, 2011, 09:30.              Continuance

limited to 60 days in the interest of justice so that the defendant

can undergo a mental evaluation.

        Defendant shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights within 10

days.    The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting

a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv), for the

reasons set forth in the motion.

        SO ORDERED.
