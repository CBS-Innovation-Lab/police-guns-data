                     UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                   FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

   v.                                        Criminal No. 14-cr-104-LM
                                             Opinion 2015 DNH 023
Roger Perkins and
Windyann Plunkett


                                 O R D E R


       Defendants Roger Perkins and Windyann Plunkett were

indicted on a charge of conspiracy to possess with intent to

distribute controlled substances, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§

846 and 841(b)(1)(B)(iii).       Perkins also faces charges of being

a felon in possession of a firearm, and possessing a firearm in

furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18

U.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1)(A) and 922(g)(1), respectively.

       The charges stem from the execution of a search warrant at

Perkins’s apartment in Laconia, New Hampshire on March 25, 2014.

Perkins and Plunkett have now moved to suppress the contents of

a safe that was discovered during the execution of the search

warrant, and opened at the Laconia Police Station the following

day.    The court held a hearing on this matter on February 12,

2015.   For the reasons that follow, the Defendants’ motion to

suppress is denied.

                          Factual Background

    On March 24, 2014, Detective Christopher Noyes of the

Laconia Police Department filed an application for a warrant to

search Perkins, his vehicle, and his apartment, located at 23

Gale Avenue in Laconia.     Detective Noyes’s warrant application

was accompanied by a detailed affidavit chronicling an

investigation into Perkins’s drug dealing activities.          The

application sought permission to search for and seize items

including crack cocaine, cocaine, drug paraphernalia, and

profits from drug transactions.

    A judge of the New Hampshire Circuit Court approved the

warrant application, and it was executed the following day, on

March 25, 2014.   Officers waited outside of Perkins’s apartment,

and conducted a vehicle stop when he returned home.          Perkins was

arrested when officers discovered crack, cocaine, mushrooms, and

MDMA inside of his car.

    Officers then conducted a search of Perkins’s apartment.

Plunkett, who is Perkins’s girlfriend, was the only person at

home at the time of the search.      In plain view, officers

discovered marijuana, mushrooms, and two firearms.          Officers

also observed a locked Sentry safe.

    By this time, Perkins had been transported to the Laconia

Police Station, then to the Belknap County Jail.         Detective

Noyes placed a telephone call to a different Laconia police

officer who had transported Perkins to the County Jail, and

asked if Perkins would divulge the code to access the safe.

Perkins responded that he would not.

    The following day, March 26, 2014, Detective Noyes began

processing the evidence that had been seized during the

execution of the search warrant.        Detective Noyes recalled that

he had discovered some paperwork associated with the safe, which

included a factory-issued access code.       Using this code,

Detective Noyes was able to gain access to the safe.          Inside, he

found further quantities of crack and cocaine, as well as cash

and two additional firearms.

    Perkins moved to suppress the items discovered inside of

the safe, contending that the act of opening and searching the

safe exceeded the scope of the warrant in violation of the

Fourth Amendment.    Plunkett subsequently filed an assented-to

motion to join Perkins’s motion to suppress, which the court

granted.


                               Discussion

    The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution

provides that no warrant shall issue, “but upon probable cause,

supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing

the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be


                                    3
         Case 1:14-cr-00104-LM Document 29 Filed 02/17/15 Page 4 of 6



seized.”    U.S. Const. amend. IV; see also United States v.

Lyons, 740 F.3d 702, 724 (1st Cir. 2014).          There are limits,

however, to the extent of the required particularity of the

description.     “A lawful search of fixed premises generally

extends to the entire area in which the object of the search may

be found . . . . Thus, a warrant that authorizes an officer to

search a home for illegal weapons also provides authority to

open closets, chests, drawers, and containers in which the

weapon might be found.”       United States v. Ross, 456 U.S. 798,

820-21 (1982).

    “As a general proposition, any container situated within

residential premises which are the subject of a validly-issued

warrant may be searched if it is reasonable to believe that the

container could conceal items of the kind portrayed in the

warrant.”    United States v. Gray, 814 F.2d 49, 51 (1st Cir.

1987).    This is true whether the container is locked or

unlocked.    United States v. Towne, 705 F. Supp. 2d 125, 134 (D.

Mass. 2010); see also United States v. Wright, 704 F.2d 420,

422-23 (8th Cir. 1983) (per curiam) (search of a locked safe

permissible where the drugs described in the warrant “obviously

could fit within the safe and reasonably could be expected to be

found in it”); United States v. Morris, 647 F.2d 568, 573 (5th

Cir. 1981) (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks



                                      4

omitted) (reasoning that suppressing evidence found inside of a

locked jewelry box at the subject premises would require “either

[] an additional search warrant [] for each container within a

larger container, or that the agent seeking the warrant possess

extrasensory perception so that he could describe, prior to

entering the house, the specific boxes, . . . etc. that he

anticipated searching”).

    Detective Noyes’s warrant application particularly

described both the targets of the search, and the contraband

that he expected might be discovered.       Detective Noyes sought

permission to search Perkins, his vehicle, and his apartment

located at 23 Gale Avenue.     Detective Noyes’s highly detailed

warrant application also set forth the items that he expected to

find, including crack, cocaine, and other drugs, as well as

packaging materials, drug paraphernalia, and drug proceeds.

    A safe is precisely the type of container that would

reasonably be expected to contain contraband in these

circumstances.   Once officers executed the warrant and

discovered the locked safe, they were under no additional

obligation to secure a separate warrant to open it.          See Ross,

456 U.S. at 821 (“When a legitimate search is under way, and

when its purpose and its limits have been precisely defined,

nice distinctions between closets, drawers, and containers . . .



                                    5

must give way to the interest in the prompt and efficient

completion of the task at hand.”).          Thus, Detective Noyes’s

opening of the safe and his seizure of its contents did not

violate the Fourth Amendment.1


                                  Conclusion

      For the foregoing reasons, Defendants’ motion to suppress

(doc. no. 18) is DENIED.2


      SO ORDERED.

      1At oral argument, Defendants relied heavily on Riley v.
California, 134 S. Ct. 2473 (2014), and United States v. Wurie,
728 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2013), for the proposition that Perkins had
a heightened expectation of privacy in the locked safe. The
court views these cases as wholly inapposite, as they involve
the factually distinguishable circumstance of a warrantless
search of a cellphone incident to arrest.

      2Separately, Perkins moved to suppress a post-arrest
statement that he made regarding the contents of the locked safe
(doc. no. 19). Pursuant to the Government’s agreement not to
introduce this statement in its case-in-chief, this motion is
denied as moot.
