                      ORDER ON SUCCESSIVE § 2255 PETITION

        In compliance with an order from the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit

that allowed the petitioner to proceed with his successive § 2255 petition in light of

Johnson v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015), the Court follows district precedent

and rejects his claim that his prior convictions under Maine’s burglary statute are

not violent felonies for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). However,

the Court accepts his claim that under Johnson, his prior convictions under Maine’s

robbery statute are no longer proper ACCA predicates. With this ruling, the Court

concludes that the provisions of the ACCA should not be applied to the Defendant,

and the Court orders his resentencing.

I.      Background1

        A.      Verdict, Sentence, and Direct Appeals




1       In setting forth the salient facts, the Court has significantly abridged Mr. McCurdy’s litigation
history, which is remarkably extensive, to reflect only those facts relevant to the motion currently
before the Court.
      On December 31, 2008, a federal jury convicted Mark McCurdy of being a felon

in possession of a firearm. Jury Verdict (ECF No. 148). In anticipation of sentencing,

the Probation Office listed the following predicate convictions for Armed Career

Criminal Act (ACCA) status:

      (1) Two counts of burglary on April 14, 1984 in Washington County Superior

          Court for the state of Maine, Docket No. CR-83-173; and

      (2) Two counts of robbery on June 1, 1984 in Penobscot County Superior Court

          for the state of Maine, Docket No. CR-83-247.

Presentence Investigation Report ¶¶ 31–32. Had Mr. McCurdy not been convicted of

other crimes, his criminal history category would have been IV due to his ACCA

status under United States Sentencing Guideline § 4B1.4(c)(3); however, due to his

other convictions, his criminal history category was calculated at V. Id. ¶¶ 38–39

(citing U.S.S.G. § 4B1.4(c)(1)). Because of his ACCA status, his offense level was fixed

at 33. Id. ¶ 24. As Mr. McCurdy went to trial, he was not accorded acceptance of

responsibility, and his Guideline sentence range was 210 to 262 months. Id. ¶ 59.

On July 20, 2009, the Court sentenced Mr. McCurdy to 210 months of incarceration—

at the low end of the guideline range—three years of supervised release, and a $100

special assessment. Minute Entry (ECF No. 191); Tr. of Proceedings, Sentencing

Proceedings (ECF No. 208); J. (ECF No. 195).

      On July 31, 2010, Mr. McCurdy appealed to the Court of Appeals for the First

Circuit. Notice of Appeal (ECF No. 197). On November 16, 2010, the First Circuit

affirmed, United States v. McCurdy, No. 09-2101 (1st Cir. Nov. 16, 2010), and on



                                           2
March 21, 2011, the Supreme Court denied Mr. McCurdy’s petition for a writ of

certiorari. McCurdy v. United States, 562 U.S. 1301 (2011) (mem.).

      B.     First and Second Habeas Petitions

      On August 4, 2011, Mr. McCurdy filed his first § 2255 petition. Mot. Under §

2255 to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sent. by a Person in Fed. Custody (ECF No. 240).

In that petition, Mr. McCurdy raised a number of issues, including allegations of

ineffective assistance of counsel and prosecutorial misconduct. On September 27,

2013, the Court denied the petition. Order on Def.’s First and Second Mots. for Leave

to File Suppl. Pleadings and on Def.’s Mot. Under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 to Vacate, Set

Aside or Correct Sent. (ECF No. 305). Mr. McCurdy appealed that decision to the

First Circuit Court of Appeals. Notice of Appeal (ECF No. 307). On June 4, 2014, the

First Circuit denied his request for a certificate of appealability and terminated his

appeal. J. (ECF No. 314).

      On July 6, 2015, Mr. McCurdy filed his second § 2255 petition, alleging that

the Government misstated facts in its brief to the Court of Appeals and that the

Government and the Court blocked Mr. McCurdy’s repeated attempts to secure the

source of the misinformation. Mot. to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct a Sent. by a Person

in Fed. Custody (28 U.S.C. § 2255) (ECF No. 351). On July 28, 2015, the Magistrate

Judge issued a recommended decision in which he recommended that this Court

dismiss without prejudice Mr. McCurdy’s July 6, 2015 motion, dismiss or deny all

other pending motions, and deny a certificate of appealability.         Recommended

Decision on 28 U.S.C. § 2255 Mot., Mot. for Relief from J., Mot. for Findings of Fact,



                                          3
Mot. for Counsel and Disc. Mots. (ECF No. 352). Mr. McCurdy objected to the

recommended decision on August 28, 2015.              Pet’r’s Objs. to Magistrate’s

Recommended Decision on 28 U.S.C. § 2255 Mot. (ECF No. 356). On March 24, 2016,

this Court affirmed the recommended decision, dismissed without prejudice Mr.

McCurdy’s July 6, 2015 motion, denied and dismissed the remaining pending

motions, and denied any certificate of appealability.          Order Affirming the

Recommended Decision of the Magistrate Judge (ECF No. 366). On April 28, 2016,

Mr. McCurdy appealed this Court’s March 24, 2016 order. Notice of Appeal (ECF No.

369). On October 11, 2016, the First Circuit Court of Appeals denied Mr. McCurdy’s

request for a certificate of appealability, his motion for appointment of counsel, and

his motion for leave to file a successive motion. J. (ECF No. 393). On December 5,

2016, the Court of Appeals’ mandate was filed in this Court. Mandate (ECF No. 394).

      C.     Application to File Successive § 2255 Motion and Successive §
             2255 Motion to Vacate Sentence

      On November 25, 2015, Mr. McCurdy filed an application for leave to file a

successive motion to vacate his sentence on the ground that his prior Maine burglary

conviction no longer qualified as a violent felony under either the enumerated or

residual clauses of the ACCA in light of Johnson v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2551

(2015) (Johnson II). App. for Leave to File a Second or Successive Mot. to Vacate, Set

Aside, or Correct Sent. 28 U.S.C. § 2255 by a Prisoner in Fed. Custody (ECF No. 378)

(Leave App.). On June 21, 2016, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit granted

Mr. McCurdy’s application seeking leave to file a second or successive § 2255 motion

on the ground that Mr. McCurdy had made a prima facie showing that his challenge,

                                          4
pursuant to Johnson II, to his armed-career-criminal designation legitimately relied

upon a “new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review

by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.” J. at 1 (quoting 28 U.S.C.

§ 2255(h)(2)) (ECF No. 376). The First Circuit transferred Mr. McCurdy’s leave

application materials to this Court with instructions to file them as a § 2255 motion.

Id.2

       On June 27, 2016, the Magistrate Judge appointed David R. Beneman, the

Federal Defender for the District of Maine, to represent Mr. McCurdy in his motion,

Order Appointing Counsel (ECF No. 382), and ordered the Government to answer Mr.

McCurdy’s motion. Order to Answer (ECF No. 383). The Government answered Mr.

McCurdy’s motion on September 7, 2016. Mot. for Summ. Dismissal of Mot. to Vacate,

Set Aside, or Correct Sent. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (ECF NO. 391) (Gov’t’s

Opp’n). On October 3, 2016, Mr. McCurdy filed a reply. Def.’s Reply to Gov’t’s Opp’n

to Mot. to Correct Sent. Under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (ECF No. 392) (Def.’s Reply).

II.    THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES

       A.      Mark McCurdy’s § 2255 Motion

       In his November 25, 2015 leave application—which the Court construes as a §

2255 motion in accordance with the First Circuit’s instructions—Mr. McCurdy




2       On June 27, 2016, Mr. McCurdy additionally filed a formal § 2255 motion, raising the same
issues that he previously raised in his leave application to the First Circuit. See Mot. Under 28 U.S.C.
§ 2255 to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sent. by a Person in Fed. Custody (ECF No. 380). In accordance
with the First Circuit’s instructions, however, the Court regards Mr. McCurdy’s November 25, 2015
leave application as the operative § 2255 motion.

                                                   5
contests the validity of the ACCA enhancement following Johnson II.                   A

memorandum accompanying his leave application explains:

      The Supreme Court decision in [Johnson II] rendered the State of Maine
      offense of Class C Burglary (17-A M.R.S.A. § 401(1)(A)) not a violent
      felony for purpose of a sentence enhancement under either the
      enumerated clause or the residual clause of the [ACCA] because it
      lacked an essential element required for generic burglary.

Leave App. at 8.

      B.     The Government’s Response

      In its September 7, 2016 opposition, the Government first argues that because

Mr. McCurdy’s criminal record included two Maine convictions for a “generic

burglary,” he properly qualified for ACCA status under United States v. Duquette,

778 F.3d 314, 317–19 (1st Cir. 2015). Gov’t’s Opp’n at 6. The Government notes that

in Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575 (1990), the Supreme Court defined “generic

burglary” for purposes of the ACCA to be “any crime, regardless of its exact definition

or label, having the basic elements of unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or

remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.” Id. at 8 (quoting

Taylor, 495 U.S. at 599). The Government turns to the First Circuit’s 2015 Duquette

decision in which the First Circuit wrote that the Maine burglary statute, 17-A M.R.S.

§ 401(1), “contains all the elements of ‘generic burglary’” that the Supreme Court

identified in Taylor. Id. at 9 (quoting Duquette, 778 F.3d at 318). Even though the

Sentencing Guideline defined “crime of violence” to include only burglary of a

dwelling, the Government states that the First Circuit concluded that “the term

‘burglary’ as used in the ACCA [is] broad enough to include both residential and non-



                                           6
residential offenses.” Id. (quoting Duquette, 778 F.3d at 318 (quoting United States

v. Giggey, 551 F.3d 27, 35–36 (1st Cir. 2008) (en banc)). The Government maintains

that Duquette is still good law and that this Court is bound to apply it until it is

overruled by the First Circuit Court of Appeals. Id. at 10.

      The Government distinguishes the United States Supreme Court case of

Mathis v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2243, 2248–49 (2016), from Mr. McCurdy’s case.

Id. at 11. The Government observes that in Mathis, the Government had conceded

the Iowa burglary statute covered a broader range of conduct than “generic burglary”

does. Id. (citing Mathis. 136 S. Ct. at 2248–49). The Iowa burglary statute reached

“any building, structure, [or] land, water, or air vehicle.” Id. (quoting Mathis, at

2248–49 (quoting Iowa Code § 702.12 (2013)) (emphasis in original). The Government

notes that the Maine statute defines burglary as entering or surreptitiously

remaining in a “structure” knowing the person is not licensed or privileged to do so,

“with the intent to commit a crime therein.”       Id. (quoting 17-A M.R.S. § 401).

Referring to Maine’s statutory definitions of “structure” and “dwelling place,” the

Government argues that “Maine’s definition of burglary is…more consistent than is

Iowa’s with the American Law Institute’s Model Penal Code § 22.1 (1980), on which

the Supreme Court based its definition of ‘generic burglary.’” Id.

      Neither is the Government impressed with the contention that Maine’s

definition of “structure” to include a vehicle or conveyance being used as a dwelling

makes a difference. Pointing to a Fifth Circuit case, United States v. Herrold, 813

F.3d 595 (5th Cir. 2016), the Government argues that the Fifth Circuit recently



                                          7
rejected “a remarkably similar claim.” Id. at 13. Furthermore, the Government

points out that Maine courts have interpreted this statutory language to include only

places where people live, such as house trailers, mobile homes, and inhabitable camp

trailers. Id. at 13–14 (citing State v. Albert, 426 A.2d 1370, 1374 (Me. 1981), State v.

Lerman, 302 A.2d 572, 576–77 (Me. 1993), State v. Cookson, 293 A.2d 780, 784–85

(Me. 1973), State v. Cook, 1 A.3d 333, 337 (Me. 2010)).

       After counting the two burglaries as ACCA predicates, the Government notes

that the ACCA requires at least three predicate convictions, and it contends that

either of Mr. McCurdy’s two robberies qualifies as an ACCA predicate. Id. at 14–16.

The Government maintains that these convictions qualify under the ACCA’s “force

clause.” Id. Further, referring to the Shepard-approved3 documents it attached to

its opposition, the Government contends that Mr. McCurdy was charged in both

robberies with being armed with a dangerous weapon, which it argues would satisfy

the “force clause” even if the offense was overbroad and did not otherwise qualify as

a “violent felony.” Id. at 16–17 (citing United States v. Whindleton, 797 F.3d 105, 114

(1st Cir. 2015)).

       The Government concludes that Mr. McCurdy had four ACCA predicate

convictions and was properly deemed subject to the ACCA enhancements under the

statute and guidelines. Id. at 18.

       C.     Mark McCurdy’s Reply




3      Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13 (2005).

                                                8
      In his reply, Mr. McCurdy argues that Duquette is not controlling, that his

Maine burglary convictions are not generic, and that they fail to satisfy the

enumerated clause of the ACCA. Def.’s Reply at 1. After Johnson II, Mr. McCurdy

says the Maine burglary convictions are no longer ACCA predicates because the

Maine statute includes some vehicles and conveyances as structures. Id.

      Mr. McCurdy first addresses the law of the circuit doctrine. Id. at 17. He

contends that the United States Supreme Court decision in Mathis overrules

Duquette. Id. at 18–19. He also disagrees with the Government’s reliance on Herrold,

noting that the Acting Solicitor General has agreed that Mr. Herrold’s petition for

writ of certiorari should be granted and the Fifth Circuit’s judgment vacated in light

of Mathis.   Id. at 19.   Moreover, Mr. McCurdy argues that the First Circuit’s

declaration in Duquette that Maine’s burglary statute corresponds to “generic”

burglary is merely dictum. Id. at 20. Mr. McCurdy explains that Mr. Duquette’s

appellate counsel conceded that the Maine burglary statute was consistent with a

generic burglary. Mr. McCurdy points out that Mr. Duquette’s appellate counsel

instead chose to “inexplicably” argue that the Career Offender guideline, U.S.S.G. §

4B1.1, did not apply to him, even though he was sentenced under the ACCA. Id. at

17, 20. Because the First Circuit did not need to reach the question of whether

Maine’s burglary statute corresponded to the generic burglary to decide Mr.

Duquette’s appeal, Mr. McCurdy argues that Duquette is not binding precedent on

this Court’s interpretation of the ACCA. Id. at 20–21.




                                          9
       Mr. McCurdy also addresses caselaw in other jurisdictions and cites cases

where courts have, in his view, deemed statutes similar to Maine’s burglary statute

as non-generic. Id. at 12–17.

       Finally, Mr. McCurdy disputes whether his robberies are properly deemed

ACCA predicates. Id. at 22–25. He points out that in Jackson v. United States, No.

2:06-cr-94-GZS (D. Me. June 6, 2016), Judge Singal of this District reviewed Maine’s

robbery statute and concluded that robbery involving the use of “physical force”—as

Maine courts interpret the term—was not sufficient to satisfy the violent force

requirement of Johnson v. United States, 559 U.S. 133 (2010) (Johnson I). Id. at 22–

23. Mr. McCurdy explains that his own robbery conviction merely involved the

“threatened” use of physical force—as opposed to the actual use of physical force in

Jackson—and therefore, his conviction likewise should not qualify as a ACCA

predicate. Id. at 23.

       Additionally, Mr. McCurdy disputes the contention that it makes a difference

that he was charged with being armed with a dangerous weapon when he committed

these robberies. Id. at 23 (“The mere addition of a dangerous weapon does not change

the result”). He concludes that the robberies “no longer qualify.” Id. at 25.

       Mr. McCurdy concludes that neither his prior burglary convictions nor his

prior robbery convictions are predicates to ACCA status and that the Court “should

vacate his ACCA-based sentence and re-sentence him.” Id. at 25.

III.   DISCUSSION

       A.    The Maine Burglary Convictions as ACCA Predicates



                                          10
       In assessing Mr. McCurdy’s arguments about his prior burglary convictions,

the Court does not start with a blank slate. Other judges of this District have issued

three opinions concluding that “recent First Circuit precedent establishes that Maine

burglary convictions are ‘violent felonies’ pursuant to ACCA’s enumerated clause.”4

Dimott v. United States, Nos. 2:06-cr-26-GZS, 2:16-cv-347-GZS, 2016 U.S. Dist.

LEXIS 142354, at *8 (D. Me. Oct. 14, 2016); see Collamore v. United States, Nos. 2:16-

cv-259-GZS, 2:10-cr-158-GZS, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 148757, at *6 (Oct. 27, 2016);

United States v. Casey, Nos. 2:11-cr-216-DBH, 2:16-cv-346-DBH, 2016 U.S. Dist.

LEXIS 153085 (D. Me. Nov. 3, 2016).

       In Dimott, the district judge concluded (1) that a defendant whose sentence

was enhanced under the ACCA’s enumerated clause may not claim that Johnson II

and Welch v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 1257 (2016) announced a retroactively-

applicable, newly-recognized right, (2) that Duquette is the “‘law of the circuit’ and

this Court is bound by it unless and until the First Circuit decides to revisit Duquette,”

(3) there is “no basis for concluding that Mathis should be read as overruling

Duquette,” and (4) that Mathis “does not present the ‘extremely rare circumstance[]’

where Duquette would no longer be binding precedent on this Court.” Id. at *5–9.

Even though it was “understandable” that Mr. Dimott would claim that Maine

statutory definition of “structure” “categorically reach[es] a broader range of places




4      The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals recently cited Dimott for its conclusion that Mathis did not
announce a new substantive rule retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review because the
Supreme Court made it clear it was not breaking new ground in Mathis. See United States v. Taylor,
No. 16-6223, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 21701, at *12 (10th Cir. Dec. 6, 2016); see also Raines v. Fox, No.
CIV-16-1036-R, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 148195, at *2, n.1 (W.D. Okla. Oct. 26, 2016).

                                                 11
than generic burglary,” the district judge concluded that Duquette “currently provides

a binding answer to that question within the First Circuit.” Id. at *10–11. In

resolving Mr. McCurdy’s contentions about his burglary convictions, this Court

“follow[s] Dimott and appl[ies] Duquette.” Casey, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153085, at

*15.

       This conclusion does not imply that Mr. McCurdy’s arguments about his

burglary convictions are not substantial. As another judge in this District notes,

Mathis “casts significant doubt on the continued vitality of Duquette.” Id. at *16. In

Casey, the Court observed that “Maine’s burglary statute, which encompasses

camping vehicles, trailers, sleeper trains, and airplanes and boats with sleeping

accommodations, seems to have a broader locational element than generic burglary.”

Id. But, as in Dimott, Collamore, and Casey, this Court must “leave that conclusion

to the First Circuit.” Id. at *16. The Court follows the lead of the district judges in

this District by issuing a certificate of appealability on these questions. Dimott, 2016

U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142354, at *11–12; Collamore, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 148757, at

*6–7; Casey, 2016 U.S. Dist. 153085, at *16; see Casey, Nos. 2:11-cr-216-DBH, Order

Issuing Certificate of Appealability at 1 (ECF No. 78).

       B.    The Robbery Convictions as ACCA Predicates

       Mr. McCurdy has another arrow in his quiver. To qualify as an armed career

criminal, the ACCA requires a defendant to have “three previous convictions…for a

violent felony.”   18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1).      Assuming that the two prior burglary

convictions count under the enumerated clause of the ACCA, Mr. McCurdy must still



                                          12
have one additional “violent felony” in order to qualify for the ACCA enhancement.

In order to reach ACCA status, therefore, one or both of Mr. McCurdy’s prior robberies

must count as a predicate ACCA felony.

      As with the burglary convictions, this Court does not start with a blank slate

regarding Mr. McCurdy’s arguments about his prior robbery convictions.             In

Collamore, the district judge observed that he had recently held “that Maine robbery

is not categorically an ACCA predicate offense pursuant to the force clause.”

Collamore, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 148757, at *6, n.2 (citing Jackson v. United States,

No. 2:16-cv-187-GZS, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73052, at *3 (D. Me. June 6, 2016)). The

Court turns to Jackson.

      In Jackson, a defendant had been previously convicted of violating Maine’s

robbery statute, 17-A M.R.S. § 651. Id. at *1–3. The district judge concluded that

section 651 was “divisible” under Descamps v. United States, 133 S. Ct. 2276, 2284

(2013). Id. at *3. As a result, the district judge reviewed the Shepard-approved

documents in accordance with the modified categorical approach, focusing on the

“force” language in the Jackson indictment. Id. at *3–4. The indictment read “DAVID

S. JACKSON…did commit or attempt to commit theft by obtaining or exercising

unauthorized control over the property of [the victim]…and at the time of said theft,

Defendant did use force upon [victim].” Id. (emphasis and alterations in opinion).

The district judge determined that the language contained in the indictment

corresponded to 17-A M.R.S. § 651(1)(C), which penalizes a person who “uses physical

force on another…” Id. at *4.



                                         13
         To qualify as a “violent felony” under Johnson I, the defendant must have used

“violent force—that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another

person.” Johnson I, 559 U.S. at 140. However, the district judge in Jackson noted

that the Maine Supreme Judicial Court ruled that “any physical force” would be

sufficient to satisfy the force requirement in the Maine robbery statute. Id. at *5

(quoting Raymond v. State, 467 A.2d 161, 164-65 (Me. 1983)). Consequently, the

district judge resolved that he “could not conclude that the physical force Jackson

used upon his victim to extract the money, which was the focus of the theft element,

was necessarily force capable of causing physical pain or injury to the victim.” Id. at

*6–7. He therefore declined to conclude that Mr. Jackson’s Maine robbery conviction

was an ACCA-qualifying conviction as a violent felony under the “force clause.” Id.

at *7.

         Here, the Court accepts the premise that section 651, the Maine robbery

statute, is divisible. At the time of Mr. McCurdy’s convictions, section 651 read:

         1. A person is guilty of robbery if he commits or attempts to commit
            theft and at the time of his actions:

            A. He recklessly inflicts bodily injury on another;

            B. He threatens to use force against any person present with intent:

               1. to prevent or overcome resistance to the taking of the property,
                  or to the retention of the property immediately after the
                  taking; or

               2. to compel the person in control of the property to give it up or
                  to engage in other conduct which aids in the taking or carrying
                  away of the property;




                                            14
           C. He uses physical force on another with the intent enumerated in
              paragraph B, subparagraphs (1) or (2);

           D. He intentionally inflicts or attempts to inflict bodily injury on
              another; or

           E. He or an accomplice to his knowledge is armed with a dangerous
              weapon in the course of a robbery as defined in paragraphs A
              through D.

       2. Robbery as defined in subsection 1, paragraphs A and B, is a Class B
          crime. Robbery as defined in subsection 1, paragraphs C, D, and E
          is a Class A Crime.

17-A M.R.S. § 651 (1975).

       The Government supplied the indictment in state court in 1983, charging Mr.

McCurdy with two counts of robbery—one an attempted robbery and the other a

successful robbery.5 The state court indictment reads:

       AND THE GRAND JURY CHARGES: COUNT I

       That on or about the 10th day of March, 1983, in the County of
       Penobscot, State of Maine, MARK MCCURDY did attempt to commit
       theft, to wit, did attempt to obtain or exercise unauthorized control over
       the property of the [victim], to wit, drugs, with the intent to deprive said
       [victim] thereof, and at the time of his actions, he threatened to use force
       against any person present, to wit, [the victim], with the intent to compel
       the person in control of the property, to wit, [the victim], to give it up or
       to engage in other conduct which aids in the taking or carrying away of
       the property and he or an accomplice to his knowledge was armed with
       a dangerous weapon, to wit, a firearm, in the course of the robbery.

       AND THE GRAND JURY FURTHER CHARGES: COUNT II

       That on or about the 10th day of March, 1983, in the County of
       Penobscot, State of Maine, MARK MCCURDY did commit theft, to wit,

5       The state court indictment is one of the limited documents that the Supreme Court held that
a court may review under the modified categorical approach. Shepard, 544 U.S. at 26 (“We hold that
enquiry under the ACCA to determine whether a plea to a burglary defined by a nongeneric statute
necessarily admitted elements of the generic offense is limited to the terms of the charging
document…or to some comparable judicial record of this information”).

                                                15
       did attempt to obtain or exercise unauthorized control over the property
       of the [victim], to wit, drugs, with the intent to deprive said [victim]
       thereof, and at the time of his actions, he threatened to use force against
       any person present, to wit, [the victim], with the intent to compel the
       person in control of the property, to wit, [the victim], to give it up or to
       engage in other conduct which aids in the taking or carrying away of the
       property and he or an accomplice to his knowledge was armed with a
       dangerous weapon, to wit, a firearm, in the course of the robbery.

Gov’t’s Opp’n, Attach. 3, Indictment for Violation of 17-A M.R.S.A. Section 651

ROBBERY (Class A Crime) (ECF No. 391) (Indictment).6 Comparing the Maine

robbery statute to the indictment, Mr. McCurdy was charged with violating 17-A

M.R.S. § 651(1)(B)(2): “A person is guilty of robbery if the person commits theft or

attempts to commit theft and at the time of the person’s actions: (B) the actor

threatens to use force against any person present with the intent (2) to compel the

person in control of the property to give it up or to engage in other conduct that aids

in the taking or carrying away of the property.” If this were all that the State alleged,

the Jackson case would be persuasive authority for finding that neither robbery was

a violent felony within the meaning of the ACCA.

       However, one obvious difference between Jackson and Mr. McCurdy’s case is

that Mr. McCurdy was also charged with being armed with a dangerous weapon

under section 651(1)(E).7 Accordingly, the Court must perform a slightly different


6       The Government also attached the state court judgment. Gov’t’s Opp’n, Attach. 4, Judgment
and Commitment at 1 (ECF No. 391). Other than confirming that Mr. McCurdy pleaded guilty to both
robbery charges and was convicted of Class A robberies, the judgment does not illuminate the issue
before the Court. Id.
7       The indictment does not reveal whether Mr. McCurdy or his accomplice was the one armed
with the dangerous weapon. Indictment at 1. However, the indictment alleges that “he or an
accomplice to his knowledge was armed with a dangerous weapon, to wit, a firearm, in the course of
the robbery.” Id. Neither the Government nor Mr. McCurdy has suggested that it would make a
difference to the Court’s analysis whether he actually carried the firearm or whether he robbed the
pharmacies with an accomplice who he knew was carrying a firearm.

                                                16
analysis to determine whether being armed with a dangerous weapon—as opposed to

using or threatening to use physical force—is sufficient to constitute a violent felony

under the ACCA.

      To prove that a defendant (or his accomplice) was “armed with a dangerous

weapon” under section 651(1)(E), the Maine Supreme Judicial Court held that the

state must demonstrate that the defendant was in “actual possession of a firearm”

within the definition of Maine law. State v. Zaccadelli, 472 A.2d 928, 932 (Me. 1984);

see 17-A M.R.S. § 2(9)(B)(1) (“‘Armed with a dangerous weapon’ means in actual

possession, regardless of whether the possession is visible or concealed, of: (1) a

firearm”). Maine law defined “firearm” as “any weapon, whether loaded or unloaded,

which is designed to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive.” 17-A M.R.S. §

2(12-A). In Zaccadelli, the defendant argued that even though he (or his accomplice)

possessed a pistol that was used in the robbery, the State had failed to prove that the

pistol was operable as required by the definition of “firearm.” 472 A.2d at 931. The

Maine Law Court rejected the argument, quoting the definition of “armed with a

dangerous weapon” in 17-A M.R.S. § 2(9):

      For purposes of this subsection, a thing presented in a covered or open
      manner as a dangerous weapon shall be presumed to be a dangerous
      weapon.

Id. at 932; see State v. Flash, 418 A.2d 158, 162 (Me. 1980) (approving a jury

instruction that stated “If a thing is presented as a weapon in an open or covered

manner, you are permitted…to infer that the thing was a dangerous weapon and

conclude…that it was a dangerous weapon”).



                                          17
      The Court turns to whether, as explained by the Maine Supreme Judicial

Court, the Maine crime of robbery while armed with a dangerous weapon transforms

the crime of robbery into a violent felony under the ACCA. The answer is not easy.

As the First Circuit just commented in United States v. Tavares, No. 14-2319, 2016

U.S. App. LEXIS 21491 (1st Cir. Dec. 1, 2016), this type of analysis can lead a court

“down several rabbit holes” and into a “Rube Goldberg jurisprudence of abstractions

piled on top of one another in a manner that renders doubtful anyone’s confidence in

predicting what will pop out at the end.” Id. at *41–42 (addressing “crime of violence”

under the career criminal enhancement in U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2). But, in Tavares’ words,

“[w]hat pops out matters a great deal.” Id.

      To add to a degree of irreducible vagueness, Maine decisional law has not

addressed all of the critical questions presented here. For guidance, the Court turns

to jurisprudence arising out of the commonwealth of Massachusetts’ armed robbery

statute. The Massachusetts offense of armed robbery has two elements: (1) that the

defendant commits a robbery (2) while in possession of a weapon. Compare 17-A

M.R.S. § 651(1)(e), with MASS. GEN. LAWS ch. 265,8 § 17; King v. MacEachern, 665


8     Chapter 265 of the Massachusetts General Laws reads:

      Whoever, being armed with a dangerous weapon, assaults another and robs, steals or
      takes from his person money or other property which may be the subject of larceny
      shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life or for any term of years;
      provided, however, that any person who commits any offence described herein while
      masked or disguised or while having his features artificially distorted shall, for the
      first offence be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than five years and for any
      subsequent offence for not less than ten years. Whoever commits any offense described
      herein while armed with a firearm, shotgun, rifle, machine gun or assault weapon shall
      be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not less than five years. Any
      person who commits a subsequent offense while armed with a firearm, shotgun, rifle,
      machine gun or assault weapon shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison
      for not less than 15 years.

                                                18
F.3d 247, 253 (1st Cir. 2011) (citing Commonwealth v. Tevlin, 433 Mass. 305, 741

N.E.2d 827, 833 (2001)). For purposes of this analysis, the robbery portion of the

Massachusetts statute has been interpreted consistently with the robbery portion of

the Maine statute in that both laws treat a de minimis use of force, such as snatching

a purse, as fitting within the definition of robbery. See Raymond, 467 A.2d at 164

(interpreting § 651(1)(B)); Commonwealth v. Jones, 362 Mass. 83, 283 N.E.2d 840,

845 (1972). Neither Maine nor Massachusetts’ statute would meet the “violent force”

requisite under the ACCA’s force clause. Jackson, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73052, at

*6; United States v. Dubose, criminal action no. 04-10291-RGS, civil action no. 16-

11214-RGS, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 174994, at *5 (D. Mass. Dec. 19, 2016).

      Whether the firearm possession is sufficient to bring Mr. McCurdy’s case

within the ACCA is more difficult. Although the Maine and Massachusetts statutory

language is not identical, it is similar. 17-A M.R.S. § 651(1)(e) (“The actor is armed

with a dangerous weapon”); MASS. GEN. LAWS ch. 265, § 17 (“Whoever, being armed

with a dangerous weapon”).         Interpreting the Massachusetts language, the

Massachusetts courts have concluded that “a dangerous weapon need play no part in

the robbery itself, nor need the victim even be aware of its presence.” Dubose, 2016

U.S. Dist. LEXIS 174994, at *5 (citing King, 665 F.3d at 253 & n.7). Indeed, in

Massachusetts, “a robbery may be committed even if the victim is not placed in fear”

and there is no requirement that the robber actually “harbored a willingness to inflict

bodily harm or otherwise use violent force against a victim.” Id. at 7. “All that is

required is a showing of de minimis force, which is insufficient to clear the threshold



                                          19
established in Johnson I.” Id. In reaching the conclusion that a conviction for an

armed robbery in Massachusetts does not meet the violent force requisite in the

ACCA, the district judge concurred with United States v. Parnell, 818 F.3d 974 (9th

Cir. 2016), a Ninth Circuit decision interpreting the Massachusetts armed robbery

statute. Id. at 4, 7; see also United States v. Redrick, 841 F.3d 478, 484 (D.C. Cir.

2016).

         The decisional law in Maine is not as clear on this issue as in Massachusetts,

but the language of the Maine statute is consistent with the Dubose and Parnell

analyses. The Maine statute elevates a robbery from a Class B crime to a Class A

crime if the robber “is armed” with a dangerous weapon. 17-A M.R.S. § 651(1)(E).

Maine courts have not gone so far as to say it does not matter if the victim even knows

that the robber has the weapon. But by its terms, the Maine statute does not require

that the robber actively use the weapon to commit the robbery in order to violate

section 651(1)(E), only that the robber possess it “in the course of the robbery.” Id.

Without more, the possession of a firearm during a robbery does not therefore

transform the robbery to one where the robber used “violent force” under the ACCA’s

force clause.

         The Government analogizes the Maine armed robbery statute to United States

v. Whindleton, 797 F.3d 105 (1st Cir. 2015), where the First Circuit addressed the

Massachusetts crime of assault with a dangerous weapon and concluded that it was

properly a predicate ACCA offense. But as the Whindleton Court explained, the

Massachusetts assault with a dangerous weapon statute imposes “the additional



                                           20
element that the assault must be accomplished ‘by means of a dangerous weapon.’”

Id. at 114 (quoting MASS. GEN. LAWS ch. 265, § 15B(b)). In Dubose, the federal district

court in Massachusetts noted that the absence of a requirement that the weapon

plays a part in the Massachusetts armed robbery statute “makes armed robbery

unlike other offenses in Massachusetts, such as an assault with a dangerous weapon,

where the presence of the weapon ‘imports the “violent force” required by Johnson

into’ an otherwise overbroad statute.” Dubose, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 174994, at *5

(quoting Whindleton, 797 F.3d at 114).

       Nor is the Court bound by its own decision in United States v. Mulkern, 15-cr-

54-JAW. The main issue in Mulkern was a complicated question about whether the

defendant’s prior drug conviction was a qualifying offense under the ACCA and

whether the prior burglary and robbery were “committed on occasions different from

one another.” 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1); United States v. Mulkern, 1:15-cr-00054-JAW-1,

Tr. of Proceedings, Sentencing Proceedings 8:7–24:11 (ECF No. 61) (Mulkern

Sentencing Tr.). Whether Mr. Mulkern’s robbery conviction was a qualifying offense

was summarily briefed, see Mulkern, Gov’t’s Mem. in Aid of Sentencing (ECF No. 46),

Def.’s Sentencing Mem. at 6–8 (ECF No. 48), Gov’t’s Reply to the Def.’s Sentencing

Mem. (ECF No. 49), argued, and resolved. Mulkern Sentencing Tr. 24:17–25:4.9 But

more significantly, Mr. Mulkern’s robbery conviction stemmed from a different

section of 651 than Mr. McCurdy was convicted of violating. Mr. Mulkern was



9      The Court agrees with Mr. McCurdy’s diplomatic statement that “[m]uch has changed” since
2004 when the Court decided United States v. Bishop, 350 F. Supp. 2d 117 (D. Me. 2004). See Def.’s
Reply at 24.

                                               21
charged and convicted of violating 17-A M.R.S. § 651(1)(A), which required that the

Government prove the defendant “recklessly inflicts bodily injury on another.” On its

face, the infliction of bodily injury would appear to meet the Johnson I requirement

of “violent force—that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another

person.” Johnson I, 559 U.S. at 140.

       In short, the Court concludes that the armed robberies with which Mark

McCurdy has been charged and convicted do not meet the violent force requirement

of the ACCA as explained by the Supreme Court in Johnson I and Johnson II.

IV.    CONCLUSION

       With the elimination of the two armed robbery convictions, Mark McCurdy has

two predicate ACCA violent felonies; the ACCA requires three. 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1)

(“three previous convictions”). This means the ACCA does not apply to him, and

instead of a fifteen-year mandatory statutory minimum and an enhanced sentencing

guideline range, Mark McCurdy faces a ten-year maximum. 18 U.S.C. § 924(a)(2).

The Court therefore GRANTS Mark McCurdy’s motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (ECF

No. 378) and DISMISSES as moot his Motion Under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 to Vacate, Set

Aside, or Correct Sentencing by a Person in Federal Custody (ECF No. 380). The

Court will set the matter ahead for a conference of counsel to discuss re-sentencing.10




10      This decision will require a recalculation of Mr. McCurdy’s guideline sentence range. If, as
recalculated, Mr. McCurdy has either over-served or is close to over-serving his newly-calculated
guideline sentence range, the Court assumes that counsel will quickly inform the Court so that it can
expedite Mr. McCurdy’s resentencing.
