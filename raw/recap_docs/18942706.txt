                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                       DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America,
      Plaintiff

             v.                              Case No. 10-cr-17-01-SM

Jesse Sullivan,
      Defendant

                                    ORDER

      Defendant Sullivan’s motion to continue the trial is granted (document no.

9). Trial has been rescheduled for the July trial period. Defendant Sullivan

shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights not later than May 21, 2010.   On the

filing of such waiver, his continuance shall be effective.

      The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial,

18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would

unreasonably deny the defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances.

      Final Pretrial Conference is scheduled for July 9, 2010 at 3:00 p.m.

      Jury selection will take place on July 20, 2010 at 9:30 a.m.
