STATEMENT OF REASONS

VII COURT DETERMINATIONS OF RESTITUTION
A m Restit'ution Not Applicable.

B Total Amount of Restitution:

 

C Restitution not ordered (Check only one.);

l l:l For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

2 l___l For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex

issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the nced to provide restitution to any victim would be outwcighcd by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(13).

3 l:l For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U»S.C. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
ordered because the complication and prolongation ofthe sentencing process resulting from the fashioning ofa restitution order outweigh

the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U.S.C, § 3663(a)(1)(B)(ii).

4 [:l Restitution is not ordered for other reasons (Explain.)

D l:] Partial restitution is ordered for these reasons (18 U.S.C. § 3553(<:)):

VIII ADDITIONAL FACTS JUSTIFYING THE SENTENCE IN THIS CASE (If applicable.)

Finding for the defendant under Section 851(c)(2), the 851 enhancement was not implemented The Court did not recognize the
conviction related to the 851 filing as a predicate offense on grounds of constitutionally insufficient evidence in the state case.
