                                                      Facts


        Daniel Moriarty appears again before this Court for a violation of the terms of his

supervised release but, more importantly, for almost killing himself by overdosing on heroin.

The initial reaction to such conduct is to despair, incarcerate Mr. Moriarty at great expense, and

then engage in supervision that has not worked. So, is there a “middle ground” that might offer

some hope that Mr. Moriarty might continue to work?



        Thus, the Court, which reminded him during our last appearance that when he

transgresses in the federal court unpleasantness will follow, must craft a punishment that will be

a daily reminder of the “error of his ways” yet allow him to work under strict supervision.




                                                         2

       Starting from the baseline of the Probation Department’s recommendation of a twelve-

month sentence, what will such a sentence do for Moriarty or the body politic? Sadly, not much

except cost taxpayers $30,000 a year with no treatment for Moriarty, as a sentence of that length

hardly gets him settled before he is on the way out the door. It satisfies the penological thinking

of the 1800’s but, as we all know, too much reflection, as the Arabs say, addles the brain.



       There is a way and that way is that Moriarty be sentenced to a Halfway House with

stringent conditions and be allowed to work thus saving the taxpayers money. He will be in a

tightly controlled environment, subject to all the temptations of the “outside” world but forced to

live his life with others who will either make him see the error of his ways or join him in the

descent to the Ninth Circle. Punishment is called for here, but it should be punishment with a

purpose other than reflection and a punishment that capitalizes on Moriarty’s ability to be a

productive member of society. Taking that element out of the sentencing equation makes

everyone a loser in this matter.

                                            Conclusion

     THE COURT SHOULD ORDER THAT ANY SENTENCE IMPOSED BE SERVED IN
A HALFWAY HOUSE AND THAT MORIARTY BE GAINFULLY EMPLOYED.
