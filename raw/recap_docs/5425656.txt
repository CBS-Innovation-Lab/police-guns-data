          v.                       )      CRIMINAL NO. 04-10127-NG
                                   )
SEAN SLATER                        )


        ASSENTED-TO MOTION FOR PRE-PLEA PRESENTENCE REPORT

     Defendant Sean Slater respectfully reports to the Court

about the status of the case and moves for an order that the

United States Probation Department commence preparation of a pre-

plea presentence report.     As grounds for this motion, defendant

states that the parties have exchanged a plea agreement which

will resolve the case, and expect it to be signed (with allowance

for delays in securing defendantâ€™s signature since he is

convalescing in a New York rehabilitation facility) within a

week.   Accordingly, the parties ask that the Court cancel the

status conference set for Monday, January 22, 2007, and schedule

this case for a combined Rule 11 and sentencing proceeding

approximately ninety days hence, with an order to the United

States Probation Office to commence preparation of a presentence

report forthwith.

     The United States, by Assistant United States Attorney

Fred M. Wyshak, Jr., assented to this motion.
