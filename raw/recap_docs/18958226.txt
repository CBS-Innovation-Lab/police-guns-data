                UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                      DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

           v.                           Criminal No. 10-cr-32-01-JD

James Meattey


                                O R D E R


      The assented to motion to reschedule jury trial (document no.

35) filed by defendant is granted.        The continuance is limited to

60 days.    Trial is continued to the two-week period beginning

January 4, 2011, at 9:30 AM.       As Co-defendant Megann Glidden has

assented to the continuance, her trial is also continued to the

January 4, 2011 trial period.

      Defendant Meattey shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights

within 10 days.     The court finds that the ends of justice served by

granting a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and

the defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv), for

the reasons set forth in the motion.

      SO ORDERED.



                                        /s/ Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr.
