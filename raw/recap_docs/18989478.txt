                UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                      DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

           v.                           Criminal No. 11-cr-89-01-JD

Richard E. Parks


                                O R D E R


      The assented to motion to reschedule jury trial (document no.

11) filed by defendant is granted; the continuance is limited to

30 days.   Trial is continued to the two-week period beginning

December 13, 2011, 9:30 a.m.

      Defendant shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights within 10

days.   The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting

a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ' 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv), for the

reasons set forth in the motion.

      SO ORDERED.



                                        /s/ Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr.
