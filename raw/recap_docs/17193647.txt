                        MEMORANDUM AND ORDER

WOLF, D.J.                                              June 25, 2008

     Defendant Theron Davis is serving a 133 month sentence for

using a telephone to facilitate transactions involving cocaine

base. As a result of Amendment 706 to the United States Sentencing

Guidelines ("U.S.S.G."), which generally retroactively reduces by

two levels the offense level for crimes involving crack cocaine and

became effective March 3, 2008, Davis moved for a reduction of his

sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) and U.S.S.G. §1B1.10

(the "Motion").    As Davis is indigent, counsel was appointed to

represent him. The government and counsel for the defendant have

conferred and filed a Joint Status Report concerning the Motion.

     Defendant argues, and Probation agrees, that Davis is eligible

for a sentence reduction because he was sentenced based on a

guideline range that has subsequently been lowered by retroactive

amendment. See 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10. Judge

Nancy Gertner found that Criminal History Category VI overstated

the seriousness of Davis's criminal history and departed downward

to Criminal History Category IV. Davis calculates, and Probation

concurs, that if Judge Gertner's downward departure on criminal
        Case 1:98-cr-10185-MLW Document 1979 Filed 06/25/08 Page 2 of 3



history    is    maintained,      the     amended    advisory      guideline    range

applicable to Davis given a Total Offense Level of 27 and Criminal

History Category IV is 100 to 125 months in custody. Defendant

requests a reduction in sentence to 120 months, but he has already

served    the    equivalent    of      approximately     a   124    month   sentence

including "good time" credit. Davis, as a practical matter, seeks

a Time Served sentence, which would reduce his time in custody by

less than 9 months. See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10(b)(2)(C) ("In no event

may the reduced term of imprisonment be less than the term of

imprisonment the defendant has already served.").

     The       government   has     not   disputed     the   calculation       of   the

guideline range applicable under the amended advisory guidelines.

Instead, the government argues that Davis's guideline range would

have been much higher if not for a beneficial plea agreement, and

therefore "the crack amendment does not meaningfully reduce the

defendant's true guideline range or bear on the equities." Joint

Status Report at 3. However, a sentence of Time Served is within

the range of agreed dispositions contemplated by the parties'

binding plea agreement and represents only a slight reduction of

his 133 month sentence. See Plea Agreement at 3. Although Davis's

disciplinary records show a few incidents in 2003 and 2006, he

evidently has presented no problem since 2006. While in prison,

Davis    has    participated      in    college     correspondence     courses      and

numerous other classes, and he was approved for work in food

service and on other correctional work details. Cf. U.S.S.G.

§1B1.10. A.N. 1(B)(ii) & (iii).

     Having considered the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) factors, the court

finds that Davis is eligible for a sentence reduction and that such

a reduction is warranted.     Therefore, it is hereby ORDERED that:

     1.   The Motion (Docket No. 1952) is ALLOWED.

     2.   The defendant's sentence is REDUCED to Time Served.

     3.   The term and conditions of Supervised Release previously

imposed are not altered.

     4.   The   attached    Order   Regarding    Motion   for   Sentence

Reduction Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) shall enter forthwith.
