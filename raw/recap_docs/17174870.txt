                            April 4, 2008
     Defendant Steven Childs has been charged in a one-count

indictment with possession of a firearm and ammunition after

having been convicted of a felony offense, in violation of 18

U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).   He seeks to suppress certain evidence

developed during three separate incidents involving

investigations by the Brockton police: (1) the fruits of a

traffic stop during which he was detained on June 29, 2006, (2)

items seized during a June 29, 2006 search of an apartment after

the traffic stop, and (3) statements he made to the Brockton

police in connection with a separate incident on July 5, 2006.

                        I.   FINDINGS OF FACT

     I make the following findings of fact on the basis of the

testimony and related exhibits offered during the three days of

hearings on the motion to suppress.

A.   The June 29, 2006 Tip

     At approximately 7:20 p.m. on June 29, 2006, Detective James



                                     1
         Case 1:06-cr-10339-DPW Document 72 Filed 04/04/08 Page 2 of 34



Smith of the Brockton Police Department received information from

a confidential informant (“CI”) through Juvenile Probation

Officer William Cavanaugh that Steven Childs, a black male, 6' 1"

tall, was carrying a black knapsack containing an Uzi machine gun

with a big magazine.       The CI stated that Childs and a black male

were driving around Brockton in a white Mercedes Benz with a

license plate of 5ZPGI.        The CI further stated that the car might

be at 34 Coburn Street in Brockton.

     Detective Smith drove to Coburn Street where he observed a

white Mercedes matching the description provided by the CI parked

across the street from 34 Coburn Street.           Smith observed the

license plate of the car and found it to be a partial match of

that provided by the CI.        He also noted that there were two black

men in the car.      Smith recognized Steven Childs, whom he had seen

in connection with another investigation, as one of the men.

Smith radioed the location of the car to other officers who

subsequently came to the area.         Smith then observed Childs and

the other man get out of the car and enter 34 Coburn Street.1

Neither man was seen carrying the black bag the CI had described.

B.   The June 29, 2006 Traffic Stop

     1
     Three apartment units were located at 34 Coburn Street,
including the second floor residence of Veronica Tubbs and her
three children. During June 2006, Childs had spent some time
visiting and staying overnight at 34 Coburn Street.
Specifically, Childs stayed at Tubbs’ apartment “sporadically”,
spending between three to four nights a week there and visiting
the apartment on other days, from mid-June until the night of his
arrest on June 29, 2006.

                                       2
        Case 1:06-cr-10339-DPW Document 72 Filed 04/04/08 Page 3 of 34



     At approximately 9:20 p.m., after conducting surveillance

for about two hours, Smith saw three individuals leave 34 Coburn

Street and get into the white Mercedes.         None of them was

carrying a bag when they left the house.          The car contained

Childs, who was riding in the front passenger seat, Andrew

Brewer, who was the driver, and a woman who was riding in the

backseat.    The Mercedes started moving down the street and

several unmarked police cars followed.

     Approximately ten minutes later, the police conducted a

motor vehicle stop because the car had swerved across the solid

double yellow line on two occasions on Battles Street.            Other

police cars and officers arrived shortly after the initial stop.

The Mercedes was blocked front, back and on the side by police

cars.    Six to eight police officers then approached the car.

Half of the officers had their guns drawn.          The officers demanded

that the passengers in the car show their hands.           As the police

approached the car, Officer Daniel Matukas observed that Childs

was moving his left hand downward near the console.           Matukas also

saw Childs throw a small bag towards the back seat.             Matukas

suspected the bag contained contraband.         It was not until Matukas

made a third demand to the passengers to show their hands that

Childs and Brewer put their hands up.

     All three passengers were removed from the car and held to

the ground.     Police then searched the passengers.        A search of

the vehicle was also conducted and the bag that Matukas observed

                                      3
        Case 1:06-cr-10339-DPW Document 72 Filed 04/04/08 Page 4 of 34



Childs throw was found.       Childs was arrested for possession of

marijuana.     Childs received his Miranda rights and indicated that

he understood those rights.       The police, however, did not find

the black bag or firearm in the car.

C.      The June 29, 2006 Search at 34 Coburn Street

        After the traffic stop and arrests, several officers,

including Detective Erik Hilliard, Lieutenant LaFratta, and

Detective Jeffery Costello, went to 34 Coburn Street to look for

the black bag and gun.       Hilliard arrived first.      Hilliard

informed Tubbs, the second-floor tenant, see note 1 supra, that

the police were conducting a narcotics investigation even though

the real purpose of their investigation was to locate the firearm

the CI had described.      Hilliard then asked Tubbs about Childs.

Tubbs said that Childs had stayed in her apartment for about a

week.    She said she allowed him to stay in her apartment because

he told her that he had no where else to go.          She also indicated

that she thought Childs and his friends were selling drugs out of

a vacant third-floor apartment at 34 Coburn Street.           Hilliard

checked the third-floor apartment, found no occupants or

contraband, and returned to the second floor.          By the time

Hilliard returned, LaFratta and Costello had arrived.

     Hilliard introduced LaFratta to Tubbs.          When asked, Tubbs

stated that Childs had a black pull-string bag that she thought

he might put his toiletries in.        She also told the police that


                                      4
          Case 1:06-cr-10339-DPW Document 72 Filed 04/04/08 Page 5 of 34



the black bag was in her daughter’s bedroom.            She never indicated

to the police that the bag was hers2 or that she had control over

it.   Hilliard asked her if the bag could be “where [Childs] puts

his narcotics?”       Tubbs responded she did not know.        At that

point, the police presented Tubbs with a written consent form

which she reviewed, signed, and dated.           Tubbs proceeded to direct

the police to her daughter’s bedroom and indicated the bag was in

the closet.3


      2
     Although the police did not develop this information before
conducting the search, Tubbs had never looked inside of the bag
and she did not have direct knowledge regarding its contents.
She never touched or handled the bag or moved it. She never
discussed with Childs what he was going to do with the bag.
      3
     Tubbs' testimony regarding Childs, the bag, and her
apartment is not entirely consistent. On the one hand, Tubbs
stated that Childs took the bag with him when he left her
apartment. For example, she testified that “[h]e would take [the
bag] with him when he got up to leave, he would take it with
him.” Tubbs also told the police the night of the search that
the “bag belonged to him, and that usually when he leaves he
takes it with him, but, you know, it comes and goes with him.”
However, Tubbs also indicated that Childs left the bag at her
apartment. Asked, for example, "When was the first time you
noticed a bag that Stephen Childs had with him?" she answered, “I
don’t know the exact date, but I do remember him asking me was it
okay for him to leave a bag there and me saying yes.” On the
night of the search, Tubbs knew the bag was in her daughter’s
closet because, as she testified, "at that point I knew that he
was keeping it in there, because he’d say can he go get the bag
out of the closet. When [her daughter] wasn’t home, he would ask
can he go in there and get the bag, and I’d say yes.” Tubbs
stated she gave Childs permission to store the bag in her house;
she knew that he stored the bag in her daughter’s closet, and
knew that he stored the bag in the closet even when he wasn’t at
the house. As she testified, “once my daughter put it into her
closet, that’s where he kept it. And he could go and get it and
put it back at his leisure, and he didn’t check in every time
that he went and got it or check out every time he picked it up.”

                                        5
     Case 1:06-cr-10339-DPW Document 72 Filed 04/04/08 Page 6 of 34



     After Tubbs led the police to her daughter’s bedroom,

Costello went inside the room.     Tubbs' daughter was sleeping in

the room at that time.    The closet door was partially open.

Costello opened the door the rest of the way and observed a pile

of clothes in the bottom of the closet.      Because of the clothes,

the bag was not immediately visible in the closet even after the

closet door was fully opened.     Costello moved some clothes and

found the bag.   The drawstring was pulled closed when he

discovered it.   Before Costello picked up the bag he did not make

any determinations about what was inside of the bag and could not

discern anything about the contents of the bag from visible

observation alone.

     When Costello picked up the bag he observed that it was

heavy.   At this point, Costello still could not make any

determination regarding what the bag contained.        He proceeded to

feel the outside of the bag.     Based on this external touching,

Costello believed a firearm was inside.      He opened the bag and

saw a firearm, a magazine that had sixteen live rounds of

ammunition in it, and a baseball batting glove inside.         Costello

then handed the entire bag to Officer Hilliard, who secured the

items.   The police also showed Tubbs the contents of the bag and

told her the firearm was a machine gun.      Upon learning this,

Tubbs was extremely surprised and started shaking and crying.

She expressed concern for the safety of her children as a result

of the firearm being in the closet.

                                   6
        Case 1:06-cr-10339-DPW Document 72 Filed 04/04/08 Page 7 of 34



     Childs was informed of the gun’s discovery while in custody.

Upon hearing the news, Childs became visibly upset and began to

breathe rapidly.      He then asked for water and was provided a

glass by Smith.

D.   The July 5, 2006 Arrest

     Less than two weeks later, on July 5, 2006, Childs was

arrested in Brockton in an unrelated incident after police

responded to a report of domestic violence occurring at 42 Ford

Street.

     At approximately three o’clock in the morning Officer

Richard Gaucher arrived at 42 Ford Street and saw a man and a

woman standing in the driveway in the midst of a heated argument.

Officer James Baroud followed shortly thereafter.           When the man

saw that police had arrived, he ran onto a side porch, leaned

forward, and bent just out of sight.         Shortly thereafter, the man

returned to the driveway.       Gaucher identified the man as Childs.

Gaucher proceeded to engage Childs in conversation.           Gaucher

observed him to be very nervous and acted “like he was going to

run.”    His hands were also shaking and he was sweating.          Gaucher

proceeded to take Childs into custody for investigative purposes

and handcuffed him.

     Gaucher then spoke with the woman.         Visibly upset, the woman

said she was trying to avoid getting Childs into trouble and just

got nervous when “a man that size pushes her around.”            Baroud



                                      7
     Case 1:06-cr-10339-DPW Document 72 Filed 04/04/08 Page 8 of 34



checked for warrants on Childs and discovered he was the subject

of an active arrest warrant.

     Gaucher then went to the area of the porch where he saw

Childs lean over.    He discovered eight pieces of crack cocaine on

top of a trash bag.    Gaucher then told Childs, who was standing

with Baroud in the driveway, that he was going to be placed under

arrest.    Gaucher also informed Childs of the charges for the

outstanding warrant, for domestic violence, and for crack

cocaine.    Childs was then escorted into a police cruiser and

Gaucher read him his Miranda rights from a Miranda card.          While

Childs repeatedly asked questions about what he was charged with,

he also said he understood his Miranda rights.

     After his arrest, Childs was taken to the Brockton police

department.    On the way to the station, Gaucher noticed Childs

“fidgeting and moving like he was trying to hide something.”

Childs was handcuffed at the time, but Gaucher believed he was

trying to tuck or hide something in his pants.        Gaucher asked him

to stop moving.    After arriving at the station, Gaucher escorted

Childs out of the cruiser.    Gaucher observed Childs reach for his

rear anal region on several occasions.      When questioned, Childs

denied that he was hiding anything in his pants.        The two

officers then proceeded to strip search Childs and his anal

cavity area.    Officer Gaucher subsequently discovered and removed

two plastic baggies from that area.      One baggie appeared to


                                   8
      Case 1:06-cr-10339-DPW Document 72 Filed 04/04/08 Page 9 of 34



contain marijuana and the other had what appeared to be cocaine

and pieces of crack cocaine in it.       Following the police

discovery of the baggies, Captain Nordeen read Childs his Miranda

rights again.

     At that point, Childs became very upset.        Childs stated he

was on probation and could not do a “two year mandatory”

sentence.    He also pled with the officers to “make it go away.”

Gaucher told Childs he had an open case and his “best chance is

to work with Detective Smith,” the officer who arrested him on

the firearm charge.    Additionally, Gaucher suggested that Smith

might be able to “work out a deal with him.”        Childs responded he

was not worried about the gun case because “his boy was going to

take the rap for him on that.”      Gaucher then asked who Childs’

boy was.    Childs refused to answer the question.

     After the baggies were discovered, Childs told the police

that he had ADHD and he was bipolar.       Gaucher viewed those

statements as simply a ploy for sympathy.        Gaucher also concluded

that Childs understood all of the conversations with police

officers throughout the course of the night.        Gaucher testified

that Childs conversed with police for forty-five minutes in total

that night and was “competent.”

                       II.    CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

A.   Suppression of the Fruits of the June 29, 2006 Arrest

     1.    The Traffic Stop


                                    9
     Case 1:06-cr-10339-DPW Document 72 Filed 04/04/08 Page 10 of 34



     Childs contends that the search, seizure, and arrest

following the June 29, 2006 traffic stop should be suppressed

because the traffic stop was unreasonable.       He further asserts

that the illegality of the stop tainted all related evidence

recovered by the police thereafter.

     a.   Fourth Amendment Standards for Traffic Stops

     Generally, the police may lawfully stop a vehicle if they

“have probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has

occurred.”   Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 810 (1996).

Alternatively, the police may make an investigative vehicle stop

as long as the stop is justified by “a reasonable and articulable

suspicion of criminal activity.” United States v. Chhien, 266

F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2001).     Reasonable suspicion is measured by

balancing “the nature and quality of the intrusion on personal

security against the importance of the governmental interests

alleged to justify the intrusion.” United States v. Hensley, 469

U.S. 221, 228 (1985).    Because reasonable suspicion “defies

precise definition[, i]ts existence must be determined case by

case, and that determination entails broad-based consideration of

all the attendant circumstances.”       United States v. Chhien, 266

F.3d at 6.

     Police are also granted flexibility in their responses and

actions during a traffic stop.     The reasonableness of an

officer’s actions after a stop will be evaluated on the basis of


                                   10
     Case 1:06-cr-10339-DPW Document 72 Filed 04/04/08 Page 11 of 34



the circumstances that led to the stop in the first place and

also on information the officer learns as the stop progresses.

United States v. Sowers, 136 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir. 1998).          Thus,

“while an officer’s actions must bear some relation to the

purpose of the original stop, he may shift his focus and increase

the scope of the investigation by degrees if his suspicions mount

during the course of the detention.”      United States v. Chhein,

266 F.3d at 6.

     b.    Childs’ Argument

     Childs’ contends that Brockton police stopped the Mercedes

in order to arrest Childs and search for the gun, not because of

a Massachusetts motor vehicle law violation.        To support this

position, Childs claims that the police conduct that followed the

stop far exceeded that which would have been permitted by the

putative cause of the stop.     Specifically, after the Mercedes was

stopped three police cars blocked the car and six to eight police

officers approached the vehicle, half of them with their guns

drawn.

     I find Childs’ argument unpersuasive.       Based on the

undisputed testimony of Officer Matukas, I conclude that a

violation of Massachusetts motor vehicle laws occurred when the

Mercedes crossed the double yellow line on two separate

occasions.   This violation was sufficient for police to stop the

vehicle.   United States v. Chhien, 266 F.3d at 6 (explaining


                                   11
     Case 1:06-cr-10339-DPW Document 72 Filed 04/04/08 Page 12 of 34



police “clearly had cause to stop the [car] for tailgating and

operating an automobile equipped with blue-tinted lights”);

United States v. Soares, 451 F.Supp.2d 282, 287 (D. Mass. 2006)

(holding a police stop of a car was valid because the car was

driving without headlights and had either a dysfunctional

taillight or brake light); United States v. Starks, 301 F.Supp.2d

76, 81-82 (D. Mass. 2004) (holding police had probable cause to

stop a car because the rear license plate was not illuminated).

     The arrest and search of the car following the initial stop

were also appropriate based on Childs' and Brewer’s actions.

After stopping the car, the police repeatedly instructed Childs

and Brewer to show their hands but the men did not do so.

Additionally, the police observed Childs throw a bag of suspected

contraband into the backseat as they approached the vehicle.

Based upon all of the evidence, I find that post-stop-conduct by

Childs and Brewer justified their subsequent arrests and the

search of the vehicle.    Even if the police had initially pulled

the car over for a traffic violation and were merely suspicious

that the car might contain Childs’ bag, the subsequent actions of

the passengers within the car allowed the officers to increase

the scope of the investigation.

     While I conclude the stop, search, and arrest do not

constitute a Fourth Amendment violation, I note two aspects of

the police actions suggest a broader investigative purpose than


                                   12
     Case 1:06-cr-10339-DPW Document 72 Filed 04/04/08 Page 13 of 34



traffic control at the outset.     First, the number of cars and

officers present at the stop appears to be disproportionate to

the task of stopping the vehicle.       Of course, because the police

knew that Childs was in the car and that he might be carrying a

firearm, the number of officers and cars involved in the stop can

be viewed as a safety precaution in the case of potential

violence.    Thus, the manner in which the number of cars and

officers were used may have been intimidating, but not

unnecessarily overbearing nor improper.       Second, Officer

Hilliard’s testimony regarding the inevitability of the stop of

the Mercedes and arrest of Childs does suggest that the stated

reason for stopping the Mercedes may have been pretextual.             At

the suppression hearing Hilliard testified: “[W]e did

surveillance on that vehicle, the white Mercedes.         We were going

to take him away from [34 Coburn Street] for obvious reasons.               At

some point, he was going to be stopped and arrested.”         (emphasis

added).   While this testimony demonstrates the subjective intent

of the police, ultimately that is immaterial.        As an objective

matter, the operation of the car did violate the law and thus the

police had a proper basis for stopping the car.        Therefore, I

will deny Childs’ motion to suppress the fruits of the stop.

B.   Suppression of Items Obtained at 34 Coburn Street

     1.     Identifying the Proper Issue

     The Government contends that Tubbs had authority to consent


                                   13
        Case 1:06-cr-10339-DPW Document 72 Filed 04/04/08 Page 14 of 34



to a search of her apartment at 34 Coburn Street generally.               The

Government is correct in this regard.          Childs did not have a

reasonable expectation of privacy in the entire apartment.                Tubbs

had the authority to allow the police to search the apartment

because she at a minimum had common authority over the entire

area.    See United States v. Matlock, 415 U.S. 164, 170 (1974)

(explaining “the consent of one who possesses common authority

over premises or effects is valid as against the absent,

nonconsenting person with whom that authority is shared”).

     However, the central issue here is whether Childs had a

reasonable expectation of privacy in the bag that was kept in

Tubbs’ home, not whether Childs had a reasonable expectation of

privacy in the apartment generally.         See United States v.

Rodriguez, 888 F.2d 519, 523-24 (7th Cir. 1989) (explaining the

relevant inquiry was not whether the third party had authority to

consent to a search of a room, but whether the third party had

authority to consent to a search of containers within the room);

United States v. Davis, 332 F.3d 1163, 1167 (9th Cir. 2003)

(explaining that “the question before us is not whether

[defendant] had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the

contents of the apartment generally, but whether he could

reasonably believe that the contents of his gym bag [located

within the apartment] would remain private”); United States v.

Smairat, 503 F.Supp.2d 973, 987 (N.D. Ill. 2007) (“Courts must


                                      14
     Case 1:06-cr-10339-DPW Document 72 Filed 04/04/08 Page 15 of 34



independently consider whether a third party has the authority to

consent to a search of a residence and whether the third party

has authority to consent to particular containers within that

residence.”).

     With the proper issue in focus, I turn to the relevant law

and facts to determine if the search of the bag was proper.

     2.   Childs’ Expectation of Privacy in the Bag

     In order for Childs to establish standing to contest a

search or seizure on Fourth Amendment grounds, he must establish

that he has a legitimate and reasonable expectation of privacy in

the relevant object.    United States v. Dunning, 312 F.3d 528, 531

(1st Cir. 2002) (per curiam).     The Supreme Court has established

a two prong test in order to determine whether a legitimate

expectation of privacy exists.     Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735,

740 (1979).   The first prong asks whether the individual

exhibited an actual, subjective expectation of privacy; the

second prong asks whether that subjective expectation can be

recognized as reasonable by society.      Id.

     The First Circuit has identified several relevant factors

for determining whether a defendant had a reasonable expectation

of privacy in an item or place:

     [O]wnership, possession, and/or control; historical use of
     the property searched or the thing seized; ability to
     regulate access; the totality of the surrounding
     circumstances; the existence or nonexistence of a subjective
     anticipation of privacy; and the objective reasonableness of
     such an expectancy under the facts of a given case.

United States v. Sanchez, 943 F.2d 110, 113 (1st Cir. 1991)

(quoting United States v. Aguirre, 839 F.2d 854, 856-57 (1st Cir.

1998)).   The burden of establishing a reasonable expectation of

privacy is on the defendant.     United States v. Dunning, 312 F.3d

at 531.

     a.     Childs’ Subjective Expectation of Privacy

     Determining Childs’ subjective expectation of privacy must

be based on circumstantial evidence; he chose not to testify at

the suppression hearing.    There are several pieces of relevant

evidence.   Childs did not inform Tubbs of the content of the bag

or expressly authorize her to look in the bag.        From this, an

inference can be drawn that “he sought to preserve the contents

of his [] bag as private.”     United States v. Waller, 426 F.3d

838, 844 (6th Cir. 2005).     Childs also apparently owned the bag

and Tubbs identified the bag as Childs’ possession.         Both of

these facts indicate that he had a subjective expectation of

privacy in the bag.

     Childs also left the closed bag in a bedroom closet.4             By

closing the bag and putting it in a place away from plain view,

Childs “manifest[s] an expectation that the contents would remain

free from public examination.”     United States v. Waller, 426 F.3d


     4
     He may also have covered the bag with clothes. The police
found the bag underneath a pile of clothes in the closet.
Testimony did not indicate whether Childs covered the bag himself
or the clothes had been put there by another member of the Tubbs’
household.

                                   16
     Case 1:06-cr-10339-DPW Document 72 Filed 04/04/08 Page 17 of 34



at 844 (determining that defendant had a subjective expectation

of privacy in part because he “left [a] bag zipped, closed, and

stored in the bedroom closet of the apartment”); see also United

States v. Haydel, 649 F.2d 1152, 1154-55 (5th Cir. 1981) (finding

defendant had reasonable expectation of privacy in gambling

records stored under his parents’ bed, even though “he did not

reside regularly at his parents’ home, he kept clothing there and

had occasionally remained overnight”); United States v. Davis,

332 F.3d at 1168 (concluding defendant had reasonable expectation

of privacy in the items in his gym bag which he “stored under the

bed in an apartment where he sleeps and keeps his belongings”).

Based on the totality of circumstances, I find that Childs

“demonstrate[d] that he sought to preserve the contents of the

[effects] as private” and thus established a subjective

expectation of privacy.     United States v. Yang, 478 F.3d 832, 835

(7th Cir. 2007).

     b.      The Reasonableness of Childs’ Expectation of Privacy

         “[A] person generally has an expectation of privacy in

items he places in a closed container.”5       United States v. Meada,


     5
      While the First Circuit has made clear that a person has an
expectation of privacy in containers, there are exceptions to
this general rule. Specifically, containers that “so betray
their contents . . . abrogate any such expectation.” United
States v. Meada, 408 F.3d 14, 23 (1st Cir. 2005). “The contents
of [these types of] containers are treated as being in plain
view.” Id. “[S]ome containers (for example a kit of burglar
tools or a gun case) by their very nature cannot support any
reasonable expectation of privacy because their contents can be

                                   17
        Case 1:06-cr-10339-DPW Document 72 Filed 04/04/08 Page 18 of 34



408 F.3d 14, 23 (1st Cir. 2005).           “A person does not forfeit that

expectation of privacy merely because the container is located in

a place that is not controlled exclusively by the container’s

owner.”       United States v. Fultz, 146 F.3d 1102, 1105 (9th Cir.

1998); see also United States v. Botchway, 433 F.Supp.2d 163, 170

(D. Mass. 2006).

        Generally, the idea that a person has a expectation of

privacy in a closed, personal container left in another person’s

home with permission of the permanent resident is reasonable.6

United States v. Waller, 426 F.3d at 844; see also United States

v. Davis, 332 F.3d at 1168; United States v. Fultz, 146 F.3d at

1105.       For example, in United States v. Infante-Ruiz, 13 F.3d

498, 501 (1st Cir. 1994), the defendant left an unlocked

briefcase in the trunk of a car for “a period of some days” and



inferred form their outward appearance.” Arkansas v. Sanders,
442 U.S. 753, 765 n.13 (1979). Additionally, “in some cases the
contents of a package will be open to ‘plain view,’ thereby
obviating the need for a warrant.” Id.
     The bag at issue does not fit within this exception. It was
a black Nike pull-string bag. There is no evidence that suggests
the bag had special markings or any other indicia to indicate it
contained a firearm. Moreover, the bag was closed. Costello
testified that he could not make any determinations about what
was inside of the bag and could not discern anything about the
contents of the bag from visible observation alone. Thus, the
bag was different from burglar tools or a gun case and does not
fit into any recognized exception.
        6
      As noted, Note 3, supra, Tubbs’ testimony regarding Childs,
the bag, and the apartment is, in certain particulars, somewhat
inconsistent. However, Tubbs consistently stated that the bag
was in her daughter’s bedroom closet with her permission.

                                      18
      Case 1:06-cr-10339-DPW Document 72 Filed 04/04/08 Page 19 of 34



allowed “others to place possessions of their own inside it.”

Id.   Nevertheless, the First Circuit concluded that he had a

legitimate expectation of privacy in the briefcase because his

actions “did not reveal a willingness . . . to ‘expose’ such

items to the public.”     Id.   The court also found it illuminating

that a third party “indentifi[ed] . . . the briefcase as

belonging to [defendant].”      Id.    The fact that others were

allowed access to the unlocked briefcase and felt “entitled to

place items of their own within it” did not change the First

Circuit’s analysis.     Id. at 501.        Because the defendant had not

“abandoned the briefcase, relinquished authority over it, or left

it open to public inspection and consumption,” he maintained a

reasonable expectation of privacy over the briefcase.           Id.

(internal quotations omitted).

      In this case, Childs did not permit Tubbs to put her own

possessions in his bag or relinquish authority over the bag in

any other way.    Similarly, despite the Government’s claims to the

contrary, the evidence does not suggest that Childs abandoned the

bag at Tubbs' home.7    Thus, I find Childs’ expectation of privacy

was one that society would deem reasonable.

      3.   Tubbs’ Common Authority Over the Bag

      The next relevant issue is whether Tubbs had authority to



      7
       Abandonment is discussed below in Part II, Section B(4)(b).


                                      19
     Case 1:06-cr-10339-DPW Document 72 Filed 04/04/08 Page 20 of 34



consent to the search of the bag.       The Government bears the

burden of establishing the validity of a third party’s consent

when a warrantless search is conducted.       Illinois v. Rodriguez,

497 U.S. 177, 181 (1990).     To carry its burden, the Government

must establish that Tubbs had either actual or apparent authority

to consent.   United States v. Botchway, 433 F.Supp.2d at 171.

     a.   Actual Authority

     When the Government seeks to justify a warrantless search by

proof of third-party consent, it “may show that permission to

search was obtained from a third party who possessed common

authority over or other sufficient relationship to the premises

or effects sought to be inspected.”       United States v. Matlock,

415 U.S. at 171.   Common authority, in turn, rests “on mutual use

of the property by persons generally having joint access or

control for most purposes.”     Id. at n.7.    However, “ownership and

control of property does not automatically confer authority over

containers within it.”    United States v. Salinas-Cano, 959 F.2d

861, 865 (10th Cir. 1992).

     In this case, the pertinent inquiry is whether Tubbs had

mutual use of and joint access to the bag.       This case is similar

to United States v. Botchway, where Judge Saylor found that a

third party lacked actual authority to consent to a search of

defendant’s locked, soft-sided briefcase that was in the trunk of

a car the third party was riding in.       The third party in Botchway


                                   20
     Case 1:06-cr-10339-DPW Document 72 Filed 04/04/08 Page 21 of 34



lacked authority because “the briefcase and its contents belonged

to [the defendant],” there was “no evidence that [the defendant]

shared access or control over the briefcase with any other

person,” and the defendant “did not abandon the briefcase,

entrust it to another, or otherwise relinquish authority over it

in any respect.”    Id. at 170.

     Analogously, in this case, the bag belonged to Childs, there

was no evidence he shared control of the bag with Tubbs8, and

Childs did not abandon the briefcase, entrust it to another, or

otherwise relinquish authority over it.9       These facts satisfy me

that Tubbs lacked actual authority to consent to the search.

United States v. Waller, 426 F.3d at 845-46.        Additionally, Tubbs

did not know what Childs kept in the bag, ask him what he kept in

the bag, or take any other affirmative steps to determine the

contents of the bag.    When pressed by my questioning, Tubbs

suggested that she thought she had authority to look in the bag

if she wanted to.   I find this post-hoc assertion of authority to

be unpersuasive in light of her earlier testimony.         When I

originally asked her the same question, she testified that she


     8
     Tubbs did, however, state that she saw Brewer with the bag.
However, this fact is not relevant to whether Tubbs possessed
actual authority over the bag.
     9
     I again note that in her testimony Tubbs said that she saw
Brewer with the bag on one other occasion. However, this remark
was not developed during the evidentiary hearing and I cannot
conclude on this basis alone that Childs relinquished meaningful
control over the bag to another person.

                                   21
     Case 1:06-cr-10339-DPW Document 72 Filed 04/04/08 Page 22 of 34



thought she had the right to look in the bag because “had [she]

looked in it, we probably wouldn’t be here today.”

     This case also bears resemblances to a situation Justice

O’Connor described in United States v. Karo, 468 U.S. 705, 726

(1984) (O’Connor, J., concurring).       She observed that when a

“guest in a private home has a private container to which the

homeowner has no right of access[, t]he homeowner who permits

entry into his home of such a container effectively surrenders a

segment of the privacy of his home to the privacy of the owner of

the container.”   Id.    In these situations, “the homeowner . . .

lacks the power to give effective consent to the search of the

closed container.”      Id.   While her testimony was not entirely

consistent regarding Childs and the bag, Tubbs did consistently

state that she gave Childs permission to store his bag in her

daughter’s closet.   This too suggests that Tubbs did not have

joint access to or mutual use of the bag.       Because Tubbs did not

have mutual use of or joint access to the bag for most purposes,

she lacked actual authority to consent to the search.

     b.   Apparent Authority

     In the absence of actual authority, a third party’s consent

to search is valid if “the facts available to the officer at the

moment . . . warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief

that the consenting party had [actual] authority over the

premises” or objects.      Illinois v. Rodriguez, 497 U.S. at 188.


                                    22
     Case 1:06-cr-10339-DPW Document 72 Filed 04/04/08 Page 23 of 34



However, “[w]here the circumstances presented would cause a

person of reasonable caution to question whether the third party

has mutual use of the property, ‘warrantless entry without

further inquiry is unlawful[.]’” United States v. Waller, 426

F.3d at 846 (quoting Illinois v. Rodriguez, 497 U.S. at 188-89)).

When determining whether a third party had apparent authority to

consent to the search, a court must assess the “totality of the

circumstances.”      United States v. Meada, 408 F.3d at 22.

     Botchway is also instructive in this context.         There Judge

Saylor concluded that the third party also lacked apparent

authority over the briefcase.     He found that no reasonable

inference of authority could be made because the police officer

“did not ask, and was not told, to whom the briefcase belonged.”

United States v. Botchway, 433 F.Supp.2d at 171.        The police

officer merely concluded that the “[third party] had authority

over its contents, notwithstanding the fact that the briefcase

bore no identification and the car contained two other

passengers.”   Id.    Put simply, “[a]t the point that [the police

officer] picked up the briefcase and unzipped it, he had no

reasonable basis for concluding that it belonged to [the

consenting party].”      Id.

     Just as in Botchway, when Costello found the bag he had no

reasonable basis for believing that Tubbs had joint access to or

common authority over it.      The police went to 34 Coburn Street


                                   23
      Case 1:06-cr-10339-DPW Document 72 Filed 04/04/08 Page 24 of 34



for the purpose of searching for Childs’ black bag.          After they

arrived at the apartment, Tubbs informed the officers that Childs

kept a black bag in the apartment.        While Tubbs clearly indicated

that she lived in the apartment, she did not disclose any facts

that would support a reasonable belief by the police that she had

apparent authority over the bag.         She never indicated that the

bag was hers or that she knew what the contents of the bag were.

In fact, Tubbs’ reaction when learning the contents of the bag

strongly suggests that she did not previously know what was in

it.   The police did not ask her any questions to determine her

relationship with the bag.      Based on the information available to

them, it was entirely unclear whether Tubbs had access or control

over the bag.    In uncertain situations, police may not simply

assume that a third party has authority over an item, but rather

must conduct sufficient inquiry to determine if authority exists

or not.   See, e.g., United States v. Kimoana, 383 F.3d 1215, 1222

(10th Cir. 2004) (“[W]here an officer is presented with ambiguous

facts related to authority, he or she has a duty to investigate

further before relying on the consent”); United States v. McCoy,

1999 WL 357749, at *10 (6th Cir. May 12, 1999) (“If the [police]

do not learn enough, if the circumstances make it unclear whether

the property about to be searched is subject to mutual use by the

person giving consent, then warrantless entry is unlawful without

further inquiry”); United States v. Waller, 426 F.3d at 847.


                                    24
     Case 1:06-cr-10339-DPW Document 72 Filed 04/04/08 Page 25 of 34



Consequently, the Government has not met its burden for

establishing that Tubbs had apparent authority to consent to the

search.

     4.    Other Justifications

     The Government alternatively contends that the search of the

bag was justified on other grounds.

     a.    The Plain Feel Doctrine

     The Government suggested that the search did not violate the

Fourth Amendment because Costello’s manipulation of the outside

of the bag before opening it fell within the scope of the plain

feel exception.   The plain feel exception has its roots in Terry

v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), in which the Supreme Court held that

a police officer may conduct a pat-down or frisk search of an

suspicious individual believed to be armed and presently

dangerous.   Id. at 24.   In Terry, the Court limited the

applicability of pat-downs and frisks to those instances in which

the police can justifiably stop and detain persons reasonably

suspected of possible criminal behavior.       Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S.

at 22.    In addition, the scope of a Terry protective search is

centered around the safety of the officer or others in the area.

That is, pat-downs and frisks are only permissible when “a

reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in

the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger.”           392

U.S. at 27; see also Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032, 1049


                                   25
     Case 1:06-cr-10339-DPW Document 72 Filed 04/04/08 Page 26 of 34



(1983); Ybarra v. Illinois, 444 U.S. 85, 92-93 (1979); Adams v.

Williams, 407 U.S. 143, 146 (1972).

     I do not find Terry applicable to the search at 34 Coburn

Street.   Terry searches involve the forcible stop and limited

search of persons based upon a reasonable suspicion of criminal

behavior when no probable cause exists.       See United States v.

Dickerson, 508 U.S. at 373; Place, 462 U.S. at 703.         Terry

however has not been extended to pat-downs of containers in

warrantless searches such as the one at issue here.         The

Government cites Dickerson to support its contention that police

can conduct a pat-down of a container and seize it if its

contents are revealed to be contraband, but Dickerson does not

stand for this proposition.     Rather, in that case the Supreme

Court suggested that pat-down searches of individuals would be

permissible if “a police officer lawfully pats down a suspect’s

outer clothing and feels an object whose contour or mass makes

its identity immediately apparent.”      United States v. Dickerson,

508 U.S. at 377.

     The Government suggests that when police have reasonable

suspicion that personal effects contain contraband the Fourth

Amendment allows for a seizure and Terry-frisk of the property.

While the Court has recognized that exigency may require a

seizure of a container if probable cause exists as to its

contents, the seizure is only permitted “pending issuance of a

                                   26
     Case 1:06-cr-10339-DPW Document 72 Filed 04/04/08 Page 27 of 34



warrant to examine its contents.” Place, 462 U.S. at 701.          The

Fourth Amendment does not necessarily permit a pat-down search of

a container just because the search is based on reasonable

suspicion.10   Even if such a pat-down search was permissible,

there is no evidence that the police conducted the search because

the bag presented a specific danger to their safety which is a

prerequisite to conducting a Terry pat frisk to begin with.

Moreover, the bag was far removed from Childs’ presence when the

police felt the exterior of it.

     The Government’s reliance or probable cause based on the

information from the CI serves to emphasize the fact that the

police had the time and information to seek out a warrant, rather

than conduct a warrantless search.      No attempt to secure a

warrant was ever made.    Therefore, I conclude that the plain feel

exception does not justify the search of the bag conducted by the

police during the search of Tubbs’ apartment.



     10
      Courts within the First Circuit have apparently not
extended the plain feel doctrine such that pat downs of closed
containers are permissible. Research has disclosed only one case
that involved the application of the plain feel doctrine in a
situation other than a pat-down of the body of a suspect. See
United States v. Robinson, 999 F. Supp. 155, 161 (D. Mass. 1998).
In that case, the defendant moved to suppress a semi-automatic
weapon that police found wrapped in a towel on a windowsill while
conducting a warrantless search. However, Judge Keeton expressly
distinguished this situation from those involving closed
containers. Id. (explaining “[w]rappping something in a towel,
or hiding it behind a window shade for that matter, do not
implicate the heightened expectation of privacy that is
associated with closed containers”).

                                   27
     Case 1:06-cr-10339-DPW Document 72 Filed 04/04/08 Page 28 of 34



     b.    Abandonment

     The Government separately argues that Childs abandoned the

bag when he left 34 Coburn Street on the night of June 29, 2006.

It is true that the warrant requirement does not normally apply

to searches of abandoned containers.      Abel v. United States, 362

U.S. 217, 240-41 (1960).     However, I find as a matter of fact

that Childs did not abandon his bag.      When Tubbs was directly

questioned about whether she believed Childs had abandoned the

bag by leaving the apartment without it, she clearly indicated

that he did not.   Other evidence also suggests that Childs did

not abandon the bag.     When Childs first walked into Tubbs’

apartment at 7:20 p.m. on the night of June 29, 2006, the police

did not observe either he or Brewer carrying the bag with him.

Thus, presumably Childs had left the bag at 34 Coburn Street at

some earlier point in time.     From this fact, the reasonable

inference to be drawn is that Childs did not abandon the bag

merely by leaving the apartment again at 9:20 p.m.

     The Government relies on United States v. Tolbert, 692 F.2d

1041 (6th Cir. 1982), to support its argument.        I find the case

to be inapplicable because there the defendant expressly

disclaimed ownership of narcotics-containing luggage.         Id. at

1044-45.   Here, Childs did not expressly disclaim ownership of

his black bag in any way.     Thus, I find that the record does not

support the proposition that Childs abandoned his bag.

     5.   Conclusion

     Because Childs has established that he had Fourth Amendment

standing and the Government did not show that the warrantless

search was justified, I conclude that the bag and its contents

must be suppressed.    I also conclude that any communications,

verbal or non-verbal, made by Childs after he learned that the

bag and firearm had been discovered by police at 34 Coburn Street

should be excluded.    The Defendant’s reactions, upon learning of

the firearm as described in Officer Smith’s police report, are

inadmissible because they followed and are tied to the illegal

search of the bag.    Under fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine,

“evidence obtained directly or indirectly from a violation of the

Fourth Amendment is not admissible against an accused at trial.”

United States v. Bienvenue, 632 F.2d 910, 913 (1st Cir. 1980)

(citing Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471 (1963)).          There

was no break in the chain of events sufficient to refute the

inference that Childs' communicative acts were a product of the

illegal search.   See United States v. Rivas, 157 F.3d 364, 368

(1998) (citing Brown v. Illinois, 422 U.S. 590, 602-03 (1975)).

Smith’s report states that Hilliard, who took part in the search

at 34 Coburn Street, called Smith, who then relayed the

information to Childs, who was present and in custody.         The

statements describing Childs’ reactions upon hearing the news

must be suppressed.

C.   Suppression of Childs’ Statements Following
     the July 5, 2006 Arrest

     The Defendant also seeks to suppress certain statements that

he made following his arrest on July 5, 2006, including

statements relating to the events of June 29, 2006.         Childs

contends suppression is appropriate because he was not informed

of his Miranda rights when he was first arrested and did not

waive his Miranda rights at the time of his arrest or after he

was taken to the police department.

     1.   Legal Standards

     An arrest involving custodial restraint and interrogation

requires warning the defendant of his Fifth Amendment rights

against self-incrimination.     United States v. Maguire, 918 F.2d

254, 261-62 (1st Cir. 1990). Under Miranda, interrogation

     refers not only to express questioning, but also to any
     words or actions on the part of the police . . . that the
     police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an
     incriminating response from the suspect. The latter portion
     of this definition focuses primarily upon the perceptions of
     the suspect, rather than the intent of the police. This
     focus reflects the fact that the Miranda safeguards were
     designed to vest a suspect in custody with an added measure
     of protection against coercive police practices, without
     regard to objective proof of the underlying intent of the
     police.

Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 301 (1980).        The standard is

an objective one, but limited to “words or actions on the part of

police officers that they should have known were reasonably

likely to elicit an incriminating response.” Id. at 302 (emphasis

in original).

     A defendant may waive his Miranda rights, but only after he

was fully informed of those rights and the waiver is made

voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently.       Miranda v. Arizona,

384 U.S. 436, 444 (1966). The standard to determine whether a

statement is truly voluntary and not coerced has two prongs;

first, the waiver must have been a product of a free and

deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or

deception, and second, the waiver must be accompanied with a full

awareness of the nature of the right being abandoned and the

consequences of that abandonment. Colorado v. Spring, 479 U.S.

564, 573 (1987) (citing Moran v. Burbine, 475 U.S. 412, 421

(1986)).   The burden is on the Government to prove, by a

preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant waived his

Miranda rights.   Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157, 168 (1986).

     2.    Informing Childs of Miranda Rights After He
           Was Arrested

     The record satisfies me that Childs did receive Miranda

warnings following his arrest at 42 Ford Street.        Officer Gaucher

testified that he read Childs his Miranda rights following his

arrest and after Childs had been placed in a police cruiser.

This testimony comports with Gaucher’s report from the night of

July 5, 2006.   Childs offered nothing to establish the contrary.

Therefore, I conclude that he did receive his Miranda rights upon

his arrest outside of 42 Ford Street.

     3.    Childs’ Specific Post-Arrest Statements

     a.   “Make it go away” and Related Statements

     After the baggies on Childs’ body were discovered at the

police station, Childs pleaded with the police to “make it go

away” and stated that he was on probation and could not do a two-

year mandatory sentence.    I find these statements to have been

made voluntarily and not as a result of police interrogation.

The evidence shows that Childs made this first series of

statements directly following the discovery of narcotics in his

anal cavity.    While Childs was confronted with the narcotics by

this discovery, “[c]onfrontation with incriminating evidence does

not amount to coercion.”    Johnson v. Hall, 605 F.2d 577, 582 (1st

Cir. 1979).    After discovering the baggies of contraband, the

police did not ask Childs any questions or make any other

statements to him.    Rather, Childs spontaneously reacted to their

discovery.    Thus, these statements are properly viewed as

voluntary and not in response to any interrogation.         Therefore,

these statements are admissible.



     b.   “His boy was going to take the rap” Statement

     Following Childs’ plea for leniency, Gaucher told Childs

that he had an open case and that his “best chance is to work

with Detective Smith.”    Gaucher added that Childs might be able

to “work out a deal with [Smith].”      In response, Childs said he

was not worried about the gun case because “his boy was going to



                                   32
     Case 1:06-cr-10339-DPW Document 72 Filed 04/04/08 Page 33 of 34



take the rap for him on that.”

     I find that Officer Gaucher’s words constituted an

interrogation.   Specifically, Gaucher’s reference to Officer

Smith, Childs’ arresting officer for the earlier firearms charge

and an officer who was not involved in the July 5, 2006 arrest,

was a gratuitous statement made unrelated to the arrest and

custody.   See United States v. Reyes, 434 F.Supp.2d 58, 66 (D.

Mass. 2006) (statements made by defendant in response to agents’

superfluous questioning not normally attendant to arrest and

custody were suppressed).     This reference to the prior firearm

incident, unrelated to the issue at hand, and its potential for

providing an avenue to more favorable treatment, was reasonably

likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.

     That is not the end of the inquiry.       Childs’ statements

could still be admissible if the Government can prove that Childs

adequately waived his Miranda rights.       However, the Government

has not met its burden in this regard.       The record does not

indicate that the officers sought or Childs gave an express oral

or written waiver of his Miranda rights in connection with this

aspect of the interrogation.     It is true that an explicit waiver

is not always necessary to support a finding that the defendant

waived his Miranda rights.     See North Carolina v. Butler, 441

U.S. 369, 375-76 (1979).    However, the only evidence the

Government offers to show Childs voluntarily waived his Miranda


                                   33
     Case 1:06-cr-10339-DPW Document 72 Filed 04/04/08 Page 34 of 34



rights is his past history as a criminal defendant.         According to

the Government, Childs was familiar with the scope of his

constitutional rights based on past encounters with law

enforcement.   I find that the Government has not introduced

enough evidence to validate the presence of the Moran factors in

this case at the time the interrogation turned to the firearms

violation.   Thus, I will suppress this portion of Childs’ post-

arrest statements dealing with the firearm and “his boy” made to

the Brockton police at a time when the record establishes that he

did not knowingly waive his rights with respect to the firearm

charges.

III. CONCLUSION

     For the foregoing reasons, I GRANT in part and DENY in part

Childs’ motion to suppress.
