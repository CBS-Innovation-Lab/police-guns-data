The defendants extraordinary demonstration of rehabilitation in the period between the commission of the instant offense

is sufficient but not more severe than necessary to serve the purposes of § 3553.

STATEMENT OF REASONS

VII COURT DETERMINAT|ONS OF REST|TUTION
A m Restitution Not Applicable.

B Total Amount of Restitution:
C Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

l [:I For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

2 [:I For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
issues ol`fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that thc need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(B).
3 jj For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh

the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(l)(B)(ii).

4 I:I Rcstitution is not ordered for other rcasons. (Explain.)
