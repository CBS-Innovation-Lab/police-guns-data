NO. 06-1808
UNITED STATES,
Appellee,
v.
K_ENYATTA ELIJAH JAHK`UR,

Defendant, Appellant.

 

Before

Boudin, Chief Judge,
Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.

 

JUDGMENT
Entered: August 7, 2007

Appellant pled guilty to a charge of being a felon in
possession of a firearm, but he reserved the right to appeal the
district court's denial of his motion to suppress the firearm
evidence. Appellant contends that he did not consent to the pat-
down that led to the discovery of two weapons on his person.

The district court held a suppression hearing at which the
police officer who had conducted the pat-down was the only witness.
Appellant submitted an affidavit to the court but declined to
lr_testify at the hearing.

The court correctly placed the burden on the government to
prove consent fur a preponderance of the evidence. The court
properly examined the totality of the circumstances. United States
v. Marshall, 348 F.3d 281, 286 (1st Cir. 2003). It found that

appellant's conduct - asking the officer for a ride to his girl
friend's house and lifting his arms to the traditional search
position when asked if he had weapons on him - supported the

inference that he had consented to a pat-down. Under our

Case 1:05-cr-10076-N|\/|G Document 39 Filed 08/28/2007 Page 2 of 2

precedents consent need not be conveyed in words where the meaning
of gestures is clear. United States v. Zapata, 18 F.3d 971, 977
(1st Cir. 1994); United §tates v. Millerr 589 F.2d 1117, 1130*1131
(1st Cir. 1978). The factual determination that consent was given
is reviewed for clear error and we discern none. United States v.

Forbes, 181 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1999).

The government's motion for summary disposition is granted.
The judgment is affirmed. See 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).
