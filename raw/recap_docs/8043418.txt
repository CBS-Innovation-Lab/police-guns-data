       MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR DOWNWARD DEPARTURE


         William Williams, the Defendant in the above captioned matter, has moved this Court to
depart downward pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3(b)(1). Chapter Four of the United States Sentencing
Guidelines attempts to assess the seriousness of an individual’s criminal history in order to aptly
consider it in sentencing. U.S.S.G. §4, Introductory Commentary (2006). The chapter proclaims that
the criminal record directly relates to the purposes of punishment in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2).1 The
guideline, however, falls short of an accurate analysis when applied to individual cases. The
guideline assess’s points for convictions only based the length of sentence, with no regard to the
nature of the offense and surrounding facts. Further, it makes generalizations about prospective
rehabilitation and recidivism in relation to prior convictions which have little worth given the
Court’s mission to sentence individuals.
         Mr. Williams’s criminal record is significant in number of convictions, but otherwise not
nearly as serious as the guideline assessment makes it seem. Following to the guideline rules, Mr.



         1
          The statute provides, in pertinent part, that
“the court consider the need for the sentence imposed-
         (A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment
         for the offense;
         (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;
         (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and
         (D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other
         correctional treatment in the most effective manner;”
18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2) (2005).

Williams has a total of 13 criminal history points. Section 4A1.3(b)(1) states, in pertinent part:
       If reliable information indicates that the defendant's criminal history category substantially

       over-represents the seriousness of the defendant's criminal history or the likelihood that the
       defendant will commit other crimes, a downward departure may be warranted.

His three felony convictions all date back ten years ago. Since 1997 he has 8 misdemeanor
convictions which account for 6 criminal history points, but, although numerous, 5 of those cases
are driving offenses. Mr. Williams’s record clearly shows that he has made a determined effort to
stay out of serious trouble for the past 10 years. The guidelines do not account for the disparity
between Mr. Williams’s very serious crimes of 1996, and the more mundane misdemeanor offenses
he has acquired since. For these reasons a downward departure is appropriate to reflect the less
serious aspect of his criminal record.
