STATEN[ENT OF REASONS

VII COURT DETERM|NAT[ONS OF RESTITUTION
A w Restitution Not Applicable.

B Total Amount of Restitution:
C Restitution not ordered (Checlt only one.):

l [:l For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

2 [:l For offenses for which restitution is othenvise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex

issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims‘ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any vi;tim would bc outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(B).

3 m For other offenses for which rstitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
ordered because the conplication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting ii‘om the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh

the need to provide restitution to any victim under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(l)(B)(ii).

4 [:I Restitution is not ordered for other reasons (Explain.)

D i:l Partial restitution is ordered for these reasons (18 U.S.C. § 35 53(c)):
