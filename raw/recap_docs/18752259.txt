                 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                      DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America,
      Plaintiff

            v.                               CR. 05-156-01-SM

George Curran,
     Defendant

                                     ORDER


      Defendant Curran’s motion to continue the final pretrial conference and

trial is granted (document no. 8).    Defendant Curran has filed a Waiver of

Speedy Trial. Trial has been rescheduled for the month of January 2006.

      The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial,

18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would

unreasonably deny the defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances.
