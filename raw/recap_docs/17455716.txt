                   DEFENDANT


                ORDER ON DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO MODIFY
                        TERM OF IMPRISONMENT


      The defendant’s Motion to Modify Term of Imprisonment Pursuant to

Title 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) is DENIED. I sentenced this defendant on April 10,

2001. He argues that Sentencing Guideline Amendment 709, which took effect

on November 1, 2007, should alter his Criminal History and his Guideline

sentence.

      Section   3582(c)(2)   allows   resentencing    where   the   United    States

Sentencing Commission has lowered a guideline range “if such a reduction is

consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing

Commission.”     But the Commission’s applicable “policy statement” is USSG

1B1.10. It provides for retroactive effect for guideline amendments only if they

are specifically listed in USSG 1B1.10(c). Amendment 709 is not listed there.

Therefore, it is not retroactive and it does not help this defendant. Nothing in

United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), changes that outcome or makes

the statute and Policy Statement unconstitutional.         Booker does not apply
retroactively to sentences that are already final. Cirilo-Munoz v. United States,

404 F.3d 527, 532-33 (1st Cir. 2005). Booker also does not apply to sentence

reductions.   See United States v. Julien, 550 F. Supp. 2d 138, 140 (D. Me.

2008); United States v. Poland, 533 F. Supp. 2d 199, 207-08 (D. Me. 2008).

      SO ORDERED.

      DATED THIS 2ND DAY OF JUNE, 2010
