                           UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                                DISTRICT OF MAINE

  UNITED STATES OF AMERICA                        )

                         Defendant.               )


                  ORDER ON DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO VACATE


         Before the Court is Defendant’s Motion to Vacate (Docket # 123), in which

  Defendant asks the Court to vacate and reissue its Order of September 18, 2008, “so that

  an appeal can be taken therefrom.” Defendant states that the Clerk’s Office did not

  receive the Notice of Appeal that he drafted and mailed within ten days of entry of

  judgment.

         Because it may not reissue an order solely to permit the filing of a subsequent

  Notice of Appeal, the Court DENIES Defendant’s Motion to Vacate (Docket # 123). See

  United States v. Rapoport, 159 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1998). However, this ruling does not

  prevent Defendant from filing his Notice of Appeal along with a declaration or notarized

  statement asserting that his initial Notice was timely filed pursuant to the prisoner

  mailbox rule. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(c)(1) (submission must “set forth the date of deposit

  and state that first-class postage has been prepaid.”).

         SO ORDERED.

                                                            /s/ George Z. Singal
                                                            Chief U.S. District Judge

  Dated this 29th day of January, 2009.
