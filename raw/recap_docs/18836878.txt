                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 07-cr-116-PB

Steven Delaurier



                                  O R D E R



     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

October 10, 2007 trial in the above case, citing the need for

additional time to engage in plea negotiations or prepare for

trial.    The government does not object to a continuance of the

trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reasons and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from October 10, 2007 to January 8, 2008.             In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial
