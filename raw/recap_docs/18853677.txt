                    UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                         DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

            v.                                 Case No. 07-cr-8-01/02-SM

Melissa Allen
Michael Guinier


                                      ORDER



      Defendant Guinier's assented-to motion to continue the trial (document no. 53)

is granted. Trial has been rescheduled for the March 2008 trial period. Defendant shall

file a Waiver of Speedy Trial Rights not later than February 5, 2008. On the filing of

such waiver, her continuance shall be effective.

      The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance outweigh

the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ยง

3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would unreasonably deny the

defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective preparation taking into account
