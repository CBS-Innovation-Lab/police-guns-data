     in violation of Title 18, united States Code, section 1962(c).
                             MANNER AND MEANS 

           BY WHICH THE RACKETEERING CONSPIRACY WAS CARRIED OUT 

          3.   It was part of the manner and means of this conspiracy
     that defendant, ANTHONY J. CORSO, Michael P. Fosher, and others
     known and unknown to the Grand Jury, would and did plan and
     commit robberies and home invasions and carry away stolen money
     and goods to divide among themselves.
          4.   It was further part of the manner and means of this
     conspiracy that defendant, ANTHONY J. CORSO, Michael P. Fosher,
     and others known and unknown to the Grand Jury, would and did
     obtain and use threats of bodily harm, and exhibit firearms, to
     intimidate their victims and learn the whereabouts and
     combinations of safes and the whereabouts of other valuables.         In
     addition, they would and did use handcuffs, duct tape, "ties" and
     the like to restrain their victims While committing the robbery.
          5.   It was further part of the manner and means of this
     conspiracy that on occasion defendant, ANTHONY J. CORSO, Michael
     P. Fosher, and others known and unknown to the Grand Jury, would
     and did target the homes of persons dealing in controlled
     substances.   They targeted such persons so as to minimize the
     likelihood that their victims would report the robbery or testify
     against them in the event that charges were brought.         In
     addition, it was part of the manner and means of the conspiracy
     that defendant ANTHONY J. CORSO and Michael P. Fosher sought to
     steal controlled substances both for their own use and for
     distribution to others.

        6.     It was further part of the manner and means of this
conspiracy that defendant, ANTHONY J. CORSO, Michael P. Fosher,
and others known and unknown to the Grand Jury, would and did use
ruses to gain entry to homes and commit robberies.            Where they
believed that their victims were engaged in illegal activity,
they would obtain and use badges, firearms, and search warrants
and would impersonate law enforcement agents as a way of gaining
entry to the home; when demanding money or drugs, they would tell
the victims that they would be coming back with a police dog.
Where they did not believe that their victims were engaged in
illegal activity, they would purchase floral arrangements and
pose as florist delivery men as a way of gaining entry to the
home.
        7.     It was further part of the manner and means of this
conspiracy that defendant, ANTHONY J. CORSO, Michael P. Fosher,
and others known and unknown to the Grand Jury, would and did
corruptly endeavor to obstruct law enforcement investigations
into their criminal activities.

Defendant ANTHONY J. CORSO and Michael Chinn entered the home,
carrying a basket of carnations.
     18.   While defendant ANTHONY J. CORSO and Michael Chinn were
in the home, they bound the wrists of Patricia Hunt with "ties".
Because they had difficulty opening the floor safe in the garage
of Patricia Hunt's home, Michael P. Fosher and the person driving
the second vehicle entered the garage to help them.

defendant ANTHONY J. CORSO and Michael P. Fosher stole gold coins
worth $500,000, more or less.     In addition, defendant ANTHONY J.
CORSO stole jewelry worth 30,000, more or less.

within hearing of Patricia Hunt, to shoot her if she did not tell
him where the "other safe" was.
     21.   After the robbery, Michael P. Fosher arranged to melt
down some of the coins taken in the robbery in Florida.
Thereafter, Michael P. Fosher gave $30,000 in cash, more or less,

Building.    Defendant ANTHONY J. CORSO told the person known to
the Grand Jury that he wanted to be paid in cash.         The person

        Michael P. Fosher, and others known and unknown to the Grand
        Jury, would and did obtain and use threats of bodily harm or
        exhibit firearms, to intimidate their victims and learn the
        whereabouts and combinations of safes or the whereabouts of other
        valuables.     In addition, they would and did use handcuffs, duct
        tape, "ties" and the like to restrain their victims while
        committing the robbery.
             4.      It was further part of the manner and means of this
        conspiracy that defendants, ANTHONY J. CORSO and PAUL DEVITO, and
        Michael P. Fosher, and others known and unknown to the Grand
        Jury, would and did target the homes of persons dealing in
        controlled substances.    The defendants targeted such persons so
        as to minimize the likelihood that their victims would report the
        robbery or testify against them in the event that charges were
        brought.     In addition, it was part of the manner and means of the
        conspiracy that defendants sought to steal controlled substances
        both for their own use and for distribution to others.
             5.    It was further part of the manner and means of this
        conspiracy that defendants, ANTHONY J. CORSO and PAUL DEVITO, and
        Michael P. Fosher would obtain and use badges, firearms, and
        search warrants and would impersonate federal law enforcement
        agents as a way of gaining entry to the home; when demanding
        money or drugs, they would tell the victims that they would be
        coming back with a police dog.
             6.    It was further part of the manner and means of this
        conspiracy that defendants, ANTHONY J. CORSO and PAUL DEVITO, and

the federal Drug Enforcement Administration, that they had a
search warrant, and that they wanted access to the safe.
        11.     When Brian Borodaty had trouble opening the safe,
Michael P. Fosher held a firearm to Brian Borodaty's head.
Defendant ANTHONY J. CORSO and Michael P. Fosher then stole

        13    On a date unknown to the Grand Jury, but in or about
April, 1993, Michael P. Fosher recruited defendants ANTHONY J.
CORSO and PAUL DEVITO to commit a robbery in Brookline,
Massachusetts.
        14.    On April 5, 1993, defendants, ANTHONY J. CORSO and PAUL
DEVITO, and Michael P. Fosher drove to Brookline, Massachusetts
in a White Acura Legend sedan usually used by defendant ANTHONY
J. CORSO.       On their way, they called a person known to the Grand

leaving the premises, they claimed that they would be back with a
police dog.   While driving away from the target premises, Michael
P. Fosher threw a firearm out of the White Acura Legend sedan.
     16.   On April 5, 1993, defendants, ANTHONY J. CORSO and PAUL
DEVITO, and Michael P. Fosher caused Frank M. Marazzo, Jr. to
make a false report to the police that the White Acura Legend
sedan had been stolen.    They abandoned the White Acura Legend
sedan, removing its license plate so at to minimize the
likelihood that it would be found by the police.        Defendant
ANTHONY J. CORSO further made arrangements to have the car towed
to a car dealership in Foxboro, Massachusetts.

defendant,
                        FRANK M. MARAZZO, JR.,

knowingly make false material declarations, in that he testified
that on April 5, 1993 he had been driving the white Acura Legend
sedan usually driven by Anthony J. Corso, and had returned to
where he had parked it only to find it stolen, when in truth and
in fact, as he then and there well knew and believed, this
testimony was false in that he had not borrowed the car that day,
had not driven the car that day, but rather had been asked to
report it stolen as part of an effort to create an alibi for

had used the white Acura in the course of their getaway from a
home invasion/robbery on Brook street, Brookline, Massachusetts
on or about April 5, 1993.
