                           ORDER ON MOTIONS IN LIMINE


         Before the Court is Defendant Dario Giambro’s Motion in Limine Re: Evidence

  of Absence of Registration of Firearm in National Firearm Registration and Transfer

  Record (F.R.E. 803(10)) (Docket # 42). For the reasons set forth below, this Motion in

  Limine is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. Also before the Court is Defendant’s

  Motion in Limine Re: Evidence of Disclosure of Information during Compliance Attempt

  (26 U.S.C. 5848) (Docket # 48). The Court RESERVES RULING on this Motion in

  Limine until trial. Counsel is free to raise any objections at trial as they may arise. All

  final determinations of admissibility will be made at trial based on the record and

  objections presented to the Court at that time.

         Dario Giambro is charged via indictment with one count of knowingly possessing

  a firearm that was not registered to him in the National Firearms Registration and

  Transfer Record (NFRTR) in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 5861(d) et seq. Through the first

  Motion in Limine (Docket # 42), Defendant seeks to prevent the government from

  introducing evidence that a search of the NFRTR was performed and that no record of

  registration of the firearm was found. Defendant asserts that the NFRTR is incomplete,

  untrustworthy and unreliable, and, therefore, evidence of nonexistence of any registration

  is not admissible.

          As an exception to the hearsay rule, Federal Rule of Evidence 803(10) provides

  that:

          To prove the absence of a record, report, statement, or data compilation, in
          any form, or the nonoccurrence or nonexistence of a matter of which a
          record, report, statement, or data compilation, in any form, was regularly
          made and preserved by a public office or agency, evidence in the form of a
          certification in accordance with rule 902, or testimony, that diligent search
          failed to disclose the record, report, statement, or data compilation, or
          entry.

  The government has indicated that it will offer two certificates of non-registration under

  Rule 803(10) to show that neither Defendant’s name nor the firearm appear in the

  NFRTR.

          Underlying hearsay exceptions, including Rule 803(10), is the principle that

  “[e]vidence that is otherwise admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule is

  admissible primarily because evidence of that kind is generally trustworthy, but if, in a

  particular instance, the circumstances indicate a lack of trustworthiness, the evidence

  should be excluded.” United States v. Robinson, 544 F.2d 110, 115 (2d Cir. 1976).

          In the present case, Defendant has proffered general evidence that there may have

  been problems with the NFRTR in the past. Defendant has failed to sho w that the

  NFRTR is currently unreliable or is unreliable as it pertains to him. See United States v.

  Rith, 164 F.3d 1323, 1337 (10th Cir. 1999) (stating that, in relation to a Sixth

  Amendment challenge, the defendant had “allege[d] no defect in the NFRTR as it

  pertain[ed] to him. General claims of unreliability, particularly those that rely upon

  outdated information, are not sufficient . . . .”). Nor has Defendant indicated that a less




                                              -2-
Case 2:07-cr-00041-GZS Document 57 Filed 08/17/07 Page 3 of 3                  PageID #: 273



  than diligent search of the NFRTR was conducted, and diligence is the touchstone of

  trustworthiness.   See Robinson, 544 F.2d at 115.        In contrast, in United States v.

  Robinson it was determined that a partial search or incomplete records could not support

  the conclusion that the record did not exist. Id. In addition, the proposed testimony of

  Eric Larson does not aid Defendant. Rather, Mr. Larson’s statements largely contain

  conjecture, speculation and lack any scientific basis.

         On the record before the Court at this time, the Court is satisfied that the NFRTR

  is sufficiently reliable to permit the introduction of the two certificates under Rule

  803(10). See United States v. Rith, 164 F.3d 1323, 1336 (10th Cir. 1999) (holding that

  the NFRTR had sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness so as not to violate the Sixth

  Amendment).

         The Court therefore DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE Defendant’s first Motion

  in Limine (Docket #42).      The Court RESERVES RULING on Defendant’s second

  Motion in Limine (Docket # 48).



  SO ORDERED.
