STATEMENT OF REASONS

VII COURT DETERMINATIONS OF RESTITUTION
A m sanitation Not Appiicabie.
B Total Amount of Restitution:

C Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

1 |:] For offenses for which restitution i`s otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under lS U S.C § 3663A(e)(3)(A).

2 [:l For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex

issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under lB U.S C § 3663A(e)(3){B)

3 m For other offenses l'or which restitution is authorized under lB U.S C § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not

ordered because the complication and prolongation ofthe sentencing process resulting from the fashioning ofa restitutton order outweigh
the need to provide restitution to any victims under lS U.S C § 3663(a)(l)(B)(ii).
