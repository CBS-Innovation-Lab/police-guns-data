                         UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                          DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

    V.                                               CR.NO. 12-CR-167-03-SM

QUENTIN SIMON

  GOVERNMENT’S ASSENTED TO MOTION TO CONTINUE SUPERVISED
               RELEASE REVOCATION HEARING


   NOW COMES the United States of America, by and through John P. Kacavas, United

States Attorney for the District of New Hampshire, and hereby requests that the

supervised release revocation hearing currently scheduled for Wednesday, April 8, 2015,

be continued for a period of thirty days. In support thereof, the Government states as

follows:

         1.    The parties are attempting to resolve this matter by agreement but have not

               been able to do so by today’s date.

         2.    If a contested hearing is necessary, the government would call Detective

               Patrick Nichols of the New York City Police Department to testify as a

               witness. Unfortunately, Detective Nichols is unavailable on Wednesday,

               April 8, 2015, and additional time is necessary to make arrangements for

               Detective Nichols to travel to New Hampshire.

         3.    This is the first request for a continuance of the hearing by the

               Government.

         4.    The Defendant does not object to this motion.

         5.    No memorandum of law is required to resolve the issues raised herein.



         WHEREFORE, the Government respectfully requests that this Honorable Court

continue the supervised release revocation hearing for thirty days to allow Detective

Nichols to testify.
