STATEMENT OF REASONS

VII COURT DETERMINATIONS OF RESTITUTION
A m Restitution Not Applicable.
B Total Amount of Restitution:

C Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

1 [:] For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(A)_

2 m For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex

issues offact and relating them to the cause or amount ofthe victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(B)

3 [:l For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
ordered because the complication and prolongation ofthe sentencing process resulting from the fashioning ofa restitution order outweigh

the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(1)(B)(ii).

4 [:] Restitution is not ordered for other reasons (Exp|ain_)

D l:l Partial restitution is ordered for these reasons t18 U.S.C. § 3553(€)):

Vlll ADDITIONAL FACTS JUSTlFYlNG THE SENTENCE lN THIS CASE (lfapplicable.)

The Govemment and Defendant agreed to a binding plea in which they both miscalculated the impact of the career offender provisions
under USSG § 4B1.1. Nevertheless, the parties agree that the lower sentence is warranted because l) the predicate offenses are old and
defendant just barely qualifies as a career offender, 2) it avoids unwarranted disparities with the sentences of his co-defendants, and 3)
the Govemment saved the Court considerable trouble and resources by putting this defendant to trial, separately.

Sections l, 11, lll, lV, and Vll of the Statement ofReasons form must be completed in all felony cases.
