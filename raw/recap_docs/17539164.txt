GORTON, J.

     On April 4, 1997, a grand jury returned a 34 count

Indictment (“the Indictment”) against 15 defendants and

specifically named petitioner Ciampi in 23 of those counts.      The

first trial of Ciampi and others on those counts ended on January

12, 1999.    The jury convicted Ciampi of operating an illegal

gambling business in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1955 as charged in

Count 34 of the Indictment, acquitted him on four counts and was

unable to reach a verdict with respect to the remaining 18 counts

against him.

I.   Background

     Before Ciampi’s retrial began on October 25, 1999, new

counsel was appointed to represent him.    On November 1, 1999,

Ciampi pled guilty to Count Three of the Indictment charging him

with conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering in

violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1959 and to a one-count Superseding


                                 -1-
Information charging him with attempt to commit a crime involving

assault with a dangerous weapon and assault resulting in serious

bodily injury in violation of § 1959.    In his plea agreement, he

expressly waived any statute of limitations defense that he might

have had.

     On March 1, 2000, this Court sentenced Ciampi to 216 months

(18 years) in prison based on the agreed-upon disposition in his

plea agreement calling for consecutive prison sentences of 60

months on Count Thirty-Four of the Indictment, 120 months on

Count Three and 36 months on Count One of the Superseding

Information.    In his plea agreement, Ciampi waived his right to

appeal or to assert certain collateral challenges.    Judgment was

accordingly entered against Ciampi on March 8, 2000.

     In February, 2001, Ciampi, proceeding pro se, filed a motion

to vacate his sentence pursuant 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (“the original

petition”).    With leave of this Court, Ciampi, represented by

counsel, amended that petition in October, 2002 (“the amended

petition”).    The government opposed the original and amended

petitions and moved to dismiss the amended petition.    In

September, 2003, this Court allowed the government’s motion to

dismiss and denied Ciampi’s § 2255 motion.    That Order was upheld

by the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.    United States v.

Ciampi, 419 F.3d 20 (1st Cir. 2005).

     In March, 2005, Ciampi filed a motion for relief from


                                 -2-
judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6).    He requested that

this Court set aside its Order dismissing his 28 U.S.C. § 2255

motion.    In it he contended that, in denying his § 2255 motion,

this Court did not address all the claims raised in his original

petition.    Moreover, he asserted that the Court could not have

considered all of the evidence relating to those claims because

it never received his reply to the government’s opposition that

was timely filed.    In December, 2008, the Court denied the

motion.

     Ciampi now moves again for relief from judgment pursuant to

Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(4) and 60(b)(6) and for reconsideration

pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255, of his 36-month consecutive

sentence for Count One of the Superceding Information.    He

maintains that Count One of the Superseding Information, for

assault, was void because it was executed on November 1, 1999,

five years and seven months after the assault occurred on March

31, 1994.    Thus, the Superseding Information was not executed

within the five-year statute of limitations period defined by 18

U.S.C. § 3282.    As such, Ciampi argues, the Court did not have

jurisdiction to take his plea of guilty or sentence him for that

crime.    The motion has not been opposed by the government.

     As of the filing of his motion, Ciampi had served over 14

years and his projected release date is January 15, 2013.




                                 -3-
II.   Ciampi’s Motion for Relief from Judgment Pursuant to Fed. R.
      Civ. P. 60(b)(4) and 60(b)(6)

      A.    Legal Standard

      Rule 60(b)(4) allows a court to relieve a party from a final

judgment on the basis that the judgment is void.     Fed. R. Civ. P.

60(b)(4).    A judgment is void if the Court lacked jurisdiction at

the time it was executed.    Hoult v. Hoult, 57 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.

1995).

      Rule 60(b)(6) allows a court to relieve a party from a final

judgment for “any other reason that justifies relief.”     Fed. R.

Civ. P. 60(b)(6).    The word “other” has the effect of excluding

motions more appropriately brought pursuant to Rule 60(b)(1)

through (5).    Although seemingly broad in scope, Rule 60(b)(6)

has been termed a “small escape hatch” requiring “exceptional

circumstances that justify extraordinary relief.”     United States

v. 6 Fox Street, 480 F.3d 38, 46 (1st Cir. 2007) (citation and

internal quotation marks omitted).

      B.    Application

      Ciampi argues that the statute of limitations set forth in

18 U.S.C. § 3282(a) is a jurisdictional rule.     If a

jurisdictional deadline is not met, the court loses jurisdiction

to take the action described in the statute.     Dolan v. United

States, 130 S. Ct. 2533, 2538 (2010).    “The prohibition is

absolute.    The parties cannot waive it, nor can a court extend

that deadline for equitable reasons.”    Id.   In contrast,

                                 -4-
affirmative defenses and “claims-processing rules” can be waived.

Id.   “Claims-processing rules” relate to the orderly progression

of litigation through procedural steps required to be taken at

certain times.     Henderson v. Shinseki, 131 S. Ct. 1197, 1202

(2011).

      In determining whether a time limitation is intended to be

jurisdictional, the Court must examine the statute’s language,

structure and purpose.     Dolan, 130 S. Ct. at 2538.    The answer is

different depending on the particular statute and time limit at

issue.    Id.   “Under Arbaugh, we look to see if there is any

‘clear’ indication that Congress wanted the rule to be

‘jurisdictional.’”      Henderson, 131 S. Ct. at 1203.    “When a long

line of this Court’s decisions left undisturbed by Congress has

treated a similar requirement as jurisdictional, we will presume

that Congress intended to follow that course.”     Id. (internal

quotation and citation omitted).

      The statute proscribing a time limit for federal criminal

offenses, 18 U.S.C. § 3282(a), states that

      Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, no person
      shall be prosecuted, tried, or punished for any offense,
      not capital, unless the indictment is found or the
      information is instituted within five years next after
      such offense shall have been committed.

Ciampi argues that § 3282 is a jurisdictional statute of

limitations because 1) it incorporates emphatic limiting

language, 2) it uses the word “shall” with specified consequences


                                  -5-
for failure to meet the five-year deadline and 3) the location of

§ 3282 within Chapter 213, Limitations, following Chapters 211

and 212 which confer jurisdiction and venue for criminal and

military cases, indicates that it creates a limit to

jurisdiction.

     At the time of Ciampi’s plea, the Supreme Court had not

addressed whether the statute of limitations in § 3282 provided

for a jurisdictional or affirmative defense.   Nevertheless, the

First Circuit, along with every circuit to address the issue, had

held it to be an affirmative defense which can be waived.

Acevedo-Ramos v. United States, 961 F.2d 305, 307 (1st Cir.

1992); Rivera-Colon v. United States, Civ. No. 05-1411, 2008 WL

4559684, at *8 (D.P.R. Oct. 9, 2008).

     Ciampi argues that such case law should be overruled in

light of the analysis set forth by the United States Supreme

Court in Dolan v. United States, 130 S. Ct. at 2539.   In that

case, the Court held that the district court had the power to

impose restitution beyond the statutory deadline because it had

stated prior to the deadline’s expiration that it would do so.

Ciampi is correct that the Court articulated several

considerations for determining whether or not a rule is

jurisdictional.   In the wake of Dolan, however, no federal court

has questioned the long-established understanding that the

statute of limitations in § 3282 is an affirmative defense which


                                -6-
can be waived.   See, e.g., United States v. Flood, 635 F.3d 1255,

1258-59 (10th Cir. 2011); United States v. Sharp, 400 Fed. Appx.

741, 751 (4th Cir. 2010).   The Court finds no reason to question

such well-established case law without a clear directive from the

First Circuit or the United States Supreme Court.

     In this case, Ciampi expressly waived any statute of

limitations defense that he might have had in his plea agreement.

Thus, Ciampi’s Rule 60(b) motion will be denied.

III. Ciampi’s § 2255 Motion

     Ciampi’s § 2255 motion is barred by the one-year statute of

limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f).   That section

provides that the limitation period shall run from the latest of:

     (1) the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes
     final;

     (2) the date on which the impediment to making a motion
     created by governmental action in violation of the
     Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if
     the movant was prevented from making a motion by such
     governmental action;

     (3) the date on which the right asserted was initially
     recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been
     newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made
     retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review;
     or

     (4) the date on which the facts supporting the claim or
     claims presented could have been discovered through the
     exercise of due diligence.

     It has been not only more than one year but more than one

decade since the date on which Ciampi’s conviction became final,

and none of the other potential dates listed in § 2255(f) applies

                                -7-
here.   It is clear that Dolan did not recognize any new right

and, as such, the date set forth in § 2255(f)(3) does not apply.

Thus, Ciampi’s motion for § 2255 relief is barred by the one-year

statute of limitations set forth in that section.   28 U.S.C.A. §

2255(f).

                               ORDER

     In accordance with the foregoing, defendants’ motion for

relief from judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) and for

reconsideration pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (Docket No. 1408) is

DENIED.
