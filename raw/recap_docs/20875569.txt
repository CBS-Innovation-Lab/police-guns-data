JUAN NUNEZ,
    Defendant.

               REPORT AND
         RECOMMENDATION ON
      PETITIONER’S MOTION UNDER
       28 U.S.C. § 2255 TO VACATE,
  SET ASIDE, OR CORRECT SENTENCE BY
 A PERSON IN FEDERAL CUSTODY (#500)
COLLINGS, U.S.M.J.
                                   I. Introduction



     The   pro se   petitioner Juan Nunez (“petitioner” or “Nunez”) seeks to vacate
his conviction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Nunez was convicted after a ten-
day jury trial of heroin-related offenses and was sentenced to 151 months in
prison. His conviction was affirmed on appeal.       See United States v. Santiago,
560 F.3d 62 (1 Cir.),
               st
                                   , 130 S. Ct. 140 (2009). The government
                        cert. denied



urges summary dismissal of the petition, contending that the claims are
conclusively belied by the record, or are insufficiently developed to warrant
habeas relief. For the reasons that follow, the Court shall recommend that the
motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 be DENIED.
                    II. Factual and Procedural Background



      Nunez was arrested in connection with his participation in a heroin
distribution organization in Lowell, Massachusetts. The investigation, led by
the Drug Enforcement Agency (“”DEA”), included visual surveillance, court-
authorized wire-taps of the defendants’ cell phones, and seizure of drugs and
paraphernalia from certain defendants (but not from Nunez).   See Santiago   , 560
F.3d at 65. Nunez’s defense at trial was that he was, at most, a friend of
Santiago, the organization’s leader, and that wire-taped conversations between
Santiago and Nunez were consistent with this theory. The jury evidently
rejected this theory, because it convicted Nunez and four others of conspiracy
to distribute heroin. The jury also found that the conspiracy involved at least
one kilogram of heroin.
      On October 19, 2009, Nunez filed the present Motion Under 28 U.S.C. §


                                       2
2255 to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence by a Person in Custody (#500).
On February 24, 2010, the government filed its Response to Defendant’s Motion
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 and Request for Summary Dismissal (#515). On
April 19, 2010, Nunez filed a Reply to the Government Opposition of his 28
U.S.C. § 2255 [sic] (#519). On April 27, 2010, the government filed its
Response to Defendant’s Reply Memorandum (#520), to which it attached the
Affidavit of Roger Witkin, Esquire, Nunez’s trial and appellate counsel. In
response, Nunez filed his Reply to the Government Supplement [sic] Motion
Filed on 04-27-2010, with an Unsworn Affidavit from Mr. Roger Witkin (#521).
On May 21, 2012, the government filed, at the Court’s direction, an amended
Affidavit of Roger Witkin (#575). The motions are thus ripe for disposition.1



        1

         On May 30, 2012, Nunez requested permission to supplement his petition with a claim based on the
Supreme Court’s recent decision in United States v. Jones, 132 S. Ct. 945 (2012). (See #576) In Jones, the
Supreme Court held that “the Government's installation of a GPS device on a target's vehicle, and its use of
that device to monitor the vehicle's movements, constitutes a ‘search’” within the meaning of the Fourth
Amendment. Id. at 949 (footnote omitted). The government, in opposition, argues that the claim is
untimely, that Nunez lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality of a search of his co-defendant’s car,
and that, in any event, the government complied with the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement.
(#578) Timeliness aside, there is no dispute that the GPS device was placed on a minivan owned by a co-
defendant, and not on Nunez’s car. Nunez would not have standing to challenge that search. See United
States v. Kimball, 25 F.3d 1, 9 (1 Cir. 1994) (“In order to embark on a suppression challenge, a defendant
                                 st


must show that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the area searched . . . .”)(internal quotation
marks and citation omitted). In addition, the government has presented evidence that the government, in
fact, complied with the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement, and so any claim is conclusively rebutted
by the record.

                                  III. Discussion



      Nunez asserts ten grounds for relief in his petition: 1) his conviction was
obtained through the false testimony of DEA agents; 2) his arrest was illegal
because DEA agents failed to advise him of his Miranda rights; 3) trial counsel
was ineffective in failing to make an opening statement; 4) trial counsel was
ineffective because he “knew . . . that the Government plot against his client
Nunez [was] false”; 5) trial counsel was ineffective in failing to heed Nunez’s
wishes to testify in his own defense; 6) trial counsel was ineffective in failing to
call Nunez’s wife to testify at trial; 7) trial counsel was ineffective in failing to
deliver a persuasive closing argument; 8) trial counsel was ineffective in failing
to make meaningful objections at trial; 9) appellate counsel was ineffective in
failing to present all the previous claims on direct appeal; and 10) trial counsel
was ineffective in failing to move to dismiss the “defective indictment.”
      A. Legal Principles
      Most of Nunez’s claims are governed by the familiar standard set out in
Strickland v. Washington   , 466 U.S. 668, 688, 694 (1984). To succeed on a Sixth
Amendment claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must
establish that his "counsel's representation 'fell below an objective standard of


                                         4
reasonableness'” and that “'there is a reasonable probability that, but for
counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been
different.'"   Moreno-Espada v. United States     , 666 F.3d 60, 64 (1 Cir. 2012)
                                                                         st




(quoting   Padilla v. Kentucky   , 130 S. Ct. 1473, 1482 (2010) (further internal
quotation marks and citation omitted)). Under          Strickland    , “[a] reasonable
probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.”
Strickland , 466 U.S. at 694. With regard to the performance aspect of the
standard, "[t]here is a 'strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within
the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,' and [a petitioner] 'must
overcome the presumption that . . . the challenged action might be considered
sound trial strategy.'"                   , 621 F.3d 59, 66 (1 Cir. 2010) (quoting
                          Tevlin v. Spencer
                                                                st

deficient under    Strickland   ‘only where, given the facts known at the time,
counsel's choice was so patently unreasonable that no competent attorney
would have made it.'" . (quoting
                           Id           Knight v. Spencer   , 447 F.3d 6, 15 (1 Cir.
                                                                                st




2006)).
   B. The Claims

                                              5
       Ground 1   was not raised on direct appeal, although it could have been,
and it can be dismissed on that ground alone. Knight v. United States, 37 F.3d
769, 773 (1 Cir. 1994) (“Having bypassed his opportunity to raise the claim on
             st




direct appeal, [a petitioner] cannot raise it . . . on collateral attack.”). Although
Nunez in Ground 9 faults his appellate counsel for failing to raise the claim on
direct appeal, both the claim itself and the derivative ineffective-assistance-of-
counsel claim fail for complete lack of development. Nunez has offered no
particularized allegations to suggest that DEA agents offered false testimony.
Nunez’s trial counsel subjected the agents to pointed cross-examination on the
particulars of their evidence, (see, e.g., # 419, VII: 9-18; 53-64; 76-86; 98-103),
and the jury evidently chose to believe that evidence.           Likewise, Ground
2   could have been raised on direct appeal, but was not, and can be dismissed
on that ground. In any event, the claim is meritless. At bottom, Nunez
complains that the arresting agents never provided him with his Miranda
warnings. But a constitutional violation occurs “only upon the admission of
unwarned statements into evidence at trial. And, at that point, the exclusion of
unwarned statements is a complete and sufficient remedy for any perceived
Miranda violation.”       United States v. Patane, 542 U.S. 630, 641-42


                                         6
(2004)(alterations, internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here,
Nunez does not contend that he was prejudiced by the admission at trial of any
unwarned statements. It follows that counsel could not have been ineffective
in failing to raise this claim.
      The Court agrees with the government that        Grounds 3 and 7      are
conclusively rebutted by the record. Trial counsel delivered an opening and
closing statement, in which he vigorously argued trial counsel’s theory of the
case, viz., that Nunez and Santiago were old friends and not co-conspirators,
and that the evidence did not support Nunez’s involvement in the drug
trafficking scheme. These claims are thus facially meritless.
      Ground 4    fails for lack of any developed credible allegations. Nunez
simply claims that his counsel was ineffective because his counsel knew that the
government had made up a plot against his client. This allegation is sheer
undeveloped speculation and Nunez has failed to satisfy both the performance
and prejudice prongs of Strickland.
      In Ground 5, Nunez alleges that he “told his counsel that he wanted to
testif[y].” (#500 at 6) He essentially says that he would have testified that he
did not sell drugs to Santiago, that Santiago did not buy any drugs from him,


                                       7
and that Santiago never told Nunez where he was getting his drugs. He also
contends that he would have testified that when he called Santiago about going
to the game, this was true. In short, Nunez suggests that his trial counsel failed
to heed Nunez’s wish to testify; and he contends that his testimony would have
served to establish that he was not involved in the drug trafficking scheme, and
that government witnesses mischaracterized intercepted conversations between
Santiago and Nunez as coded language about drugs.
      “There is no doubt ‘that a defendant has a fundamental constitutional
right to testify in his own defense,’ and that the defendant, not his attorney, is
the one who makes the ultimate decision whether to testify or not.” United
States v. Merlino, 592 F.3d 22, 26 (1 Cir.) (quoting Owens v. United States, 483
                                      st




F.3d 48, 58 (1 Cir. 2007) (further internal quotation marks and citation
                st




omitted)), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 283 (2010). In moving for summary denial,
the government argues that Nunez’s allegations lack the specificity required to
support a claim that trial counsel interfered with Nunez’s right to testify or
failed to advise him of his right to testify. See, e.g., Siciliano v. Vose, 834 F.2d
29, 31 (1 Cir. 1987) (affirming summary denial of claim that trial counsel
          st




prevented petitioner from testifying where claim lacked specific and detailed

                                           8
supporting facts). In addition, the government relies on the affidavit of Roger
Witkin (“Witkin”), Nunez’s trial counsel. In that affidavit, Witkin avers that it
is his practice to advise criminal defendants of their constitutional right to
testify and not to testify at trial, and that he advised Nunez of this right. He
further avers that “[a]t no time did Mr. Nunez inform me that he wished to
testify at trial in this case. In fact, after discussing the government’s evidence
with him, Mr. Nunez agreed it was in his best interest not to testify at trial.”
(#575 ¶ 4) In response to Witkin’s affidavit, Nunez states that “Mr. Witkin
never gave [him] any advice of [his] constitutional right to testify or not testify
at . . . trial.” (#521 at 2)
      “Once a prisoner requests relief under § 2255, a district court must grant
an evidentiary hearing on the prisoner’s claims unless ‘the motion and the files
and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no
relief.’” Owens v. United States, 483 F.3d 48, 57 (1 Cir. 2007) (quoting 28
                                                       st




U.S.C. § 2255). Furthermore, under First Circuit precedent, “an evidentiary
hearing is warranted on . . . [a right-to-testify] claim only where the allegations
are ‘highly specific and usually accompanied by some independent
corroboration.’” Duguay v. Spencer, 811 F. Supp.2d 531, 532 (D. Mass. 2011)


                                        9
(quoting Siciliano v. Vose, 834 F.2d 29, 31 (1 Cir.1987) (quoting United States
                                              st




v. Butt, 731 F.2d 75, 80 n. 5 (1 Cir. 1984))). In short, the First Circuit has
                                 st




required some substantiation or some independent corroboration beyond bare-
boned assertions to support such a claim. In Owens itself, for example, “Owens
and one of Owens’ trial attorneys provided detailed affidavits indicating that
Owens was never told of his right to testify at trial.” Owens, 483 F.3d at 60.
Here, Nunez’s assertion that his counsel failed to inform him of the right to
testify (asserted for the first time in response to Witkin’s affidavit) lacks the
specificity and the requisite corroboration to warrant an evidentiary hearing.
      Moreover, Nunez’s own submissions confirm that he and Witkin had
conversations about whether Nunez would testify: Nunez essentially says that
he asked Witkin to testify and that Witkin advised against it. Thus, “the
undisputed facts confirm not only that Petitioner knew he had a right testify,
but that he and his attorney discussed the option several times.” McCann v.
United States, 528 F. Supp.2d 4, 6 (D. Mass. 2008) (noting that “[t]he affidavit
of Petitioner's counsel, and indeed the submissions of Petitioner himself,
confirm that counsel and Petitioner discussed the possibility of Petitioner's
testifying more than once”). Cf. also Siciliano, 834 F.2d at 31 (record suggests

                                       10
that petitioner “knew that, legally speaking, he could testify if he chose; but he
chose not to testify as a matter of trial strategy, perhaps at the strong urging of
counsel”); Osorio-Norena v. United States, 658 F. Supp.2d 266, 273 (D. Mass.
2009) (“as in Siciliano, the petitioner’s affidavit and the record suggests that he
knew that he could testify but was strategically dissuaded from so doing by
defense counsel”); see also United States v. Ouimette, No. 99-489-ML, 2010 WL
1839416, at *4 (D.R.I. May 6, 2010) (“Here, there is no question that Ouimette
knew of his right to testify, as it is undisputed that he and [his counsel] had a
number of conversations concerning whether he should do so.”).
      Finally, “[u]naccompanied by coercion, legal advice concerning exercise
of the right to testify infringes no right, but simply discharges counsel’s ethical
responsibility to the accused.” Lema v. United States, 987 F.2d 48, 52 (1 Cir.
                                                                             st




1993)(citations omitted). Nunez does not allege that counsel coerced him into
relinquishing his right to testify. And on this record, the Court cannot conclude
that it would have been unreasonable trial strategy to advise Nunez not to
testify and to put the government to its burden of proof. As the government
points out, Nunez would have been forced to explain the cryptic nature of his
recorded phone calls with Santiago, and the furtive nature of some of his

                                        11
actions at odd hours, all recounted by agents who had surveilled him. (See
#515 at 16)
      Moreover, even assuming (contrary to the record evidence) that Nunez
was unaware of his right to testify, Nunez has failed to establish the prejudice
prong of the Strickland standard. See McCann, 528 F. Supp.2d at 7 (“The First
Circuit recognized in Owens that in certain circumstances a failure to inform a
defendant of his right to testify might result in no prejudice and therefore fail
to qualify a Petitioner for habeas relief.”). Here, Nunez simply states that he
would have testified that he was not engaged in drug trafficking with Santiago.
There were many details, however, that warranted an innocent explanation;
Nunez could have readily supplied that explanation in an affidavit. Cf. Vega-
Encarnacion v. United States, 933 F.2d 1531 (Table), 1993 WL 138536, at *4 (1   st




Cir. 1993) (per curiam) (unpublished) (“In essence, appellant’s argument
regarding prejudice boils down to the bare assertion that had appellant been
allowed to testify, he would have adequately rebutted and explained [the
witness’s statements]. What is lacking . . . is any indication of what appellant’s
testimony would have been.”). Without the requisite particularity offering
“genuinely exculpatory testimony,” Owens, 483 F.3d at 59, Nunez has failed to

                                       12
establish a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been
different.     Cf. P almer v. Hendricks, 592 F.3d 386, 396 (3rd Cir. 2010) (noting
that Owens’ standard is not “onerous” but that “it must be sufficiently detailed
to be ‘genuinely exculpatory,’” and rejecting argument that Owens adopted a
rule of per-se prejudice in right-to-testify cases).2 In short, even if the standard
is not onerous, Nunez could have provided some detail in an effort to rebut or
explain the government’s evidence. In the absence of this minimal showing, the
Court concludes that Nunez has failed to establish the requisite prejudice.
        In Ground 6, Nunez argues that his counsel was ineffective in failing to
call Nunez’s wife to testify. Nunez contends that his wife would have testified
about the “truth about her husband[’s] association with Santiago.” (#500 at 6)
Presumably, then, she would have testified that Nunez was merely friends with
Santiago. Trial counsel’s “decision to present the[] testimony [of potential
witnesses], must be evaluated in light of whatever trial strategy reasonably

        2

          In Owens itself, the First Circuit concluded that the petitioner’s statement in his affidavit that he
“would have testified that he did not have any role in the murders charged” satisfied the prejudice
requirement. Owens v. United States, 483 F.3d 48, 59 n.8 (1 Cir. 2007). Notably, however, in the Owens
                                                                st


case, the defendant had been acquitted of several charges, including another murder, and the district court
in Owens had concluded that these facts were pertinent to the prejudice inquiry. See Owens v, United States,
236 F. Supp. 2d 122, 143 (D. Mass. 2002) (following per-se prejudice standard but noting significance of
acquittals), aff’d in part, rev’d in part, 483 F.3d 48 (1 Cir. 2007). Nunez’s vague proposed testimony,
                                                           st


however, does not establish a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different,
i.e., “a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome." Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694.
                                                      13
competent counsel devised in the context of the particular case.” Lema, 987
F.2d at 55. Here, trial counsel’s strategy was to hold the government to its
burden of proof, and to argue that the government had failed to establish that
Nunez was involved in the conspiracy at all. “The decision whether to call a
particular witness is almost always strategic, requiring a balancing of the
benefits and risks of the anticipated testimony.” Id. at 54. Given counsel’s
decision in this case to argue the weaknesses of the government’s case, counsel
may well have wanted to avoid the pitfalls that come with putting any witness
on the stand, even favorable ones. Cf. id. (“the risk of ‘rocking the boat’ may
warrant a decision by trial counsel to forego the presentation of further defense
testimony, even favorable testimony.”). In short, there is no reason to think that
counsel’s decision not to call Nunez’s wife as a witness was anything but a
strategic decision: counsel may well have concluded that the testimony of a
biased witness would have done little to counter the government’s evidence,
and might have left the defense exposed to uncertain government cross-
examination. Here, Nunez’s counsel, in his affidavit, further elaborates that any
“information that [he] would have sought to elicit from Mr. Nunez’s wife was
elicited from Captain Terry Hanson of the Massachusetts State Police during


                                       14
cross-examination.” (#575 ¶ 5) During cross-examination, Hanson conceded
that a search of Nunez’s home turned up no drugs, drug paraphernalia or sums
of cash. Nunez’s counsel further avers that “[t]he risk of potentially damaging
information being elicited from Mr. Nunez’s wife during the government’s cross-
examination of her, in my professional opinion, outweighed any potential
benefit from her direct testimony in these circumstances.” (Id.) Nunez has not
overcome the presumption that the decision here was a tactical decision.
      In Ground 8, Nunez claims that his counsel was ineffective in merely
“pretending” to make objections at trial. This contention is belied by the record,
and requires little discussion. Even a cursory review of the trial transcripts
reveals that counsel actively and vigorously lodged objections throughout the
trial, (see, e.g., # 415: Tr. I:168-169; # 416: II: 123; VII:30), and vigorously
cross-examined the government’s witnesses. For example, defense counsel
elicited from the GPS technician that co-defendant Julio Santiago’s trips to
Nunez’s house in Brooklyn tended to last for several hours; from the surveilling
officer that although co-defendant Santiago carried a “garment bag” into
Nunez’s house, the officer had no idea what was in the bag; and from the
arresting officer, that a thorough search of Nunez’s home turned up no heroin


                                       15
or drug paraphernalia.         Furthermore, this case involved multiple
defendants–government witnesses called were cross-examined by a lead defense
counsel, depending on the significance of the witnesses’s testimony to the
particular defendant. Nunez lived in New York, and had contact with one co-
conspirator in Massachusetts, Julio Santiago. Thus, it would have made no
sense for Nunez’s counsel to cross-examine witnesses who testified about their
investigation into the surveillance of co-conspirators in Massachusetts.
      In Ground 9, Nunez faults his appellate counsel for failing to raise any of
the above claims in the direct appeal. Appellate counsel "need not (and should
not) raise every nonfrivolous claim, but rather may select from among them in
order to maximize the likelihood of success on appeal." Smith v. Robbins, 528
U.S. 259, 288 (2000). And "[g]enerally, only when ignored issues are clearly
stronger that those presented, will the presumption of effective assistance of
counsel be overcome." Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As
noted in the discussion of the claims, only Grounds 1 and 2 could have been
presented on direct appeal. For the reasons noted above, those claims would
have lacked merit even if appellate counsel had raised them. Otherwise, the
First Circuit has repeatedly held that ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims


                                       16
may not ordinarily be brought on direct appeal. See, e.g., United States v. Ofray-
Campos, 534 F.3d 1, 34 (1st Cir.), cert. denied. 555 U.S. 1020 (2008). Thus,
appellate counsel was not ineffective in failing to raise the remaining claims.
      Finally, in Ground 10, Nunez claims that his counsel was ineffective in
failing to move to dismiss “the Defective Indictment.” The claim is wholly
undeveloped: Nunez fails to identify the purported defect in the indictment.
Nunez has necessarily failed to establish a constitutional violation under
Strickland. See David v. United States, 134 F.3d 470, 478 (1st Cir. 1998) (habeas
petitioner should not receive an evidentiary hearing “if his allegations are
