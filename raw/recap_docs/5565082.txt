                       UNITED STATES’ OPPOSITION
                     TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO SEVER

      The government respectfully submits that defendant JERMAINE

GILMORE’s (“defendant”) motion to sever should be denied.

Defendant has failed to demonstrate actual prejudice that would

necessitate a severance.       A separate trial, moreover, is not

practical due to overlapping evidence.

                                  I. FACTS

A.    Background of Investigation

      In or about September 2004, the Boston Police Department

(“BPD”) and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”)

began an investigation of the drug trafficking activities of

Husie A. Joyner, Gregory R. Bing and others based on information

from a DEA cooperating source (“CS”). The CS told agents that the

CS had purchased crack cocaine from Joyner, the leader of the

group, on at least three occasions. After those three sales, the

CS stated that Joyner had directed the CS to obtain the crack

cocaine from House and Bing.

      Thereafter, between September 24, 2004 and January 11, 2005,


                                         1
     Case 1:05-cr-10239-RCL   Document 308   Filed 05/21/2007   Page 2 of 8



the CS, under the direction and control of the DEA and members of

the BPD Special Investigations Unit (“SIU”), made a series of six

controlled purchases of cocaine and crack cocaine from BING and

Husie Joyner.     During one of these controlled purchases, the

driver of vehicle was defendant JERMAINE GILMORE.

B.    Controlled Purchase of Crack Cocaine Involving GILMORE

      On October 5, 2005, the CS made a controlled purchase of

61.7 grams of cocaine base (“crack”) from BING in the area of

Bing’s residence at 751 Shawmut Avenue in Roxbury.              The

transaction took place in a white Chevrolet Impala which had been

rented by GILMORE.      The CS entered the vehicle and Bing

introduced the driver of the vehicle (GILMORE) as “Calvin.”               Bing

gave the CS the crack cocaine as GILMORE sat in the driver seat.

C.    Intercepted Calls Involving GILMORE

      After the initiation of wiretaps on Bing's phone in April

2005, GILMORE was intercepted on the wiretap talking to Bing

about purchasing thousands of dollars worth of cocaine and

"cooking" (manufacturing) crack cocaine.         In particular, after

incurring a debt of about $15,000 from two separate drug

transaction with Bing, GILMORE asked Bing for specific

instructions on how to cook the cocaine into crack cocaine in

order to make more money.       GILMORE's participation in the

conspiracy was ended only when he was arrested on a federal

supervised release violation on May 24, 2005.

     For example, during a call on April 23, 2005, GILMORE told

Bing that he had "3 dollars" ($3,000) for Bing.         Bing complained

that it should be "7 dollars."      Days later on April 26, 2005, law

enforcement agents observed a male (who was later identified as

GILMORE) who was driving a black Yukon GMC Denali meet with Bing

at a carwash in Roxbury.

     During a call on April 28, 2005, at 3:32 p.m., GILMORE

complained that Bing did not call him back and GILMORE said he

did not like to be sitting around "all this time I got [] change

(money) on me."   GILMORE said, "I don't like holding my f*cking

paper (money) like that man, you know?" The next day, following

several calls on April 29, 2005, agents observed GILMORE meet

again with Bing at the same carwash in Roxbury in order to give

Bing more money and a scale.      After the meeting, agents followed

GILMORE as he drove off in the same black Yukon GMC Denali.             A

marked BPD cruiser conducted a traffic stop of the vehicle and

identified GILMORE as the driver and sole occupant.           The same

evening, Joyner instructed Bing to mix the "250" with the "125"

(grams of crack cocaine).     Bing told Joyner he was using a

"joint" (scale) that "Maine" (GILMORE) had given him.           The next

day, during an intercepted call with Joyner on April 30, 2005,

Bing told Joyner that he was in the truck with "Maine" (GILMORE)

and would be over to see Joyner in a few minutes.

     During a call on May 6, 2005, at 6:22 p.m., Bing and GILMORE


                                    3
   Case 1:05-cr-10239-RCL   Document 308   Filed 05/21/2007   Page 4 of 8



talked about a drug debt that GILMORE owed Bing, for a total of

about $15,000.   Bing said, "Listen..11...you in the hole for 15

dollars already...right...eleven 11 ($11,000) for that thing you

got...and four 4 ($4,000) for the other thing, right?"            Bing then

asked GILMORE how many "grizzes" (grams) he had: "You got 75

joints there....75 grizzies, right?" GILMORE answered, "it's 72

(grams) whatever..”    Bing then suggested that GILMORE have his

man "burn it down" (cook it into crack), because Bing didn't have

time to do it and give him (Bing) back "22" ($2,200).           The same

day on May 6, 2005, at 7:05 p.m., GILMORE called Bing and asked

Bing for specific instructions on how to cook the cocaine into

crack.

     For example, during the call, Bing said, 'When the water

boils all the way hot, hot, hot . . .       Pour it in a      drop, right,

like a glass pot so you can see. Right. A little bit, like about,

like about an 8 inch high, you understand what I am saying.'

Later Bing said, 'Bake.. like 12 tell him to take 12 grams of

bako (baking powder) right, put it in the same bag with that

shake it up right and then like when he pours, when he pours the

inch water in another pot, tell him to put that joint, tell him

to put that, um put that um that stuff in the pot and stir it

right, stir it. Tell him do not put no more water in the pot,

tell him to stir it. Stir it, stir it, stir it.'          GILMORE then

said, 'Why don't you tell him that if he can't do I just wait.

I'd rather wait, I don't want to mess it up.'

                             II.   ARGUMENT

     Defendant should not be severed from the other co-defendants

in this case because GILMORE cannot meet his heavy burden of

making a “strong showing of prejudice” if forced to proceed to

trial with the other defendants.        United States v. Rawwad, 807

F.2d 294, 295 (1st Cir. 1985) (internal quotation marks and

citations omitted).    The First Circuit has repeatedly endorsed

the general rule that "persons who are indicted together should

be tried together."    United States v. O'Bryant, 998 F.2d 21, 25

(1st Cir. 1993).    That is because joint trials “promote

efficiency and serve the interests of justice.”          Zafiro v. United

States, 506 U.S. 534, 537 (1993) (internal quotation marks and

citation omitted).    The presumption in favor of joint trials is

particularly strong in conspiracy cases such as this one.             See

United States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 440 (1st Cir. 1994) ("In

the context of conspiracy, severance will rarely, if ever, be

required.") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted);

United States v. Perkins, 926 F.2d 1271, 1280 (1st Cir. 1991)

(“Co-conspirators are customarily tried together absent a strong

showing of prejudice.”).

     Accordingly, "[t]o obtain severance, [a defendant] must show

actual prejudice resulting from the joinder . . . not merely that

he would have a better chance of acquittal if” severance were


                                    5
   Case 1:05-cr-10239-RCL   Document 308    Filed 05/21/2007   Page 6 of 8



granted.    United States v. L'Allier, 838 F.2d 234, 241 (7th Cir.

1988).   "Actual prejudice means that the defendant could not have

a fair trial without severance."        United States v. Balzano, 916

F.2d 1273, 1281 (7th Cir. 1990).        Indeed, because of the strong

preference for joint trials, denial of a severance motion will be

reversed “only if the district court's decision deprived

defendant of a fair trial, resulting in a miscarriage of

justice."   United States v. Brennan, 994 U.S. 918, 924 (1st Cir.

1993) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); United

States v. Tejeda, 974 F.2d 212, 219 (1st Cir. 1992) (same).

     In this case, defendant has not overcome his burden of

demonstrating that a joint trial with the other co-defendants

will result in actual prejudice.        First, defendant's factual

characterization is incorrect. As indicated in the produced

discovery, including DEA 6 reports and wiretap affidavits,

GILMORE was present with Bing during one of the controlled

purchases of cocaine in October 2004.        Therefore, contrary to

defendant’s assertions, GILMORE's participation in the conspiracy

is certainly greater than a one month period.

     Second, GILMORE is not in an unique position.             While it is

true that his participation in the conspiracy was cut short by

his arrest in May 2005, GILMORE was also one of multiple

wholesale cocaine and crack cocaine customers who redistributed

the crack cocaine that Bing and Joyner sold on the streets of


                                    6
   Case 1:05-cr-10239-RCL   Document 308     Filed 05/21/2007   Page 7 of 8



Boston.   Therefore, a separate trial for GILMORE would require a

duplication of the evidence regarding the controlled purchases of

cocaine and crack cocaine, the authentication of the wiretap, and

other seizures of cocaine and crack cocaine that will demonstrate

the meaning of code/slang words like "grizze" and truncated

references to drug debt/price numbers which GILMORE, Bing, and

other conspirators utilized.

     Finally, defendant's argument that he may be forced to

endure a long trial is unavailing.         Motions to suppress are still

pending, and it still remains to be seen which, if any,

defendants will be seeking a trial.        Moreover, the case-law's

preference for a joint trial deals with the efficiencies of

judicial resources, not individual (albeit scare as well)

resources.

                            III.   Conclusion

     Accordingly, defendant’s motion for a severance should be

denied.
