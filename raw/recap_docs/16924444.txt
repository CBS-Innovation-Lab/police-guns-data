                                         SENTENCING ORDER

         Having pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of two firearms in violation of 18

U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), Michael Frappier was facing a Guideline range of incarceration of 46 to 57

months. This range resulted primarily because Mr. Frappier’s possession of one firearm began

on December 22, 1996, and the Guidelines required reaching back to 1986, capturing convictions

in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A further Guideline analysis reveals the proper application of

the Guidelines would mandate the imposition of sentence between 41 and 51 months. However,

in the narrow circumstances of this case, this Court concludes a statutory sentence of twenty

months more accurately reflects congressional sentencing policy consistent with 18 U.S.C. §

3553.

    I.   STATEMENT OF FACTS

         On January 3, 2005, Rosemarie Frappier reached her limit with her husband’s

recreational use of marijuana and called the police. The Penobscot County Sheriff’s Office

responded and with her consent, searched the Frappier home in Etna, Maine. In the closet in the

master bedroom, they came upon a bag of marijuana and marijuana stalks.1                            They also


1
  Mr. Frappier’s possession of marijuana did not result in any charges, presumably due to the small amount. Under
Maine state law, the possession of a usable amount of marijuana is a civil infraction. 22 M.R.S.A. § 2383(1). The
federal government could have prosecuted Mr. Frappier for misdemeanor possession, 21 U.S.C. § 844(a), but
elected not to do so.
Case 1:05-cr-00012-JAW Document 32 Filed 06/08/05 Page 2 of 11                                      PageID #: 66



discovered ammunition and two firearms: a New England Firearms .410 gauge shotgun, Pardner

Model, and a New Haven Mossberg .22 magnum caliber bolt action rifle, Model 740T. As a

convicted felon, Michael Frappier’s possession of firearms was a violation of federal law, 18

U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). The next day a Complaint was issued against him and on March 2, 2005,

Mr. Frappier pleaded guilty to a one count Information, charging a violation of § 922(g)(1).

    II.   DISCUSSION

          A. The Guideline Sentence

             1. Calculations Based On a January 3, 2005 Date of Offense

          The Guideline penalty for a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) is contained in U.S.S.G. §

2K2.1. This section provides an escalating range of penalties, depending in part upon the

Defendant’s criminal history. Although the prohibition against a felon possessing a firearm has

no time limit, the applicable provisions of U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1, which escalate the penalties, count

only those offenses committed within ten years of the “commencement of the instant offense.” 2

If the date of the offense in this case were January 3, 2005, the date the police discovered the

firearms, Mr. Frappier would have had no countable prior felonies and his offense level would

have been fixed at 14. With acceptance of responsibility, the offense level would drop to 12.

With a criminal history of I and a total offense level of 12, Mr. Frappier’s Guideline range of

sentence would have been 10 to 16 months.

             2. Commencement of the Offense


2
  Comment 12 to U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1 states:
          For purposes of applying subsection (a)(1), (2), (3), or (4)(A), use only those felony convictions that
          receive criminal history points under § 4A1.1(a), (b), or (c). In addition, for purposes of applying
          subsection (a)(1) and (a)(2), use only those felony convictions that are counted separately under § 4A1.1(a),
          (b), or (c).
U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1(a) is not applicable, since Mr. Frappier did not receive a prior sentence of imprisonment
exceeding one year and one month. The applicable provisions are § 4A1.1(b) and (c) and each contains a ten year
limitation on countable felonies for sentences “imposed more than ten years prior to the defendant’s commencement
of the instant offense.” U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1, Commentary 2, 3.


                                                          2
Case 1:05-cr-00012-JAW Document 32 Filed 06/08/05 Page 3 of 11                       PageID #: 67



       Mr. Frappier’s offense, however, did not commence on January 3, 2005. He first came

into possession of the .22 rifle in 2003, when a friend, Martin Flood, allowed Mr. Frappier’s son,

Anthony, then 12 years old, to borrow the .22 for target practice. Mr. Frappier kept the .22 for

Anthony, who was living full time with his mother.

       The shotgun is another story. He came into possession of the .410 shotgun on December

22, 1996, when he purchased it at Wal-Mart. When he did so, Mr. Frappier lied on the ATF

Form 4473, denying he had ever been convicted of a felony. Mr. Frappier bought the shotgun

for his older son, Daniel, then 10 years old, who was also living with his mother, but as with the

.22, Mr. Frappier retained possession of Daniel’s shotgun.

       The question is when Mr. Frappier’s violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) commenced

under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1, Application Notes 2, 3 (“A sentence imposed more than ten years prior

to the defendant’s commencement of the instant offense is not counted.”) (emphasis supplied).

Application Note 8 of U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2 explains that “commencement of the instant offense”

includes any relevant conduct.      See also U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).            Section

1B1.3(a)(1) requires the court to include as relevant conduct “all acts and omissions

committed…by defendant…that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in

preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for

that offense.” U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(a)(1)(A).

       There are two 2005 unpublished Sixth Circuit cases directly on point: United States v.

Oliver, No. 04-1309, 2005 WL 894584 (6th Cir. 2005) and United States v. Susewitt, No. 03-

6572, 2005 WL 611893 (6th Cir. 2005). In Oliver, the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court’s

determination that the date the defendant commenced a felon in possession offense was the date

he obtained the firearms, and in Susewitt, it affirmed a conclusion that the date the defendant




                                                 3
Case 1:05-cr-00012-JAW Document 32 Filed 06/08/05 Page 4 of 11                    PageID #: 68



commenced a possession of a sawed-off shotgun offense was the date he sawed off the barrel. In

each case, the earlier date led the sentencing court to capture earlier convictions that would

otherwise have been beyond the allowable time. The conclusions in Oliver and Susewitt are

consistent with other case law. See United States v. Kennedy, 32 F.3d 876, 890-91 (4th Cir.

1994) (drug offense commenced at the starting point of the conspiracy, not the date alleged in the

indictment), cert. denied sub. nom. Ingram v. United States, 513 U.S. 1128 (1995); United States

v. Rosenkrans, 236 F.3d 976, 977-78 (8th Cir. 2001) (relevant conduct for methamphetamine

dealer began when defendant began selling).

       Applying § 1B1.3’s definition of relevant conduct to § 4A1.1’s concept of

commencement, this Court concludes the date for commencement of the offense involving the

.22 took place in 2003, when Mr. Frappier came into possession of the rifle, and the date for

commencement of the offense involving the .410 shotgun took place on December 22, 1996,

when he made the illegal purchase. This conclusion is buttressed by the uncontroverted evidence

that once in possession, Mr. Frappier continuously retained possession of both firearms until the

date of discovery.

            3. Recalculation of the Guideline Range

       The conclusion that Mr. Frappier commenced his possession of the .22 in 2003 works no

untoward consequences for him; however, the conclusion that he commenced his possession of

the .410 shotgun on December 22, 1996 results in a significant change in his Guideline range of

sentence.   Mr. Frappier’s criminal history consists of the following:      1) a June 30, 1989

conviction for a February 6, 1989 Criminal Threatening with a Dangerous Weapon; 2) a 1990

conviction for a 1990 Operating Under the Influence; and, 3) September 4, 1991 convictions for

May 26, 1991 offenses of Eluding an Officer and Operating After Suspension. Capturing these

Case 1:05-cr-00012-JAW Document 32 Filed 06/08/05 Page 5 of 11                      PageID #: 69



three prior convictions affects both Mr. Frappier’s criminal history classification and his § 2K2.1

offense level. Mr. Frappier’s criminal history classification increases to III and his total offense

level rises to 24. With a three level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, his total offense

level is 21. A Criminal History Category III and a total offense level 21, the sentencing range

jumps to 46 to 57 months.

            4. Criminal History Category: U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3

       Under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3, the sentencing court may alter a defendant’s criminal history

category if it concludes “that a defendant’s criminal history category significantly over-

represents the seriousness of a defendant’s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant

will commit further crimes.” U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3(b)(1). Considering the nature of these three prior

offenses, this Court cannot conclude a Criminal History Category III over-represents the

seriousness of his prior crimes. Criminal Threatening with a Dangerous Weapon, Eluding an

Officer, and Operating Under the Influence are manifestly serious offenses; two are crimes of

violence.

       On the other hand, Defendant makes a more telling point when he argues that his criminal

history over-represents his likelihood of recidivism. Section 4A1.3 departures are “encouraged”

under Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81 (1996); United States v. Wilkerson, 183 F. Supp. 2d

373, 380 (D. Mass. 2002). A criminal history departure is distinct from a departure under §

5K2.0, which requires the existence of “an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or

to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission.” United

States v. Woodley, 344 F. Supp. 2d 274, 277 n.4; Wilkerson, 183 F. Supp. 2d at 380. This Court

does not have to find there is “something atypical or unusual about the defendant’s record.”

Woodley, 344 F. Supp. 2d at 277.




                                                 5
Case 1:05-cr-00012-JAW Document 32 Filed 06/08/05 Page 6 of 11                    PageID #: 70



       Considerations include the nature of the offenses that resulted in prior convictions,

United States v. Footman, 66 F. Supp. 2d 83, 99 (D. Mass. 1999), aff’d, 215 F.3d 145 (1st Cir.

2000), and the “defendant’s record in the context of his life and background.” Wilkerson, 183 F.

Supp. 2d at 380. Relevant factors are the defendant’s age at the time of the prior offenses,

whether the crimes were violent or non-violent, how close in time the prior offenses were, and

the length of the prior sentences. See Woodley, 344 F. Supp. 2d at 278.

       Here, the analysis is something of a mixed bag. Mr. Frappier’s Category III results from

a criminal history point score of 4, tipping him into the higher category. His crimes, as earlier

noted, were serious and some were violent. Criminal Threatening with a Dangerous Weapon is

particularly disturbing, since the current charge is possession of firearms.      However, Mr.

Frappier is now 43 years old and the three countable convictions took place between February 6,

1989 and May 26, 1991, when he was between 26 and 29 years old. The relative temporal

compression of these offenses indicates more of a crime spree than a defendant engaging in a life

of crime. None of the prior sentences was lengthy: thirty days for the 1989 conviction, forty-

eight hours for the 1990 OUI, and sixty days for the 1991 convictions. He has one uncounted

conviction in 1999 for Operating After Suspension, resulting in a ten day jail sentence.

Otherwise, he had no prior or subsequent brushes with the law until January 3, 2005.

       Following these convictions he remained employed in the concrete business, and at the

sentencing hearing, a number of friends and business acquaintances spoke on his behalf. His

motivation for possessing the two firearms was solely to teach his children how to operate rifles

and there is no indication of any improper use. The police came to know of his violation of law

for reasons unrelated to his possession of a firearm.       His post-offense conduct has been

exemplary.




                                                6
Case 1:05-cr-00012-JAW Document 32 Filed 06/08/05 Page 7 of 11                     PageID #: 71



       To his detriment, he has admitted to using marijuana and failing to keep up with child

support payments.     However, on balance, in light of the length of time since his prior

convictions, his continued employment, his parental motivation in possessing the firearms, and

the absence of any interaction with the law for the last five years, the inclusion of these three

older convictions, in this Court’s view, over-represents the likelihood he will commit further

crimes and justifies a lower classification. Given the seriousness of his earlier crimes, his

uncounted conviction, his continued marijuana use, and his failure to pay all child support, this

Court could not conclude that the risk of recidivism dropped to a Category I, where the person

either has no prior record or only one prior conviction. Instead, this Court concluded that a

Category II was a more accurate reflection of Mr. Frappier’s likelihood of recidivism.

           5. Recalculation at Category II

       The recalculation of the sentencing range for Mr. Frappier at Category II does not result

in a marked change in his sentencing range under the Guidelines. With an offense level of 21

and a Criminal History Category II, the Guideline range of sentence is 41 to 51 months.

       B. The Statutory Sentence: 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)

       Relying on United States v. Booker, __U.S.__, 125 S.Ct. 738 (2004), Mr. Frappier urges

this Court to conclude that the Guideline sentencing range of 41 to 51 months would be

manifestly inconsistent with the congressional sentencing directives set forth in 18 U.S.C. §

3553, which requires the sentencing courts to “impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than

necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in paragraph 2.” 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). Section

3553(a)(2) states that such purposes include the need:

           (A)      to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and
                    to provide just punishment for the offense;
           (B)      to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;
           (C)      to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and,



                                                7
Case 1:05-cr-00012-JAW Document 32 Filed 06/08/05 Page 8 of 11                     PageID #: 72



           (D)       to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training,
                     medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner.

Section 3553(a) also instructs the sentencing courts to consider: (1) the nature and circumstances

of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence

imposed to be based on the purposes described above; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4)

the sentencing range established by the guidelines; (5) any pertinent policy statements issued by

the Sentencing Commission; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among

defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and, (7) the need

to provide restitution to any victims of the offense. Judge Adelman grouped these factors into

three categories: the nature of the offense; the history and character of the defendant; and, the

needs of the public and any victims of the crime. United States v. Galvez-Barrios, 355 F. Supp.

2d 958, 960 (E.D. Wis. 2005).

          1.     Nature of the Offense

       It is beyond argument that Congress considers the possession of a firearm by a convicted

felon to be a most serious offense. Statutory penalties are rigorous and the more egregious cases

can require the imposition of mandatory minimums and lengthy prison terms, some times

consecutive to the sentences imposed on underlying crimes. See generally 18 U.S.C. § 924.

There are, nevertheless, several considerations uniquely applicable to Mr. Frappier’s case.

       First, his sole motivation in possessing the firearms was to do for his sons what his father

had done for him: teach them how to use a rifle. There is no evidence he ever actually used

either firearm, except firing the firearms from five to six times while instructing them in the

operation and safety of the weapons. His older son, Daniel, is currently applying this knowledge

as a member of the United States Army about to be shipped to Iraq.




                                                8
Case 1:05-cr-00012-JAW Document 32 Filed 06/08/05 Page 9 of 11                     PageID #: 73



       Second, the uncontradicted evidence of his motivation compels the ancillary conclusion

that he did not possess the weapon for any illegal purpose. Apart from his status offense, he

never perpetrated a crime with either weapon and even though his wife and he had a difficult,

sometimes rancorous relationship, there is no evidence he ever used or threatened to use either

firearm against her. There is no evidence he even went hunting with either weapon or ever used

either weapon outside the presence of his sons.

       Third, the weapons are standard hunting weapons: a .22 rifle and a .410 shotgun. The

firearms were not weapons commonly used in the perpetration of crime or traded for drugs.

They were rifles, not handguns; they were not high caliber rifles; they were not assault weapons.

In short, the type of weapons was consistent with Mr. Frappier’s version of his motivation in

their possession.

       Fourth, Mr. Frappier’s possession of the weapons was discovered for reasons other than

his use.   When Mrs. Frappier complained to the police, she did not complain about his

possession of firearms; she instead complained about his use of marijuana. The police found the

firearms when they were looking for something else.

       Fifth, but for the length of time since his 1996 purchase of the shotgun, Mr. Frappier

would have been facing between 10 and 16 months incarceration, instead of 41 to 51 months.

       Sixth, rather than support a lengthier sentence, the passage of time from 1996 without

incident, substantiates his contention that his possession of the shotgun was benign and deserving

of a less stringent, not more stringent sentence.

           2.   History and Character of the Defendant

       Mr. Frappier presents a mixed picture. His prior criminal history, his lying on a federal

firearms form, his persistent use of marijuana, his failure to pay court-ordered child support, and




                                                    9
Case 1:05-cr-00012-JAW Document 32 Filed 06/08/05 Page 10 of 11                     PageID #: 74



his ongoing illegal possession of firearms do not recommend him.           Yet, at the sentencing

hearing, nine people came forward to speak for him, ranging from friends and family to business

associates. They spoke of a person who is hard working, kind, considerate, and responsible.

There is evidence that supports their view. Mr. Frappier has worked construction for the last

twenty years and in 2004, he began his own concrete business. Although his failure to pay child

support is troubling, his son, Anthony, is obviously devoted to him and testified at the sentencing

hearing for his father. Other individuals attested to his willingness to help them out without

being asked and without expectation of compensation. Finally, Mr. Frappier has done extremely

well since his arrest. He has been subjected to random drug testing and has remained drug free

while on bail; he has also participated regularly in drug counseling.

          3.   The Needs of the Public and Any Victims

       Mr. Frappier’s crime has no direct victims. There are, however, public interests. One

interest is to deter him from committing further crimes.         Although Mr. Frappier’s use of

marijuana and failure to pay child support evidence a somewhat cavalier attitude toward the law,

it is this Court’s impression, having had the opportunity to evaluate Mr. Frappier in person, that

he is not likely to engage in future criminal conduct. His more serious criminal conduct occurred

nearly 15 years ago and, upon arrest in this case, he has been scrupulously compliant with bail

conditions.

       A more significant issue is whether a sentence outside the Guideline range would violate

the need for uniformity in sentencing among similarly situated defendants. Here, the Court has

been influenced by the impact the Guideline’s definition of the commencement of the offense,

reaching back over a long period of comparative quiescence to gather in criminal convictions

that would ordinarily be beyond time. In the appropriate case, where the defendant’s history




                                                10
Case 1:05-cr-00012-JAW Document 32 Filed 06/08/05 Page 11 of 11                     PageID #: 75



justifies such a long reach, this Court will not hesitate to apply it. However, here, where Mr.

Frappier’s eight years of intervening possession of the firearm substantiates no improper use, this

Court concludes the policies underlying U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1’s incorporation of the relevant

conduct definition in U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3(b)(1) are outweighed by the statutory directive to tailor

the sentence to the individual defendant. Moreover, if not for the application of § 4A1.1, the

comparable class of similarly situation defendants would be those receiving between 10 and 16

months incarceration.

III.   CONCLUSION

       This Court concludes the congressional sentencing policies reflected in 18 U.S.C. §

3553(a) are more effectively carried out in this case by imposing a sentence outside the

Guideline range of sentence and this Court sentences this Defendant to 20 months incarceration.
