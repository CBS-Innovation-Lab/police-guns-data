                          MEMORANDUM AND ORDER

WILLIAM E. SMITH, Chief Judge.

     Pending   before    the     Court   is   Petitioner   Laron    Paschal’s

second Motion for Relief from Judgment or Order pursuant to Fed.

R. Civ. P. 60(b).       (ECF No. 80.)         This motion, like Paschal’s

first Rule 60(b) motion, seeks relief from the Court’s February

2009 Memorandum and Order denying Paschal’s motion to vacate,

set aside, or correct sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255. 1

Because   Paschal’s     second    Rule   60(b)   motion    constitutes   yet

another second or successive motion to vacate under § 2255, the

motion is DENIED and his application under § 2255 is DISMISSED.

I.   Background

     In May 2006, Paschal pled guilty to possessing a firearm

after having been convicted of a felony, in violation of 18

     1
       This Court determined that Paschal’s first Rule 60(b)
motion was a second or successive motion to vacate or set aside
a conviction under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.    As a result, the Court
denied that motion. (ECF No. 71.)
U.S.C.      §    922(g)(1),        and    to   possessing     heroin      with    intent      to

distribute,          in   violation       of   21    U.S.C.   §     841(a)(1).          At    the

sentencing hearing, this Court determined that Paschal had four

predicate convictions that qualified him to be sentenced under

the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1) (“ACCA”),

and     sentenced         Paschal        to    the    statutory         mandatory    minimum

sentence of 15 years. 2                Two of the predicate convictions related

to drug offenses and the other two involved charges related to

entering a dwelling with felonious intent.                          Paschal’s conviction

and    sentence       were    summarily        affirmed.       See      United    States       v.

Paschal, No. 06-2649 (1st Cir. Feb. 19, 2008).

       Thereafter, Paschal filed his first motion to vacate, set

aside, or correct sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255, arguing

that       his   trial      counsel      was   ineffective        and    that    there       were

insufficient predicate offenses to justify his sentence under

the    ACCA.         (ECF    No.       54.)    According      to    Paschal,      his    trial

counsel failed to investigate the predicate offenses relied upon

by the government.              Had he done so, Paschal argued, his counsel

would       have     discovered         that   two    of    those    offenses       were      not

predicate offenses at all under the ACCA.                           Paschal focused his

attack on one of the drug offenses and one of the offenses

related         to   entering      a    dwelling     with   felonious      intent.           This

       2
       Under the ACCA, the Court was required to determine that
Paschal had three previous convictions for “a violent felony or
a serious drug offense.” See 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1).
                                                2
Court     denied     Paschal’s      application,          holding     that     Paschal’s

counsel was sufficient and that three of Paschal’s underlying

convictions satisfied the predicate offense requirements of the

ACCA. 3   (ECF No. 62.)

      Now,       Paschal   advances     a    modified         version    of     the    same

argument     he    previously     presented        –   that     his   convictions       for

entering     a    dwelling   with    felonious         intent    cannot     serve      as    a

predicate offense following a recent Supreme Court decision.

II.   Discussion

      Paschal has styled his motion as a Motion for Relief from

Judgment or Order pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).                          But a Rule

60(b) motion “that principally challenges the constitutionality

of a habeas petitioner's underlying conviction should be treated

as a second or successive habeas petition.”                           Munoz v. United

States,    331     F.3d    151,   152   (1st       Cir.    2003).       A     motion    may

properly be considered under Rule 60(b) where it focuses on a

procedural irregularity in the § 2255 proceeding.                       Id.

      Here, Paschal’s motion attacks the constitutionality of his

underlying        conviction,     and       thus       must     be    treated     as        an

application under § 2255.               Because this constitutes Paschal’s


      3
        While litigating Paschal’s first § 2255 motion, the
Government conceded that one of the drug offenses was not in
fact a predicate offense under the ACCA. Still, under the ACCA,
a defendant need only have three predicate offenses to face a
mandatory minimum of 15 years in prison.      See 18 U.S.C. §
924(e)(1).
                                            3
third     motion   under         §     2255,   this     Court      lacks    jurisdiction    to

address his motion.              In pertinent part, § 2255 provides that:

      A second or successive motion must be certified as
      provided in section 2244 4 by a panel of the appropriate
      court of appeals to contain—

           (1) newly discovered evidence that, if proven and
           viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be
           sufficient to establish by clear and convincing
           evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have
           found the movant guilty of the offense; or

           (2)   a  new   rule  of   constitutional  law,  made
           retroactive to cases on collateral review by the
           Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.

28 U.S.C. § 2255(h); see also United States v. Rivera-Lebron,

410   F.   App'x       352,      354    (1st    Cir.    2011)      (describing      the    pre-

clearance       step    as       the    “gate-keeping         requirement[]        of   section

2255.”).         Paschal         may    apply     for       permission      from   the    First

Circuit Court of Appeals to bring the instant petition.                                    But

where,     as    here,       a       petitioner       has    not    first    obtained     that

permission from the Court of Appeals, the district court lacks

jurisdiction to hear the second or successive motion.                               See, e.g.

United States v. Cao, CR. No. 05-134-4-ML, 2013 WL 1130958, at

*2 (D.R.I. Mar. 18, 2013).




      4
       In relevant part, 28 U.S.C. § 2244 provides that: “Before
a second or successive application permitted by this section is
filed in the district court, the applicant shall move in the
appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the
district court to consider the application.”          28 U.S.C.
§ 2244(b)(3)(A).
                                                  4
     For the foregoing reasons, Paschal’s Motion for Relief from

Judgment or Order to vacate is DENIED, and his motion to set

aside,   or   correct   sentence   is   DISMISSED,   without   prejudice

subject to re-filing if the First Circuit Court of Appeals gives

Paschal permission to do so.



IT IS SO ORDERED.
