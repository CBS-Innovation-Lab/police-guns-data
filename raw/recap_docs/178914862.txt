12                MAGISTRATE JUDGE’S REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
                                RE: AMENDMENT 782
13
14
             This is an initial determination as to eligibility for the drug reduction
15
     amendment promulgated by the United States Sentencing Commission under
16
17   Amendment 782 to Policy Statement § 1B1.10(d).

18           After careful review of the defendant’s presentence report, charging
19
     document(s), plea agreement (if any), judgment and statement of reasons, I
20
     recommend as follows:
21
22           [ X ] The defendant is not eligible for a sentence reduction based on the

23   following factor(s):
24
                   [ ] A. The guidelines range that applied in this case was
25                 not determined under one of the guidelines affected by
                   the amendment (2D1.1, 2D1.2, 2D1.5, 2D1.6, 2D1.8,
26
                   2D1.10, 2D1.11, and 2D1.14), or the drug guideline was
27                 initially used but a cross reference to other guideline was

                triggered, resulting in a total offense level determined
 4              based on the cross referenced guideline.
 5
                [ X ] B. The defendant was sentenced to a statutory
 6              mandated minimum imprisonment term. The defendant
 7              did not comply with the safety valve provisions and did
                not receive a reduction of his or her imprisonment term
 8              based on a departure for substantial assistance or a Rule
 9              35 motion subsequent to the original sentence.

10
                [ ] C. The defendant’s final and total base offense level
11               was derived from the career offender or the career criminal
                 guideline.
12
13             [ ] D. The base offense level was 43 or 38 based on
              2D1.1(a)(1) or (2) as the defendant was convicted of a drug
14
             violation and the offense of conviction established that death or
15           serious bodily injury resulted from the use of the substance and
             the defendant committed the offense after one or more prior
16
             convictions for a similar crime.
17
18            [ ] E. The base offense level was 12 or lower and the case
               involved heroin, cocaine, cocaine base, PCP,
19             methamphetamine, amphetamine, LSD or fentanyl.
20
             [ ] F. The base offense level was 8 or lower and the offense
21           involved flunitrazepam.
22
               [ ] G. The base offense level was 6 or lower and the offense
23           involved marijuana, hashish, ketamine, Schedule I or II
24          Depressants, Schedule III Hydrocodone, Schedule III Substances
             (other than Ketamine and Hydrocodone), Schedule IV Substances
25          (except flunitrazepam), or Schedule V Substances.
26
              [ ] H. The Court determined the base offense level by using either
27           of the quantity tables at U.S.S.G. § 2D1.11 and the base offense level
28           was 12 or lower.

 4        Since a determination of ineligibility has been made, the matter is formally
 5 submitted to the Presiding District Court Judge. The Federal Public Defender or
   Defense Counsel has 10 days to object to the initial assessment of ineligibility.
 6 After the 10-day period, and in the absence of an objection by defense counsel, the
 7 Presiding District Court Judge may rule on the motion for reduction of sentence and
   may adopt the recommendation of the Magistrate Judge.
 8
 9       [ ] The defendant may be eligible for a sentence reduction and therefore
   the matter is referred to a United States District Judge. (The Presiding Judicial
10
   Officer shall wait for the Parties’ stipulation within 14 days, and if no stipulation is
11 reached within this term, to await for the United States Probation Office, the
   Federal Public Defender and the Government’s memoranda within 14 days
12
   thereafter).
13
         I therefore recommend that the motion for reduction of sentence (Docket
14
15 No. 2366) not be considered by the Court since the defendant is not eligible for
16
     sentence reduction since he received a minimum statutory sentence of 120 months.
