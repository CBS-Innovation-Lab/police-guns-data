                         ORDER AFFIRMING THE
              RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE


       The United States Magistrate Judge filed with the Court on June 30, 2014, his Recommended

Decision (ECF No. 181). Petitioner filed his Objection to the Recommended Decision (ECF No.

182) on July 21, 2014. Petitioner filed a Supplemental Objection to the Recommended Decision

(ECF No. 183) on August 5, 2014.

       I have reviewed and considered the Magistrate Judge's Recommended Decision, together

with the entire record; I have made a de novo determination of all matters adjudicated by the

Magistrate Judge's Recommended Decision; and I concur with the recommendations of the United

States Magistrate Judge for the reasons set forth in his Recommended Decision, and determine that

no further proceeding is necessary.

       1.       It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the Magistrate Judge
                is hereby AFFIRMED.

       2.       It is hereby ORDERED that Petitioner’s Section 2255 Motion (ECF No. 180) is
                DISMISSED.
       3.     It is hereby ORDERED that a certificate of appealability shall not be issued because
              there is no substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right within the
              meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).
