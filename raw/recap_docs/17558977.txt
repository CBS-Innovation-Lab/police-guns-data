WILLIAM E. SMITH, United States District Judge.

     Juan Forbes has filed a motion to vacate, set aside or

correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 in the above-

captioned matter.     For the reasons that follow the motion is

DENIED.

I.   FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND TRAVEL

     On November 15, 2006, a federal grand jury in the District

of Rhode Island returned a five-count indictment against Forbes.

Count I charged that Forbes conspired to distribute 50 grams or

more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and

(b)(1)(A) and 21 U.S.C. § 846.         Count II charged Forbes with

distribution of 50 grams or more of cocaine base, in violation

of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A).         Counts III, IV and V

charged   Forbes   with   possessing   a   firearm   after   having   been

convicted of a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).
              Forbes was represented by Federal Defender Edward C. Roy

for           all            proceedings                         in   this     Court,    which   proceedings      were

conducted before Judge Ernest C. Torres.

              On December 7, 2006, the Government filed an information

pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 851(a) (ECF No. 7) alleging that Forbes

had one prior felony drug conviction. 1                                                  An attached copy of the

state                court                judgment                showed     a     conviction    for    Manufacture/

Delivery/Possession                                            with   Intent      to   Deliver   a     Schedule   I/II

Controlled Substance in Providence Superior Court in 2004, for

which Forbes was sentenced to five years imprisonment, one year

to serve and four years suspended.2                                                 Forbes did not challenge the

§ 851 information, as permitted under § 851(c).

              On February 16, 2007, Forbes pled guilty to the substantive
                                                                                                                     3
drug charge and the three firearms charges (Counts II - V).

There was no plea agreement.                                                     At the change of plea hearing

Forbes acknowledged that he had a prior felony drug trafficking

conviction and that he faced a mandatory minimum sentence of 20
                                                            
              1
       The effect of the § 851 information here was to increase
the applicable mandatory minimum sentence for the drug offenses
charged from ten years to twenty years.       See 21 U.S.C. §
841(b)(1)(A).
              2
        An accompanying charge of conspiracy to possess and
distribute drugs was dismissed in that state proceeding.    See
Request to Enter Plea in State v. Forbes, P2/04-2390A, attached
to § 851 Information.
              3
       The Government dismissed the conspiracy count (Count I) at
sentencing.


                                                                             2
 
years.                   (See Change of Plea Hr’g Tr. 8-9, 12, 14-15, Feb. 16,

2007 [“Plea Tr.”].)

              Counsel                    for            Forbes    filed       a    motion      for   issuance    of   a

subpoena pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c), seeking evidence

that might support a claim of racial bias in the Government’s

§ 851 information filing practices. 4                                                The Government opposed the

motion.                      At a hearing on the motion, Attorney Roy cited news

reports of more than 100 drug arrests and subsequent state and

federal prosecutions resulting from a law enforcement operation

known                as          “Operation                    Crackdown,”         and   he     sought   information

concerning the race of those defendants who were and were not

selected for federal prosecution and of those defendants who

were the subject of § 851 informations.                                                       The Court denied the

motion.

              Shortly thereafter, defense counsel also filed a motion to

dismiss the § 851 information (ECF No. 19) on the basis that the

prior                conviction                         listed    should          have   been    included   in    the

indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.                                                     The Government

objected to the motion.                                          After hearing, at which Forbes did not




                                                            
              4
       Counsel had previously filed a motion to dismiss the
indictment or “strike the mandatory minimum sentence” on the
ground that Forbes had been selectively prosecuted due to his
race (ECF No. 13) but then subsequently withdrew that motion.
(ECF No. 14.)
 

                                                                          3
 
dispute the existence of his prior conviction, the Court denied

the motion.

        The Presentence Report (PSR) calculated a guideline range

of 121 - 151 months but noted that the range was preempted by

the mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years made applicable as a

result of the filing of the § 851 information.                   (PSR ¶¶ 9, 24,

36, 40, 58.)     Although Forbes’ prior felony drug conviction was

noted    therein,   he   did    not   file      any    objections     to   the   PSR.

Forbes also acknowledged his prior conviction in a presentence

letter to the Court.            (See undated letter of Juan Forbes to

‘Your Honor’ at 2, attached to PSR.)

        At the sentencing hearing on June 7, 2007, Judge Torres

inquired as to the Government’s reasons for filing the § 851

information in this case.         (See Sentencing Hr’g Tr. 4-5, June 7,

2007 [“Sent. Tr.”].)           The Government’s attorney explained that

the   information    was   filed      in       light   of   Forbes’    prior     drug

conviction, its understanding that Forbes was the leader of an

ongoing conspiracy (which competed with other groups) to sell

drugs and guns, and the fact that Forbes had pled guilty to

selling three guns.      (Id. at 5.)

        The Court imposed the mandatory minimum sentence of twenty

years imprisonment on the drug offense (Count II) and ten years

imprisonment on each of the gun offenses (Counts III - V), all

to run concurrently, followed by up to ten years of supervised

                                           4
 
release.                      (Id. at 14-15.)                        Prior to imposing sentence, the Court

did not specifically inquire of Forbes whether he affirmed or

denied the prior conviction alleged in the § 851 information,

nor            did            it          inform               Forbes   that    any    challenge    to     a    prior

conviction                        which               was      not   made     before   sentencing    may       not    be

raised                afterwards                         to    attack   the    sentence.     See    21   U.S.C.       §

851(b) (providing that such inquiry and disclosure be made after

conviction but before sentencing).

              Forbes appealed his conviction, represented by new counsel,

Attorney Jeffrey W. Langholtz. 5                                             He argued that his sentence was

in error because of the district court’s failure to comply with

the 21 U.S.C. § 851(b) colloquy requirement, as noted above.                                                         He

also argued for a rejection of the ‘prior conviction exception’

stated                 in         Almendarez-Torres                     v.    United   States,     523   U.S.        224

(1998).                    The First Circuit found that the failure to conduct the

§ 851(b) colloquy was not plain error and summarily affirmed

Forbes’ conviction and sentence on January 9, 2009.                                                            United

States v. Forbes, No. 07-1971, slip op. at 1 (1st Cir. Jan. 9,

2009).




                                                            
              5
       Forbes has not asserted any claims in this proceeding
against his appellate counsel.


                                                                         5
 
              Thereafter, Forbes filed the instant motion to vacate. 6                                         In

his motion he claims that his counsel was ineffective because

he: (1) failed to investigate his prior state court conviction;

(2) failed to object to the omission of the colloquy pursuant to

21 U.S.C. § 851(b); and (3) failed to object to the § 851

enhancement                           on          the           grounds    that   Forbes’   prior   state   court

conviction involved a conspiracy and did not involve 50 grams or

more of narcotics.                                             The Government has filed an objection to the

motion to vacate, and this matter is ready for decision.7

II.           DISCUSSION

              A.             General Principles

              The grounds justifying relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 8 are

limited                     to           instances                  when    the   court     finds   a   lack   of

                                                            
              6
       With his motion Forbes filed a Memorandum of Law (“Pet’r’s
Mem.”)   with   attached  documentation   concerning  his   prior
conviction.
              7
       No hearing is required in connection with any issues
raised by this motion to vacate, because, as discussed infra,
the files and records of this case conclusively establish that
his claims are without merit.  See David v. United States, 134
F.3d 470, 477 (1st Cir. 1998) (holding that district court
properly may forego any hearing “when . . . the movant's
allegations need not be accepted as true because they state
conclusions instead of facts, contradict the record, or are
inherently  incredible”)  (internal  quotations  and  citation
omitted).

miscarriage of justice.”) (internal citation and quotation marks

omitted).                          Although claims of sentencing errors are generally

not           cognizable                         in          a        §        2255             proceeding                          absent                 ”exceptional

circumstances,” claims of ineffective assistance of counsel with

respect                  to         sentencing                        are           not           subject                  to         this             hurdle.                        See

Knight v. United States, 37 F.3d 769, 773-74 (1st Cir. 1994).

              The           Sixth               Amendment                       grants                each             defendant                       the           right               to

effective assistance of counsel.                                                                        To succeed on an ineffective

assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner must demonstrate:

              (1)            That his counsel’s performance fell below an objective
                             standard of reasonableness; and
              (2)            [A] reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s
                             unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding
                             would have been different.

to the Court’s failure to conduct the colloquy required under 21

existence of the prior conviction in any event, defense counsel

was not deficient for failing to challenge Forbes’ plea on this

basis.                  Moreover, Forbes has not made any showing that he would

not have pleaded guilty had the sentencing court conducted the §

851 colloquy or that he was otherwise prejudiced as a result of

counsel’s failure to challenge the sentencing court’s omission.

See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 692.

              raised to attack the sentence.
              10
        The First Circuit’s rejection of this claim on direct
appeal forecloses Forbes’ attempt here (Pet’r’s Mem. 15-16) to
assert a direct claim based on the sentencing court’s failure to
conduct the § 851 colloquy. See Singleton v. United States, 26
F.3d 233, 240 (1st Cir. 1994) (“issues disposed of in a prior
appeal will not be reviewed again by way of a 28 U.S.C. § 2255
motion”) (internal quotations and citation omitted); Argencourt

            2.        Failure to Investigate and Challenge Sufficiency
                      of Prior Conviction

     Forbes next claims that his counsel was ineffective for

failing    to    independently      investigate       and    challenge    his   prior

state court conviction.            He contends that had counsel reviewed

the records of that prior conviction, those records would have

shown errors in the acceptance of his plea, so as to render the

conviction invalid for § 851 purposes.                  (Mot. to Vacate, Ground

Two; Pet’r’s Mem. 7-8.)

     This       claim    fails    for   several      reasons.       First,      Forbes

admitted    to    the     existence     of    his    prior   offense     on   several

occasions at his plea and sentencing, and thus his counsel had

no duty to investigate it.              See Easley v. United States, Nos. C

07-4110-MWB, CR 05-4107-MWB, 2009 WL 2960768, at *8 (N.D. Iowa

Sept. 14, 2009) (“Because there was no flaw in the § 851 Notice,

and because [the defendant] had admitted to his counsel that he

had committed the prior offense identified in the § 851 Notice,

counsel did not perform deficiently by refusing to assert a

frivolous objection to the § 851 enhancement.”).

     Second,      a     prior    conviction    may    not    be   challenged     at   a

subsequent federal sentencing on grounds other than a violation

of the right to counsel.            Custis v. United States, 511 U.S. 485,

489 (1994); See also Mateo v. United States, 398 F.3d 126, 133-

34 & n.7 (1st Cir. 2005) (applying Custis holding).                       Here, the


                                          10
 
record shows that Forbes was represented by counsel at his prior

state conviction.                                          (See PSR ¶ 36.) Thus, Attorney Roy was not

deficient                      in         failing               to    investigate      the    adequacy      of   Forbes'

prior conviction as a predicate for the § 851 enhancement here,

when Supreme Court case law precluded such a challenge.11

              Even              apart                 from        these   general          considerations,        Forbes’

claims of ineffective assistance regarding specific aspects of

his counsel’s representation are without merit.

                                            a.             Nature of Prior Conviction and Drug Quantity
                                                           Involved

              Forbes claims that his counsel was ineffective in failing

to         object                 to         the           §    851   enhancement          because   the    prior      drug

conviction (a) involved a conspiracy (Mot. to Vacate, Ground

Three; Pet’r’s Mem. 12-13) and (b) did not involve 50 grams or

more of narcotics.                                             (Mot. to Vacate, Ground Four; Pet’r’s Mem.

17-20.) 12                     As to the first asserted ground, the record shows that

Forbes’                   prior                drug            conviction      in    state     court    was      not    for

conspiracy,                            but            for        possession         with    intent     to   deliver       a


                                                            
              11
       As discussed infra, in order to challenge the use of this
prior conviction in connection with his federal sentence, Forbes
would first need to successfully apply to the state court to
overturn his state conviction. See Custis, 511 U.S. at 489.
              12
        It is unclear whether Forbes’ arguments concerning the
dismissal of the conspiracy charge and the quantity of drugs
pertain to his predicate offense or to the instant offense. To
the extent that these   claims pertain to the offenses that are
the subject of the instant case, they are discussed infra.


                                                                          11
 
controlled substance.                                            (See PSR ¶ 36.)      The state conspiracy

charge                  was             dismissed                at   Forbes’    sentencing   on   the   drug

distribution charge.                                           (See PSR ¶ 36.)   Thus, this claim is based

on a mistaken factual premise and fails.13

              Likewise, Forbes’ claim that because his predicate state

offense did not involve 50 grams or more of cocaine base, it

could not be used to enhance his current sentence is equally

misguided.                            There is no requirement under either § 851 or §

841(b)(1) that a prior drug conviction used to enhance a federal

sentence for a subsequent drug offense involve a minimum amount

of drugs.                            By its terms the enhanced penalty provision of §

841(b)(1)(A) applies to “a prior conviction for a felony drug

offense.” 14                          Here, as part of his prior drug conviction, Forbes

was sentenced to five years imprisonment for possession with

intent to deliver a controlled substance.                                              (PSR ¶ 36.)       Thus,


                                                            
              13
        Forbes’ invocation of 28 U.S.C. § 994(h) in connection
with this point is misguided.      That provision requires the
United   States  Sentencing  Commission  to  assure   that  the
guidelines specify a sentence “at or near the maximum term
authorized” for defendants who were convicted of certain felony
drug offenses. The provision does not trump the mandatory
minimum penalties set forth in 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A) for
repeat drug offenders.
              14
        A ‘felony drug offense’ is defined “an offense that is
punishable by imprisonment for more than one year under any law
of the United States or of a State or foreign country that
prohibits or restricts conduct relating to narcotic drugs,
marihuana, anabolic steroids, or depressants or stimulant
substances.” 21 U.S.C. § 802(44).


                                                                        12
 
that conviction was unquestionably a felony drug offense that

could     properly       be    the     subject       of    the   government’s          §        851

information.

                    b.        State Court Plea Colloquy

       Forbes     further          claims    that    his    state     court         conviction

should not have been used to enhance his sentence because he was

not advised by the state sentencing court that the conviction

could be used to enhance Forbes’ future sentences. (Pet’r’s Mem.

7.)       However,       “a        plea’s    possible      enhancing          effect       on    a

subsequent sentence is merely a collateral consequence of the

conviction; it is not the type of consequence about which a

defendant must be advised before the defendant enters the plea.”

Wright v. United States, 624 F.2d 557, 561 (5th Cir. 1980); See

also    United    States       v.    Campusano,      947    F.2d    1,    4-5       (1st    Cir.

1991); McCarthy v. United States, 320 F.3d 1230, 1234 (11th Cir.

2003) (citing Wright); Steele v. Murphy, 365 F.3d 14, 17 (1st

Cir. 2004) (noting that defendant need only be advised of direct

consequences of his plea rather than collateral consequences).

Neither    the    state       sentencing        judge      nor   Forbes’       counsel          was

constitutionally required to make him aware of such a remote,

collateral       consequence,          and    the    failure     to      do    so    did        not

preclude    the    use        of    that     prior   drug    conviction         to     enhance

Forbes’ sentence here.

              In short, Forbes has failed to demonstrate either deficient

performance by his counsel or prejudice with respect to the §

851 information.                                        See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688. The record

shows that Attorney Roy filed two pretrial motions challenging

the            government’s                              §      851   information       and     argued      extensively

against the enhancement at three different hearings.                                                             The fact

that             he         was           not           successful        does    not     render     his    performance
                               15
deficient.                                  See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 699 (so long as a

strategy                    or         tactic                  employed   by     counsel    was      reasonable,     that

tactic                  is           not             a         ground     for    attack       even    if    it     proved

unsuccessful).                                     Moreover,            Forbes    admitted     to     his   prior    drug

felony conviction on several occasions during the proceedings.

See Betterton v. United States, Nos. C 07-3014-MWB, CR 03-3014

MWB, 2009 WL 2255768, at *19 (N.D. Iowa July 27, 2009) (“Where a

defendant acknowledged prior convictions . . . the court cannot

say that trial counsel performed deficiently . . . in failing to

challenge the validity of the prior convictions.”).16


                                                            
              15
        Forbes points to Attorney Roy’s comment that “I don’t
feel very good about my role as a defense attorney this morning”
(Sent. Tr. 8) as some sort of indication that counsel performed
deficiently.    To the contrary, the comment reflects defense
counsel’s frustration with the fact that Forbes was unavoidably
subject to the enhanced mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years
as a result of the filing of the § 851 information.
              16
       Forbes’ reliance on Funk v. United States, 552 U.S. 1088,
(2008), is as puzzling as it is misplaced. Upon appeal of this
ruling, the Supreme Court granted certiorari and remanded to the
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of
                                                                           14
 
                              3.            Effect of Dismissal of Conspiracy Charge

              As          a       final               ground                  for           relief,                   Forbes                 claims                 that              his

counsel was ineffective in failing to challenge his conviction

on Count II in view of the dismissal of Count I.                                                                                                                     (Mot. to

Vacate, Ground Five; Pet’r’s Mem. 23-24.)                                                                                         His argument appears

to be that in order to be convicted of the possession-with-

intent-to-distribute offense (Count II), the Government had to

show that he conspired to do so with another person and that it

failed                to         do         so         because                  the           conspiracy                        count               (Count                 I)         was

dismissed.17

              This             claim               is         flawed                 both             factually                       and           legally.                          The

Government                        was           not           required                     to         present                   any           evidence                     on         the

conspiracy count, because that count was dismissed.                                                                                                                 Moreover,

there              is         no         requirement                          that             a       defendant                      be         convicted                       of        a

conspiracy in order to be convicted of possession with intent to

distribute a controlled substance, given that they are separate

offenses.                          See Iannelli v. United States, 420 U.S. 770, 777

(1975) (“Traditionally the law has considered conspiracy and the

decision on remand upholding the original sentence imposed,
United States v. Funk, 534 F.3d 522 (6th Cir. 2008), was itself
vacated pending rehearing en banc, but the appeal was later
dismissed.   560 F.3d 619 (6th Cir. 2009).  Thus, this decision
has no precedential value here.

        Forbes asserts: "The government presented no evidence to
tie Forbes to those with whom Forbes conspired to distribute
cocaine base." (Pet’r’s Mem. 23.)
                                                                                            15

United States v. Lopez, 944 F.2d 33, 41 (1st Cir. 1991).                                                            This

is particularly so where the Government voluntarily dismissed

the          conspiracy                         count           in   view   of   Forbes’     guilty   plea     to    the

substantive count.                                        Accordingly, this claim likewise fails.

III. CONCLUSION

              For the foregoing reasons, Forbes’ claims must be rejected

and his motion to vacate is hereby DENIED and DISMISSED.18

Proceedings                          in         the            United   States    District     Courts,   the     Court

hereby finds that this case is not appropriate for the issuance

of a certificate of appealability because Forbes has failed to

make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional

right as to any claim, as required by 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).



                                                            
              18
        In his conclusion (Pet’r’s Mem. p. X), Forbes makes a
belated attempt to either (a) preserve his right to amend the
instant motion to vacate, or (b) hold the instant matter in
abeyance pending the outcome of his pending proceeding in state
court seeking to overturn his predicate drug conviction.    Each
of the requested actions is based on future speculative
developments of which this Court has no knowledge, and thus both
will be denied.   As noted above, see supra note 11, should he
succeed in overturning his predicate state conviction, Forbes
may seek to modify his sentence in this Court in accordance with
applicable law.    This Court takes no position herein whether
such request for modification would be successful.


                                                                            16
 
     Forbes is advised that any motion to reconsider this ruling

will not extend the time to file a notice of appeal in this

matter.        See   Rule   11(a),    Rule   Governing   Section   2255

Proceedings.



IT IS SO ORDERED.
