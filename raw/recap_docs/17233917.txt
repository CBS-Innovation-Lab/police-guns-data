                        ORDER AFFIRMING THE
             RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE

       The United States Magistrate Judge filed with the Court on December 5, 2007, her

Recommended Decision. The Defendant filed his objections to the Recommended Decision on

December 21, 2007, and the Government filed its response to those objections on January 14,

2008. I have reviewed and considered the Magistrate Judge’s Recommended Decision, together

with the entire record; I have made a de novo determination of all matters adjudicated by the

Magistrate Judge’s Recommended Decision, and I concur with the recommendations of the

United States Magistrate Judge for the reasons set forth in her Recommended Decision, and

determine that no further proceeding is necessary.

       1.      It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the
               Magistrate Judge is hereby AFFIRMED.

       2.      It is further ORDERED that the Defendant’s Motion to Suppress Evidence
               (Docket # 39) is DENIED.

       SO ORDERED.
