                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 07-cr-246-PB

James Lindbloom


                                  O R D E R


     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

May 6, 2008 trial in the above case to allow additional time to

engage in plea negotiations or prepare for trial.            The government

does not object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reason and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from May 6, 2008 to July 8, 2008.             In agreeing

to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. §

3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reason, the ends of

justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the best

interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial

     The April 21, 2008 final pretrial conference is continued to

June 23, 2008 at 4:00 p.m.
