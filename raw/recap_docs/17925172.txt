                                   MIGUEL RODRIGUEZ


                                           ORDER

                                      October 28, 2014



ZOBEL, D.J.

       In light of defendant’s consistent and diligent attempts to pursue his appeal as

reflected in his attorney’s affidavit (Docket # 190-1) and his letter to the court (Docket #

191), the excusable neglect of his attorney, and the absence of any prejudice to the

government, extension of the time to file a notice of appeal is warranted. See U.S. v.

Gaytan-Garza, 652 F.3d 680, 680 (6th Cir. 2011) (“Rule 4(b), unlike Rule 4(a), is not

established by statute, and it is now clear that Rule 4(b) is not jurisdictional.”) (collecting

cases from the Second, Third, Fourth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh and District

of Columbia circuits).

       Defendant‘s Motion to File Notice of Appeal Late is ALLOWED.
