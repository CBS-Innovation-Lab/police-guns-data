                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                       DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

             v.                              Case No. 03-cr-104-01-SM

Fleet Fairbanks

                                    ORDER

      Defendant Fairbanks’ motion to continue the final pretrial conference and

trial is granted (document 9). Trial has been rescheduled for the April 2006

trial period. Defendant Fairbanks shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights not

later than December 22, 2005. On the filing of such waiver, his continuance

shall be effective.

      The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18

U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would

unreasonably deny defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances.

      Final Pretrial Conference: March 23, 2006 at 2:30 p.m.

      Jury Selection: April 4, 2006 at 9:30 a.m.
