                         MEMORANDUM & ORDER

GORTON, J.

     Defendant Dan Smith (“Smith”) has moved this Court to

suppress evidence of a firearm, ammunition and cash discovered

and seized from a car parked near an apartment which had just

been searched pursuant to a warrant.



I.   Background

     In December, 2006, the Taunton Police Department and the

Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (“ATF”)

commenced an investigation of possible drug dealing at an

apartment located on the second floor of 227 Washington Street in

Taunton, Massachusetts (“the Apartment”).       On December 27, 2006,

Taunton Police Officer Troy Medeiros (“Medeiros”) submitted an

application for a search warrant for the Apartment based on

information contained in a supporting affidavit.

     In his affidavit, Medeiros stated that during the week of


                                  -1-
     Case 1:07-cr-10143-NMG Document 30 Filed 02/01/08 Page 2 of 16



December 10, 2006, a cooperating witness (“CW”) told Medeiros

that a man known as “D”, later identified as Smith, was dealing

drugs from the Apartment.    The CW had previously been inside the

Apartment where he had purchased crack cocaine from Smith.            The

CW also stated that “D” drove a red Mazda with registration

number 51ZV89 (“the Mazda”).

     Medeiros also reported in the affidavit that he conducted

surveillance of the Apartment later that week.        He had observed

heavy foot traffic, i.e., persons entering the Apartment via the

fire escape and leaving a few minutes later, which he recognized

to be consistent with drug dealing activity.       Medeiros also

observed the Mazda described by the CW parked in the driveway.

Medeiros directed the CW to call Smith and arrange a controlled

purchase. The CW was searched, given a sum of cash and sent to

the Apartment.   He returned with a substance that tested positive

for crack cocaine which the CW said he purchased from “D”.

     Based on that information, a warrant was issued on December

27, 2006 to search for narcotics and related paraphernalia “at

227 Washington St 2nd Fl” in Taunton, Massachusetts.

     On December 28, 2006, while conducting drive-by surveillance

of the Apartment, Medeiros observed the Mazda parked in the

driveway.   A black man, who fit the description of Smith, got out

of the Mazda and approached a silver vehicle also in the

driveway. Medeiros witnessed an interaction between Smith and the


                                  -2-
         Case 1:07-cr-10143-NMG Document 30 Filed 02/01/08 Page 3 of 16



occupant of the silver car and believed it to be a drug deal.             He

did not see an exchange take place.          After the interaction,

Medeiros saw Smith return to the area of the Mazda.            The silver

car left the area.

     Medeiros then returned to Police Headquarters and assembled

a team to execute the search warrant for the Apartment.             The team

returned to and entered the Apartment, finding a female and three

males, including Smith, inside.         The officers handcuffed the

individuals.      The female told the officers that she owned the

silver car in the driveway.

     The search of the Apartment uncovered crack cocaine, .32

caliber bullets, .22 caliber bullets, a digital scale, a

prescription bearing Smith’s name and a black bag containing

cutting agent, a holster for a handgun and paperwork from Morton

Hospital bearing Smith’s name.1

     Nearby Smith the officers recovered a set of car keys.

Taunton Police Detective Christopher Williams (“Williams”)

questioned Smith about the keys.         Smith told Williams that the

keys were for the Mazda parked in the driveway, which was

registered to his sister.        Williams told Smith that he was going

to search the car.       At the evidentiary hearing on this motion,

Williams testified that he believed he had the authority to


     1
     The government lists the .32 caliber bullets as being in
the black bag but the inventory from the search warrant lists
them independent of the black bag.

                                      -3-
      Case 1:07-cr-10143-NMG Document 30 Filed 02/01/08 Page 4 of 16



search the car with or without Smith’s consent and that when he

told Smith he was going to search his car he was not looking for

Smith’s consent but rather for resistance to confirm Williams’s

suspicions.     Upon Williams’s announcement that he would search

the Mazda, Smith shrugged and said “go ahead”.         Williams

proceeded to search the vehicle.

      In the trunk of the Mazda, Williams found a .40 caliber

magazine inside a book bag, a .44 caliber pistol, .44 caliber

ammunition and .38 caliber ammunition.       Williams then searched

the vehicle’s interior and discovered medication bottles bearing

Dan Smith’s name, $2,380 inside a wallet also containing

identification for Dan Smith, a probation slip bearing Dan

Smith’s name and an additional $1,351.       Smith was then

transported to the Taunton Police station for booking.



II.   Motion to Suppress (Docket No. 23)

      Smith moves the Court to suppress the evidence of the

firearm, ammunition and cash found in the Mazda because 1) the

police did not have a warrant to search the car, 2) Smith did not

consent to the search, 3) the automobile exception does not apply

and 4) the police did not have probable cause to search the car.

      A.   The Warrant and Curtilage

           1.     Legal Standard for Warrants

      The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches


                                   -4-
     Case 1:07-cr-10143-NMG Document 30 Filed 02/01/08 Page 5 of 16



and seizures by requiring, in most cases, a valid warrant.

Bilida v. McCleod, 211 F.3d 166, 171 (1st Cir. 2000).         A

warrantless search or seizure is presumptively unreasonable and

will be upheld only if an exception to the warrant requirement

applies.   Id.   The authority granted by a warrant for the search

of a premises is limited by the description in the warrant and

does not extend to additional areas.      United States v. Bonner,

808 F.2d 864, 868 (1st Cir. 1986).       When a warrant is issued for

a “premises”, however, the First Circuit has interpreted that

term broadly.    See United States v. Asselin, 775 F.2d 445 (1st

Cir. 1985) (holding that the search of a disabled automobile

adjacent to carport was permissible during search of “premises”

pursuant to warrant).

           2.    Application

     The search warrant issued in this case authorized a search

for narcotics “at 227 Washington St 2nd Fl Taunton MA”.           In its

brief, the government asserts that Smith’s car was within the

curtilage of the Apartment and that it was therefore within the

scope of the warrant.    Its argument, however, unnecessarily

complicates the analysis.      The key inquiry is whether the warrant

permitted the search of any property or premises outside of the

apartment, not whether the car was within the curtilage.

     The government cites numerous cases for the proposition that

a vehicle parked in a driveway is within the scope of a search


                                   -5-
     Case 1:07-cr-10143-NMG Document 30 Filed 02/01/08 Page 6 of 16



warrant for the residence, but all of those cases involve

warrants issued for a “premises” or “property”, not a specific

unit within an apartment building.      The warrant for Smith’s

Apartment was limited to the second floor of the two-family house

in question and did not permit a search of the “premises” or

“property” at a certain address.     Cf. United States v. Asselin,

775 F.2d 445 (1st Cir. 1985).     The government notes that the

search warrant includes the word “property” in its introduction,

to wit: “I find that there is PROBABLE CAUSE to believe that the

property described below” etc.     The word “property” in that

context, however, refers to the object of the warrant and not to

the “premises” or “property” being searched.

     The government cites no authority and this Court has found

none to indicate that all search warrants for a particular

residence include within their scope authorization to search the

entire premises.   In fact, warrants often specify that curtilage

and/or motor vehicles may be searched, indicating that such areas

or items are not automatically included within the scope of a

warrant for a residence.    See, e.g., Quiles v. Kilson, 337 F.

Supp. 2d 224, 227 (D. Mass. 2004)(involving a warrant authorizing

search of the Apartment, including the “curtilage”).         Because the

warrant in this case was limited to the Apartment itself, it did

not include property outside the Apartment and thus the warrant

did not authorize the search of the nearby Mazda.

     B.    Consent

           1.     Legal Standard for Consent

     A search conducted pursuant to valid consent is

constitutionally permissible even in absence of a warrant or

probable cause.    Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 222

(1973).   When a prosecutor relies on consent to support the

validity of a search, it is his burden to prove that consent was

freely and voluntarily given.     Id.   The determination is made

after considering the totality of circumstances.        Id. at 227.    A

simple response of “okay” to an officer’s claim of authority to

search is not voluntary consent.     United States v. Weidul, 325

F.3d 50, 53-54 (1st Cir. 2003).

           2.     Application

     Memoranda of the parties do not elucidate the circumstances

surrounding Smith’s alleged consent to the search.        At the

evidentiary hearing, however, Williams testified that he told

Smith he was going to search the Mazda not for the purpose of

gaining consent but as a police tactic.      In response to that

statement, Smith shrugged and said “go ahead”.        Looking at the

totality of the circumstances, Williams’s statement, rather than

a question, demonstrates that Williams did not seek (nor did

Smith provide) consent to search the Mazda.

     The government contends that, even if Williams did not seek

consent, Smith gave it by virtue of his shrug and the comment “go


                                  -7-
        Case 1:07-cr-10143-NMG Document 30 Filed 02/01/08 Page 8 of 16



ahead”.     The government is incorrect.      The First Circuit has made

clear that acquiescence in response to a show of authority is not

the equivalent to consent.       United States v. Weidul, 325 F.3d 50,

53-54 (1st Cir. 2003).       In Weidul, a police officer stated to a

resident, “I am going to look in here,” referring to a room in

the house.     Id. at 53.    The resident replied, “Okay,” and the

officer entered the room and found a gun.          Id.   The court held

that the resident did not voluntarily consent to the search

because a reasonable person in her shoes would have understood

the officer to be asserting lawful authority to conduct the

search.     Id. at 54.   Her response was merely acquiescence.           Id.

The present case is analogous.        When Williams stated his intent

to search the Mazda, Smith acquiesced to authority.           He did not

consent to the search.

     C.      The Motor Vehicle Exception

             1.   Legal Standard for the Motor Vehicle Exception

     The motor vehicle exception permits the warrantless search

of a motor vehicle when supported by probable cause.            Coolidge v.

New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 460 (1971).          The justification to

conduct a warrantless search of a vehicle does not depend on the

reviewing court’s assessment that the car would have been driven

away.     See Michigan v. Thomas, 458 U.S. 259, 261 (1982).         Nor

does any particular exigency need to exist.          United States v.

Panitz, 907 F.2d 1267, 1271-72 (1st Cir. 1990).

          2.   The Motor Vehicle Exception and Private Property

     Smith argues that the motor vehicle exception does not apply

to cars parked on private property.       The government responds by

citing a string of cases that hold that a motor vehicle may be

searched upon a finding of probable cause.       All of the cited

cases (with one exception noted below) involve vehicles stopped

on the roadway or parked in other public places.        See, e.g.,

United States v. McCoy, 977 F.2d 706, 710 (1st Cir. 1992)(holding

the search of a van permissible in a bank parking lot); United

States v. Panitz, 907 F.2d 1267, 1271 (1st Cir. 1990)(holding

that a warrantless search is permissible if a vehicle is stopped

on roadway or parked in a public place); United States v.

Fiasconaro, 315 F.3d 28, 37 (1st Cir. 2002)(upholding a search in

the context of a traffic stop); United States v. Lopez, 380 F.3d

538 (1st Cir. 2004) (assuming without discussing that the motor

vehicle exception applies when the searched car is parked in a

condominium complex parking lot).       Although many of the cited

cases use expansive language to suggest that probable cause is

the only requirement when an officer searches a vehicle, they

also contain restrictive language limiting warrantless searches

of vehicles to those found on roadways or in other public places.

See, e.g., Panitz, 907 F.2d at 1272 (“the existence of probable

cause justifies a warrantless seizure and reasonable search of a

motor vehicle lawfully stopped in transit or parked in a public


                                  -9-
     Case 1:07-cr-10143-NMG Document 30 Filed 02/01/08 Page 10 of 16



place...”); McCoy, 977 F.2d at 710 (“probable cause alone

justifies a warrantless search of a motor vehicle seized without

a warrant while parked in a public place”).

     The Supreme Court has also suggested that the motor vehicle

exception does not apply to cars parked in residential locations.

E.g., Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443 (1971) (declining

to uphold a search where a vehicle is unoccupied, parked on

private property and beyond the scope of a valid search incident

to an arrest).   The rationale and scope of the automobile

exception has changed since the Coolidge decision was rendered,

however.   See, e.g., Maryland v. Dyson, 527 U.S. 465 (1999)(per

curiam)(holding that the automobile exception has no separate

exigency requirement); California v. Carney, 471 U.S. 386, 392-93

(1985)(holding that there are two justifications for the

automobile exception: the inherent mobility of automobiles and

the lesser expectation of privacy because of “the pervasive

regulation of vehicles capable of traveling on the public

highways”).   Moreover, in a per curiam decision, the Supreme

Court held that a warrantless search of an automobile in the

driveway of a farmhouse did not violate the Fourth Amendment

although it is unclear whether the defendant had any connection

to the farmhouse.   Pennsylvania v. Labron, 518 U.S. 938 (1996).

     At least five Circuit Courts have held that the motor

vehicle exception applies even when a car is parked on a private


                                  -10-
     Case 1:07-cr-10143-NMG Document 30 Filed 02/01/08 Page 11 of 16



driveway.   See, e.g., United States v. Hines, 449 F.3d 808 (7th

Cir. 2006); United States v. Brookins, 345 F.3d 231 (4th Cir.

2003); United States v. Flatden, 230 F.3d 1083 (8th Cir. 2000);

United States v. Markham, 844 F.2d 366, 368 (6th Cir. 1988);

United States v. Hamilton, 792 F.2d 837, 843 (9th Cir. 1986).2

The Fourth Circuit has suggested, however, that “heightened

privacy interests may be triggered when a vehicle is encountered

on private property”, Brookins, 345 F.3d at 237 n.8, and the

Fifth Circuit has stated that the motor vehicle exception “may

not apply when a vehicle is parked at the residence of the

criminal defendant challenging the constitutionality of the

search” United States v. Fields, 456 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.

2006).

     The First Circuit Court of Appeals has had at least one

occasion to decide whether to apply the motor vehicle exception

to an automobile parked in a private driveway.        In United States

v. Moscatiello, 771 F.2d 589 (1st Cir. 1985), the First Circuit

upheld the search of an automobile parked in a private driveway,

stating that, although it was parked on private property, it was

not parked on the defendant’s property and furthermore that the


     2
     The government cites an additional case from the Fourth
Circuit, but that case, decided before the Supreme Court made
clear that the motor vehicle exception did not require a showing
of exigency, specifically states that the search was permissible
because the defendant was about to drive off with the suspected
contraband. United States v. Shepherd, 714 F.2d 316, 319-20 (4th
Cir. 1983).

                                  -11-
     Case 1:07-cr-10143-NMG Document 30 Filed 02/01/08 Page 12 of 16



police had pursued the automobile into the driveway (rather than

it having been parked there indefinitely).       Id. at 599-600,

vacated on other grounds by Murray v. United States, 487 U.S. 533

(1988).   In this case, it is unclear whether 227 Washington

Street served as Smith’s residence although he declared in an

affidavit that it was not.      This Court need not decide the scope

of the motor vehicle exception or whether the Mazda was parked at

Smith’s residence because, notwithstanding those contingencies,

there was no probable cause to search the vehicle.

     D.    Probable Cause

           1.     Legal Standard

     Probable cause to search a vehicle requires that at the time

of the search, the officer had “reasonably trustworthy

information of supporting facts and circumstances” to justify the

search.   United States v. Infante-Ruiz, 13 F.3d 498, 502 (1st

Cir. 1994).     Probable cause exists when there is a fair

probability that contraband or evidence will be found in the

place described.     United States v. Moore, 790 F.2d 13, 15 (1st

Cir. 1986).     A probable cause determination should be based on

the totality of the circumstances.        Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S.

213 (1983).

           2.     Application

     The government asserts the following sources of support for

a finding of probable cause:


                                   -12-
     Case 1:07-cr-10143-NMG Document 30 Filed 02/01/08 Page 13 of 16



                a.   Pre-raid Observations

     Prior to obtaining a search warrant and in preparation for

executing it, Medeiros conducted surveillance on the Apartment

and observed heavy foot traffic in and out, which indicated the

likelihood of drug activity.     The activity Medeiros observed took

place inside the apartment and did not involve the Mazda.

Although the CW told Medeiros that Smith drove a red Mazda, he

did not indicate that Smith used the Mazda to deliver drugs,

reporting instead that Smith sold drugs out of the Apartment.          On

the day the police executed the search warrant, Medeiros also saw

a man later identified as Smith get out of the Mazda and approach

a silver car in his driveway.     Medeiros stated that he believed

that he was witnessing a drug deal but Medeiros did not see an

exchange, Smith did not re-enter the Mazda and the owner of the

silver car turned out to be the female later arrested in the

Apartment.   Because the pre-raid observations did not connect

contraband or evidence of a crime to the Mazda, they are

insufficient to establish probable cause to search the Mazda.

See United States v. Garcon, 2008 WL 60405, at *12 (S.D. Fla.

Jan. 3, 2008)(holding that the police lacked probable cause and

noting that the police had not observed the defendant

transporting, storing or conducting any drug business or other

illegal activity from his vehicle); United States v. Gunning, 405

F. Supp. 2d 79, 83 (D. Mass. 2005)(allowing a motion to suppress


                                  -13-
        Case 1:07-cr-10143-NMG Document 30 Filed 02/01/08 Page 14 of 16



because, although police had probable cause relating to general

criminal activity, that was not sufficient to justify a

warrantless search or seizure of an automobile). Cf. United

States v. Brown, 923 F.2d 109, 110 (8th Cir. 1991)(anonymous tip

that defendant was dealing drugs out of a car, confirmed by

police observation of hand movements and brief exchange in

vehicle established probable cause for a warrantless search of

the vehicle).

                   b.    Evidence of Drugs and Firearms Seized From
                         the Apartment

     In the search of the Apartment, the police uncovered crack

cocaine, a digital scale and ammunition as well as a black bag

containing cutting agent, a holster and paperwork bearing Smith’s

name.    The government asserts that those discoveries made it

probable that additional contraband, such as a gun, would be

found in the Mazda.       The finding of contraband in one location

occupied by a defendant does not, however, establish probable

cause that contraband will be found in every location frequented

by the defendant.       See United States v. Hogan, 25 F.3d 690, 694

(8th Cir. 1994)(holding that information that defendant drove a

truck to work where he distributed drugs and discovery of small

amount of marijuana, two scales, weapons, a police scanner and

$5,600 in cash during search of home did not establish probable

cause to search second automobile owned by defendant).            Even

though the police found a bag with a holster and paperwork

                                     -14-
     Case 1:07-cr-10143-NMG Document 30 Filed 02/01/08 Page 15 of 16



bearing Smith’s name, they had no particular facts to link, by a

fair probability, his vehicle to additional contraband.          See

United States v. Holly, 219 F. Supp. 2d 117, 125-26 (D.D.C. 2002)

(holding that police lacked probable cause to search a vehicle

after a cursory search of the defendant’s apartment revealed

ammunition but no firearm).     Cf. United States v. Dickerson, 2008

WL 192295 (1st Cir. Jan. 24, 2008)(holding that police had

probable cause to search car where they found drugs in

defendant’s house, defendant was evasive about owning the

searched car, an informant had told police that defendant carried

a handgun in a hidden console in his car and police officer

observed alterations in undercarriage of car indicating a hidden

console); United States v. Spenser, 1 F.3d 742, 746 (9th Cir.

1993)(holding that police had probable cause to believe that a

vehicle contained a firearm because the defendant was wearing a

holster and made suspicious movements while sitting in the

vehicle); United States v. Wider 951 F.2d 1283, 1286 (D.C. Cir.

1991)(finding probable cause where the defendant was on foot,

drugs packaged for sale were found on his person and his car was

parked nearby).    Consequently, finding contraband in the

apartment did not establish probable cause to search the Mazda.

                  c.   The Knowledge and Experience of the Officers

     The government also asserts that the searching officers

dealers typically make deliveries of narcotics in vehicles and

that it was therefore probable that Smith’s Mazda contained

contraband.   Probable cause must be based, however, on supporting

facts and circumstances.     Infante-Ruiz, 13 F.3d at 502.        Probable

cause may not be based on “conventional wisdom” or reputation.

Id.   Without specific information linking the Mazda to contraband

or evidence of a crime, the police did not have probable cause to

search the Mazda.

      Because the search warrant did not include the Mazda within

its scope, Smith did not give his consent to search the car and

there was no probable cause to search the car, the defendant’s

motion to suppress will be allowed.



                                  ORDER

      In accordance with the foregoing, the defendant’s Motion to

Suppress Evidence (Docket No. 23) is ALLOWED.



So ordered.
