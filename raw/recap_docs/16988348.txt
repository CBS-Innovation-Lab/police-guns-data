                  RECOMMENDED DECISION ON MOTION TO DISMISS


       The defendant moves for dismissal of this action due to a violation of the Speedy Trial Act, 18

U.S.C. § 3161 et seq. Motion and Incorporated Memorandum to Dismiss for Violation of the Speedy

Trial Act (“Motion”) (Docket No. 31) at 1. The government agrees that a violation of the Act has

occurred. Government’s Response to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss, etc. (“Opposition”) (Docket

No. 37) at 1. The only question for the court, therefore, is whether the dismissal should be with

prejudice — the defendant’s position — or without — the alternative advocated by the government.

See Docket No. 39. An evidentiary hearing was held before me on February 8, 2006. I recommend

that the motion be granted without prejudice.

                                       I. Applicable Statutes

       The relevant portions of the Speedy Trial Act provide as follows:

               (b) Any information or indictment charging an individual with the
            commission of an offense shall be filed within thirty days form the date on
            which such individual was arrested or served with a summons in connection
            with such charges.

               (c)(1) In any case in which a plea of not guilty is entered, the trial of a
            defendant charged in an information or indictment with the commission of an
            offense shall commence within seventy days from the filing date (and making
            public) of the information or indictment or from the date the defendant has

            appeared before a judicial officer of the court in which such charge is
            pending, whichever date last occurs.

18 U.S.C. § 3161(b) & (c)(1).

               (a)(1) If, in the case of any individual against whom a complaint if filed
            charging such individual with an offense, no indictment or information if filed
            within the time limit required by section 3161(b) . . . , such charge against
            that individual contained in such complaint shall be dismissed or otherwise
            dropped. In determining whether to dismiss the case with or without
            prejudice, the court shall consider, among others, each of the following
            factors: the seriousness of the offense; the facts and circumstances of the case
            which led to the dismissal; and the impact of a reprosecution on the
            administration of this chapter and on the administration of justice.

               (2) If a defendant is not brought to trial within the time limit required by
            section 3161(c) . . . , the information or indictment shall be dismissed on
            motion of the defendant.

18 U.S.C. § 3162(a).

               (a) The trial or other disposition of cases involving —
                       (1) a detained person who is being held in detention solely
            because he is awaiting trial . . .
            shall be accorded priority.

               (b) The trial of any person described in subsection (a)(1) . . . of this
            section shall commence not later than ninety days following the beginning of
            such continuous detention . . . .

18 U.S.C. § 3164.

                                    II. Procedural Background

       A complaint and synopsis were filed on April 8, 2005. Docket Nos. 1 & 2. The defendant

was arrested on April 25, 2005. Docket. On April 26, 2005 the government filed a motion for

detention, Docket No. 4; an initial appearance at which Michael Whipple, Esq. was appointed to

represent the defendant was held, Docket No. 6; and an order of temporary detention was entered,

Docket No. 7. The detention hearing was scheduled for April 29, 2005 and continued for three weeks

on the defendant’s motion. Docket Nos. 6 & 12-13. The hearing was reset for May 24, 2005, Docket

No. 14, and continued to July 5, 2005 on the defendant’s motion, Docket Nos. 18-20.

          On July 5, 2005 the defendant waived preliminary examination and the detention hearing and I

entered an order of detention. Docket No. 23. The next docket entry reflects the filing of an indictment

of the defendant on October 26, 2005. Docket No. 26. Arraignment was held on November 1, 2005.

Docket No. 29. The motion to dismiss now before the court was filed on November 16, 2005. Docket

No. 31.

                                     III. Proposed Findings of Fact

          Darcie McElwee, the assistant United States Attorney who handled this case from its inception

until shortly before the hearing on the motion to dismiss, submitted an affidavit (Defendant’s Exh. 1) in

response to my order of January 3, 2006, Docket No. 39, in which she sets out the following facts

relevant to the motion to dismiss. Affidavit of Darcie N. McElwee (“AUSA Aff.”) (Docket No. 41).

Ms. McElwee filed on April 8, 2005 the criminal complaint charging the defendant with violations of

18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1) and 922(j). Id. ¶ 1. After the defendant’s initial appearance in this court on

April 26, 2005, Ms. McElwee informed Mr. Whipple that she would wait to hear from him as to

whether his client wanted to plead guilty or to proceed by indictment before she would present the

case to the grand jury. Id. ¶ 2. In his second motion to continue, the defendant waived his rights under

the Speedy Trial Act from May 20, 2005 to July 15, 2005, Defendant’s Second Unopposed Request to

Continue Mr. Dimott’s Preliminary Hearing (Docket No. 19) ¶ 6, although the parties agree that he

intended to do so only through July 5, 2005, AUSA Aff. ¶ 3; Motion at 3.

          The remaining facts are taken from the testimony and exhibits admitted at the hearing.

          As a result of the same incident that gave rise to the current federal charges, the defendant was

charged with burglary in state court, but that charge has been dismissed. Ms. McElwee did not ask




                                                     3
Case 2:05-cr-00089-GZS Document 59 Filed 02/13/06 Page 4 of 11                         PageID #: 123



Mr. Whipple to include the waiver of the defendant’s rights under the Speedy Trial Act in his second

motion to continue. She did not discuss the Speedy Trial Act with Mr. Whipple at any time before he

filed that motion. She had no contact with Mr. Whipple between May 20, when he called to ask her

position on the second motion to continue, and July 5, when she and Mr. Whipple met with me in

chambers. The defendant came into court that day to waive preliminary examination and a detention

hearing. She and Mr. Whipple met later that day in her office, at Mr. Whipple’s request, with Jonathan

Chapman, who is chief of the criminal division of the United States Attorney’s office. Mr. Whipple

was late for the meeting, as he advised Ms. McElwee and Mr. Chapman he would be because of state

court matters, and Ms. McElwee had to leave before the meeting was completed.

       At the meeting, Mr. Whipple made a request to Mr. Chapman that he had previously

unsuccessfully made to Ms. McElwee, namely that the defendant not be charged under the Armed

Career Criminal Act, the application of which would significantly increase the possible sentence to

which the defendant was exposed. Mr. Chapman explained to Mr. Whipple that the United States

Attorney had no power to do what he asked. There was no discussion of the Speedy Trial Act during

this meeting. At the end of the meeting, Mr. Chapman understood that Mr. Whipple would get back to

Ms. McElwee about a possible plea to an information by the defendant. Mr. Whipple did not say at

that time whether his client had decided to cooperate or not to cooperate. Mr. Whipple, on the other

hand, left the meeting with the understanding that he and the United States Attorney “were done

talking,” and that plea negotiations were over. He did not ask for any delay in indicting the defendant

during the meeting or at any other time. He made no further effort to contact Ms. McElwee or anyone

else in the United States Attorney’s office about this case.

       Ms. McElwee testified that she next spoke with Mr. Whipple on September 19, 2005, when he

returned a call that she had made to him at his office to inform him that the defendant had attempted to




                                                   4
Case 2:05-cr-00089-GZS Document 59 Filed 02/13/06 Page 5 of 11                                            PageID #: 124



escape. She testified that Mr. Whipple did not ask during this conversation that she refrain from

indicting the defendant. Mr. Whipple testified that he was at home on September 19, 2005 following

the birth of his third child on September 15, 2005; that he has no record and no memory of a

conversation with Ms. McElwee on September 19; and that he would have made an entry in his billing

log if he had had such a conversation, but there is no such entry. He also testified that he made all of

his business calls from his home on his cell phone. Defendant’s Exhibit 2 consists of portions of Mr.

Whipple’s cell phone records for the relevant period of time which show no calls to the office of the

United States Attorney. Zoe Wall, who works in Mr. Whipple’s office, testified that he was not in the

office on September 19, 2005; that she received a call from a woman at a prosecutor’s office who

indicated that the defendant had tried to escape while in state court by using a paper clip to undo his

handcuffs; that this woman did not ask her to call Mr. Whipple to tell him this or to ask him to call her;

and that she tried to reach Mr. Whipple on his cell phone but was unsuccessful. Defendant’s Exhibit 2

does show three calls between Mr. Whipple’s cell phone and his office on September 19, 2005. Ms.

Wall testified that no one from Mr. Whipple’s office ever calls him at home on his land-line telephone;

she doubted that anyone at the office even knew the number for this telephone.

         On October 21, 2005, after being contacted by e-mail from the office of the clerk of this court

with a query about the status of this and three other cases, Ms. McElwee wrote a prosecution

approved memorandum about this case, which is required by the United States Attorney before seeking

an indictment. On that day she also contacted Mr. Whipple and told him when he returned her call that

an e-mail from the clerk’s office had noted that the Speedy Trial Act clock was running, that she had to

decide what to do and she needed to know whether the defendant was going to cooperate. Mr.

Whipple responded merely that Ms. McElwee should do what she had to do.1 He did not tell her that

plea negotiations were still ongoing or ask her to take any particular action. They did discuss when

the grand jury would next be meeting.

          Mr. Chapman testified that if Mr. Whipple had told him during the July 5 meeting that his client

was not interested in cooperating or that negotiations were over, or words to that effect, Mr. Chapman

would have told Ms. McElwee that the case was ready for indictment, which he did not do. He

testified that it is not uncommon for things to take “several months” when a defendant’s attorney is

interested in proceeding by way of an information rather than an indictment, but also that it is not

common for the defense attorney and the assistant United States Attorney not to have any contact during

that period.

          Ms. McElwee testified adamantly that she did not delay presenting this case to the grand jury

for indictment in order to obtain a tactical or procedural advantage. Mr. Whipple was equally strong

in his testimony that after July 5, 2005 he never did or said anything to suggest that the government

should delay this prosecution in any way.

          The government concedes that the time accrued under the Speedy Trial Act in this case “was

112 days, well in excess of the 30 days allowed by statute.” Government’s Response to Defendant’s

Motion to Dismiss, etc. (Docket No. 37) at 2-3.




                                                        IV. Discussion

          The First Circuit teaches that

                [t]he apparent purpose of the thirty-day arrest-to-indictment rule is to ensure
                that the defendant is not held under an arrest warrant for an excessive period

be necessary and he told her that it would not be. Ms. McElwee testified on rebuttal that she could only draft a “cooperation” or plea
agreement after learning that a defendant would cooperate, and she was never told that in this case, so she would not have presented
Mr. Whipple with such an agreement nor asked whether it needed to be updated.



                                                                  6

            without receiving formal notice of the charge against which he must prepare
            to defend himself.

United States v. Meade, 110 F.3d 190, 200 (1st Cir. 1997) (citation and internal quotation marks

omitted). Further,

            [i]n enacting the Speedy Trial Act, Congress acknowledged that a person
            subject to prolonged pretrial delays faces a number of debilitating factors,
            including the disruption of family life, loss of employment, anxiety,
            suspicion, and public obloquy.

Id. at 201 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).

       In deciding the question posed in this case, the court has discretion to decide whether the

dismissal of the charges will be with or without prejudice. United States v. Hastings, 847 F.2d 920,

924 (1st Cir. 1988). “In considering the question, [the court] must start from a level playing field;

there is no presumption either way.” Id. (citation omitted). In addition to the factors listed in 18

U.S.C. § 3162(a)(2), the court may consider the length of the delay and the prejudice to the defendant

stemming from the violation, or the absence of prejudice. Id.

                                  A. Seriousness of the Offense

       The defendant is charged with being a felon in possession of 17 firearms, in violation of 18

U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), and with possession of 17 stolen firearms, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(j).

Criminal Complaint (Docket No. 1) at [1]-[3]. Due to his prior felony convictions, the defendant is

exposed to a statutory minimum sentence of 15 years if he is convicted. See Opposition at 3-4. The

First Circuit has held that charges of seven counts of possession of cocaine and methamphetamine with

intent to distribute and one count of possession of a firearm during commission of a felony are

“extremely serious.” Hastings, 847 F.2d at 925. It noted that “[t]he graver the crimes, the greater the

insult to societal interests if the charges are dropped, once and for all, without a meaningful

determination of guilt or innocence.” Id. These charges, the First Circuit said, without mentioning the




                                                  7
Case 2:05-cr-00089-GZS Document 59 Filed 02/13/06 Page 8 of 11                                                    PageID #: 127



potential sentence, “point[] directly toward dismissal without prejudice.” Id. Similarly, in United

States v. Barnes, 159 F.3d 4, 16 (1st Cir. 1998), the First Circuit held that a charge of conspiracy to

import 110 kilograms of cocaine into the Untied States was “the type of drugs-for-profit scheme that

Congress has deemed a serious felony,” and thus “militates heavily in favor of permitting

reprosecution.” Judge Carter of this court, in United States v. Saravia, 851 F.Supp. 490, 493 (D. Me.

1994), held that the charges of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and possession with intent to distribute

250 grams of cocaine were “very serious,” supporting a dismissal without prejudice.2

          The defendant contends, without citation to authority, that the seriousness of the offenses with

which he is charged is mitigated for purposes of section 3162 by the fact that he may still be tried in

state court on the burglary charge that arose from the same conduct. No evidence in support of this

assertion was presented. Nor has my research located any case law supporting this proposition. I

doubt that Congress intended the federal courts to consider the availability of state-law charges when

evaluating the seriousness of the federal charges at issue under section 3162.3 In the absence of any

authority holding otherwise, I decline to consider this argument.

          I have similarly failed to located reported case law holding that the charges of being a felon in

possession of a firearm and possession of a stolen firearm are sufficiently serious to weigh in favor of

dismissal of charges without prejudice under the Speedy Trial Act. However, courts have found such

charges to be sufficiently serious to mandate dismissal without prejudice under the similar speedy trial

2
  Counsel for the defendant relies heavily on Judge Carter’s admonition in Saravia that “[t]he Court will not be inclined to treat future
sub rosa violations of the Act with such leniency.” 851 F. Supp. at 493; Defendant’s Response to Order Reserving Ruling on
Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss, etc. (Docket No. 43) at 2. The violation that occurred in this case is quite different from the violation
at issue in Saravia, where the prosecutor effectively decided unilaterally that the mandates of the Speedy Trial Act could be set aside.
851 F. Supp. at 491-93.

  Under Maine law, burglary is usually a Class C crime. 17-A M.R.S.A. § 401(1). A Class C crime carries a penalty of imprisonment
for up to five years. 17-A M.R.S.A. § 1252(2)(C). It is possible that burglary may be charged as a Class B crime, with a potential
term of imprisonment up to ten years, 17-A M.R.S.A. § 1252(2)(B), or a Class A crime, with a potential term of imprisonment up to
twenty years, 17-A M.R.S.A. § 1252(2)(A), but the defendant made no attempt to show that any of the aggravating factors were
present in this case. As counsel for both the government and the defendant emphasized at the hearing, the defendant faces a

standard of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act, United States v. McKinney, 395 F.3d 837, 840-

41 (8th Cir. 2005); United States v. Martinez, 376 F.Supp.2d 1168, 1175-76 (D.N.M. 2004). I

accordingly conclude that the first statutory factor weighs in favor of dismissal without prejudice.

                                   B. Circumstances Leading to the Delay

         As I informed the parties at the close of the hearing, there is no evidence to support a

conclusion that the government’s delay in this case was intentional and I impute no improper motive to

its clear negligence. “Even though a prosecutor does not bear the burden of monitoring the court’s

compliance with the Speedy Trial Act in absence of an announced rule, district courts do look to

prosecutors for assistance as officers of the court.” Barnes, 159 F.3d at 16-17 (citation and internal

punctuation omitted). “Where, as here, the actual speedy trial violation resulted solely from neglect

rather than intentional misconduct, that circumstance tips ever so slightly in favor of dismissal without

prejudice.” Barnes, 159 F.3d at 17; Hastings, 847 F.2d at 925. There is no evidence of a “pattern of

governmental inattention” in the existence of two cases in which the Speedy Trial Act has been

violated, so the situation cannot “become[] more conducive to dismissal with prejudice,” Hastings,

847 F.2d at 925, for that reason. See also Saravia, 851 F. Supp. at 493. “[U]nintentional neglect . . .

weights in favor of dismissal without prejudice.” United States v. Medugno, 233 F.Supp.2d 184, 186

(D. Mass. 2002). I conclude that, in the circumstances here, this factor weighs slightly in favor of

dismissal without prejudice.

                                            C. Effect of Reprosecution

         As the First Circuit said in Barnes,

               [t]here is little doubt that the harsh remedy of dismissal with prejudice has
               greater deterrence value than its counterpart. But considerations of general
               deterrence are not dispositive or else dismissal with prejudice would
               impermissibly become the preferred tool.

159 F.3d at 17-18. In making this observation, the First Circuit relied on the words of the Supreme

Court in United States v. Taylor, 487 U.S.326, 342 (1988) (“Dismissal without prejudice is not a

toothless sanction: it forces the Government to obtain a new indictment if it decides to reprosecute,

and it exposes the prosecution to dismissal on statute of limitations grounds.”).

          When there is a causal connection between the government’s behavior and the speedy trial

infraction, that link works in favor of dismissal with prejudice. Hastings, 847 F.2d at 926-27. The

weight is overborne, however, in the absence of special prejudice to the defendant. Id. at 926.

”[T]heoretical prejudice alone is . . . too fragile a reed to support ‘with prejudice’ dismissal — at

least where the charges are grave and the delay fribbling.” Id. at 928. I find a delay of 82 days

beyond the statutory deadline to be anything but “fribbling,”4 and I believe that the administration of

the Speedy Trial Act would be best served by dismissal with prejudice in this case. See also Saravia,

851 F. Supp. at 493. However, I also find that the defendant has not shown actual prejudice in this

case. In response to my question about prejudice, defense counsel speculated at the close of the

hearing that the memories of witnesses who will be called to testify at the hearing on the motion to

suppress that was previously filed in this case and will presumably be filed again should the charges

be reinstituted will be more vague due to the passage of time. That simply does not constitute actual

prejudice. Counsel also cited the fact that the defendant has been incarcerated for nine months, “a

sentence imposed with no process whatsoever.” The length of that incarceration bothers me as well.

However, even if I were to find that the final statutory factor weighs in favor of dismissal with

prejudice, I could only conclude, given the First Circuit’s construction of the Speedy Trial Act, that
