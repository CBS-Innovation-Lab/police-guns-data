                RECOMMENDED DECISION ON MOTION TO SUPPRESS

       Richard W. Szpyt, indicted on charges, inter alia, of conspiring to distribute, and possess

with intent to distribute, controlled substances, including five kilograms or more of cocaine, and

marijuana, and aiding and abetting such conduct, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 846 and 841(a)(1)

and 18 U.S.C. § 2, see Superseding Indictment (Docket No. 456), moves to suppress evidence

seized from 94 Ross Road, Old Orchard Beach, Maine, on September 23, 2007, pursuant to a

search warrant that he contends failed to establish probable cause for the search, see Motion To

Suppress Evidence Seized From 94 Ross Road (“Motion”) (Docket No. 358) at 1.

       The sole basis for the Motion is that the affidavit supporting the government’s application

for the warrant relied in part on information garnered from allegedly illegal wire intercepts. See

id. at 1, 3. Szpyt argues that once the assertedly tainted information is expunged, the remaining

averments of the affidavit fail to establish probable cause for the Ross Road search. See id. To

establish the illegality of the relevant wire intercepts, he relies on a motion to suppress filed by

his co-defendant James Weston, in which he joined. See id. at 1 n.1, 4; see also Motion To

Suppress Wire Intercepts (Docket No. 346); Defendant Szpyt’s Motion To Join[] Co-Defendant

Weston’s Motion To Suppress Wire Intercepts (Docket No. 360); Order [granting Szpyt’s

motion for joinder] (Docket No. 373).       As the government points out, see Government’s

Opposition to Defendant Szpyt’s Motion To Suppress Evidence (Docket No. 586) at 1 & n.1,

Weston’s bid to suppress the wire intercepts was denied, see Recommended Decision on

Motions To Suppress (Docket No. 514); Order Affirming the Recommended Decision of the

Magistrate Judge (Docket No. 573).         Since the instant motion explicitly stands on the

unsuccessful arguments in Weston’s motion to suppress, it must share the same fate.

Accordingly, I recommend that it be DENIED.
