Plaintiff
vs                                           CRIMINAL 13-0884CCC
JUAN G. OTERO-AVILES
Defendant


                                     ORDER

     Having considered the Report and Recommendation filed on July 22,
2014 (docket entry 33) on a Rule 11 proceeding of defendant Juan G.
Otero-Avilés before U.S. Magistrate-Judge Bruce J. McGiverin on July 21,
2014, to which no objection has been filed, the same is APPROVED.
Accordingly, the plea of guilty of defendant is accepted. The Court FINDS that
his plea was voluntary and intelligently entered with awareness of his rights
and the consequences of pleading guilty and contains all elements of the
offense charged in the indictment.
     This case was referred to the U.S. Probation Office for preparation of a
Presentence Investigation Report since July 21, 2014.       The sentencing
hearing is set for October 22, 2014 at 4:15 PM.
     The U.S. Probation Officer is reminded that, should any objections be
raised by defendant to the PreSentence Report, the Addendum to said
PreSentence Report must specifically identify any unresolved objections, the
grounds for the objections, and the U.S. Probation Officer’s comments on
them, as required by Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(g).       The party that raised the
unresolved objections shall, within twenty-four (24) hours after the
    Case 3:13-cr-00884-CCC Document 34 Filed 08/13/14 Page 2 of 2

Addendum is disclosed, state in writing whether it will insist that the unresolved
objections be ruled upon by the Court. Failure to do so will be deemed by the
Court as a withdrawal of the unresolved objections.
      SO ORDERED.
      At San Juan, Puerto Rico, on August 13, 2014.
