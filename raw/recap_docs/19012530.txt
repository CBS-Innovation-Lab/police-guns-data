                 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                       DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                                     Criminal No. 11-cr-159-JD
Ulrick Lucien


                                   0 R D E R

     On November 16, 2011, a federal grand jury returned an

indictment charging Ulrick Lucien with making a false statement

during the acquisition of a firearm in violation of 18            u.s.c.   §

922(a) (6).    On May 30, 2012, the grand jury returned a

superseding indictment which added a charge of making a false

statement in required information kept by a firearms dealer in

violation of 18 U.S.C.      §   924(a) (1) (A)   ("Count Two").   Lucien

moves to dismiss Count Two, arguing that the government failed to

allege that his false statement was material, which he contends

is an essential element of the crime charged. 1           The government

ob jects to the motion.



     1
      While Lucien's motion to dismiss the superseding indictment
was pending, the grand jury returned a second superseding
indictment. Count Two of the second superseding indictment is
identical to Count Two of the superseding indictment. Because
Count Two in the superseding and second superseding indictments
are the same, the court will consider Lucien's motion.   See,

                                   Discussion

       Lucien moves to dismiss Count Two of the superseding

indictment, charging him with making a false statement in

required information kept by a firearms dealer under 18 U.S.C.                 §

924(a) (1) (A).     Lucien argues that, although the statute does not

explicitly require that a false statement be material, an element

of materiality should be read into the language concerning false

statements made for a dealer's records.            He further argues that

the government did not allege that his false statement, giving a

false address, was material.          The government contends that         §

924(a) (1) (A) does not contain a materiality requirement.

Cortes-Caban, --- F.3d ---, 2012 WL 3241979, at *11 (1st Cir.

    [I]f the meaning of the text is unambiguous," that meaning is

controlling.       United States v. Godin, 534 F.3d 51, 56 (1st Cir.

2008); see also Correa-Ruiz v. Fortuna, 573 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.

2009) .

       Section 924(a) (1) (A) makes it a crime for anyone to

"knowingly make[] any false statement or representation with

respect to the information required by this chapter to be kept in

the records of" a licensed firearms dealer.             The text of the

           Case 1:11-cr-00159-JD Document 34 Filed 09/12/12 Page 3 of 4




statute unambiguously describes which false statements and

representations it prohibits - those made with respect to the

information required to be kept by federally licensed firearms

dealers.     The plain language of § 924(a) (1) (A) unambiguously does

not contain a materiality requirement.           See United States v.

Johnson, 680 F.3d 1140, 1144 (9th Cir. 2012); United States v.

Sullivan, 459 F.2d 993, 994 (8th Cir. 1972).

       In addition,    u [w]here Congress includes particular language

in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of

the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts

intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or

exclusion."      Kucana v. Holder, 130 S. Ct. 827, 838 (2010)

(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).             Here, Lucien is

charged with violating another section of the Gun Control Act,              §

922(a) (6), which contains a materiality requirement in its text.

See§ 922(a) (6)      (prohibiting a false or misleading statement

likely to deceive a firearms dealer uwith respect to any fact

material to the lawfulness of the sale").            Thus, under ordinary

rules of statutory construction, it is presumed that Congress

acted intentionally in including the word umaterial" in §

922(a) (6) but not in§ 924(a) (1) (A), which is part of the same

act.   Therefore, § 924(a) (1) (A) does not contain a materiality

requirement.

                               Conclusion

      For the foregoing reasons, the defendant's motion to dismiss

(document no. 25) is denied.

      SO ORDERED.
