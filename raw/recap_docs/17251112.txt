STATEMENT OF REASONS

Vll COURT DETERM]NATIONS OF RESTITUTION
A m Restitution Not Applicable.
B rI`otal Amount of Restitution:
C Restitution not ordered (Cheek only one.):

l I:I For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under |S U,S.C_ § 3663A` restitution is not ordered because the number oi`
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under lB UtS.C, §3663A(c)(3)(A).

2 |:| For oti`enses t`or which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 UtS.C\ §3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
issues ot` t`aet and relating them to the cause or amount ofthe victims` losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under lS U,S,C § 3663A(e)(3)(B).
3 |:I For other offenses for \vhieh restitution is authorized tinder 18 U S C §3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines restitution is not
ordered because the eomplication and prolongation ot`the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning ofa restitution order outweigh

the needle provide restitution to any victims under tS U S.Ct §3663(a)(t)(B)(ii),
