                      MEMORANDUM AND ORDER RE:
                          PENDING MOTIONS

                            April 18, 2006

PONSOR, D.J.
      Counsel appeared for argument on April 17, 2006 regarding

various pending motions.        Based on counsel’s arguments, the

court rules as follows:

      1. Defendant’s Renewed Motion to Suppress, Dismiss or for

Other Relief. (Docket No. 96)

      This motion is hereby DENIED.         The arguments related to

the relative credibility of the witnesses at the suppression
hearing have been considered by the court and are not of
sufficient significance to justify reconsideration of the

court’s denial of Defendant’s Motion to Suppress.              Moreover,
the prejudice to the defense resulting from any conduct by the
government lacks sufficient magnitude to justify dismissal or

other relief.

      2. Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Count Three. (Docket No.
99)
     Case 3:03-cr-30044-MAP Document 119 Filed 04/18/06 Page 2 of 5



    The court will rule on this motion when counsel appear in
court for a status conference at 9:00 a.m. on the day of trial.

 The government’s opposition to the motion will be filed by
2:00 p.m. on April 19, 2006.        Any reply by Defendant will be
filed by 2:00 p.m. on April 21, 2006.

    3.    Defendant’s Motion for Sanctions for Failure to
Provide L.R. 116.2 Discovery. (Docket No. 100)
    This motion is hereby ALLOWED, to the extent that the

government is hereby prohibited from offering the testimony of
the witness Alex Rankins.       Despite a history of problems with

pretrial disclosure in this case, the government has failed to

comply with Local Rule 116.2 regarding timely provision of
discovery related to this witness.            The motion is DENIED,

without prejudice, with regard to any further requests for

sanctions.   The extent of the government’s failure to comply

with the rules and the level of prejudice to Defendant do not

justify any harsher sanctions.



    4.   Defendant’s Motion for Daubert Hearing and to Exclude

Government Expert Testimomy . (Docket No. 101)
    This motion is hereby ALLOWED, to the extent that the
court will not permit the government to offer expert testimony

from any law enforcement agents regarding the relationship
between firearms and drugs.      This information can be presented

through fact testimony and argument. No need exists for expert
testimony on this point.       The motion is ALLOWED with regard to

the request for a hearing prior to any testimony from a law
enforcement officer that the 4.1               grams   of   crack    cocaine
possessed by Defendant was necessarily possessed with the

intention to distribute it.
       5.   Defendant’s Motion in Limine Regarding Any Prior Bad

Acts. (Docket No. 102)

       This motion is hereby DENIED, without prejudice.                  The

issues raised by this motion are addressed, at least in part,
by the court’s rulings on the government’s motions in limine

below.

       6.      Government’s Motion in Limine Pursuant to Fed. R.
Evid. 609. (Docket No. 106)

       This motion is hereby DENIED, without prejudice to its

reconsideration if Defendant seeks to testify at trial.
       7. Government’s Amended Motion in Limine Regarding 404(b)

Evidence. (Docket No. 110)
       This motion is hereby DENIED, to the extent that the court

will     not     permit   testimony       regarding    Defendant’s      prior
convictions as part of the government’s case-in-chief or any
general testimony that Defendant has possessed guns in the

past. With regard to the witness Shaver, this motion is hereby
DENIED, without prejudice. The court will need to hear further

details with regard to Shaver’s testimony and whether its
probative     value   outweighs     its   potentially      unfair     and

prejudicial impact.
    8.      Defendant’s Emergency Motion to Preserve Evidence.

(Docket No. 116)
    This motion is hereby ALLOWED.          All documents, physical

objects, statements, policies, and anything else related to the
fingerprint evidence in this case will be preserved and will

be made available to the defense in a secure location no later

than April 19, 2006.




    9.      Defendant’s Motion in Limine to Divide Count One.
(Docket No. 117)

    This motion is hereby ALLOWED, to the extent that the

court will submit special verdict forms to the jury that will
permit them to indicate whether the government’s case has been
proved beyond a reasonable doubt as to each of the four items

mentioned in this count: the .38 caliber firearm, the .38
caliber ammunition, the .25 caliber firearm, and the .25
caliber ammunition.

    Finally, regarding Defendant’s counsel’s letter to the

effect that he may call the prosecuting Assistant U.S. Attorney
as a witness in this case, the court can only observe that,

absent unusual and pressing circumstances, this will not be
permitted.

    It is So Ordered.
