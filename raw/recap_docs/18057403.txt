     ORDER DENYING PRO SE MOTION TO APPOINT COUNSEL AND
                MOTION TO REDUCE SENTENCE

       On March 24, 2014, the Court sentenced Ryan Orton to 180 months concurrent

incarceration, six years supervised release, and a $300 special assessment for

engaging in a conspiracy to import controlled substances, engaging in another

conspiracy to launder money, and being a felon in possession of a firearm.1 J. (ECF

No. 76) (J.). Mr. Orton attempted to appeal the sentence to the Court of Appeals for

the First Circuit; however, on April 24, 2015, the Court of Appeals enforced the terms

of the plea agreement’s appeal waiver and affirmed the sentence. J. (ECF No. 84).

On October 13, 2015, Mr. Orton filed a pro se motion for appointment of counsel and

a motion to reduce sentence. Mot. for New Counsel (ECF No. 89).2




1       The Court did not fine Mr. Orton. J. at 5.
2       Although Mr. Orton has captioned his motion as only a motion for new counsel, in the body of
the motion, he explains that he would like a new lawyer “to be appointed . . . for my Amendment 782
motion.” Mot. for New Counsel at 1. The Court has treated the motion for new counsel also as a motion
for reduction of sentence under Amendment 782 because the response to the motion for new counsel
is interwoven with the merits of the motion for reduction of sentence.

       The Court denies Mr. Orton’s motions because he is not entitled to a sentence

reduction under Amendment 782.3              The Court calculated Mr. Orton’s guideline

sentence range as follows:

       (1) The base offense level was 36 under U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(a)(1);

       (2) As Mr. Orton was convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1956, two levels were

           added under U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(b)(2)(B), bringing the offense level to

           38;

       (3) As Mr. Orton was an organizer or leader in a criminal activity

           involving five or more participants, four levels were added under

           U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a), bringing the offense level to 42;

       (4) Mr. Orton accepted responsibility for the offense and his offense level

           was reduced three levels under U.S.S.G. § 3E.1 to 39;

       (5) Mr. Orton was a career offender and his criminal history category

           was Category VI under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(b);

       (6) For a total offense level of 39 and a criminal history Category VI, the

           applicable guideline range was 360 months to life; however, the life

           term was reduced by the statutory maximum of 720 months,

           reducing the guideline range to 360 or 720 months.




3      Effective November 1, 2014, the United States Sentencing Commission reduced the Base
Offense Levels for numerous controlled substances by two levels. United States Sentencing
Commission, Guidelines Manual, Suppl. to App. C, Amendment 782, at 65 (Nov. 1, 2014). See also id.,
Amendment 788, at 87 (Amendment 782 may be applied retroactively).

Statement of Reasons Attach. 1 (ECF No. 77) (Findings Affecting Sentencing). The

Government moved for a reduction under U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1, and the Court sentenced

Mr. Orton to 180 months concurrent incarceration. J. at 2.

      The critical question is whether the two-level reduction authorized under

Amendments 782 and 788 would change Mr. Orton’s Guideline calculation.

Unfortunately for Mr. Orton, it would not. To arrive at this conclusion, the Court has

unpacked the original base offense level of 36 and discovered that it was calculated

by starting with a base offense level of 32 under U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(4). This was

based on Mr. Orton’s importation of 2,339.78 kilograms of marijuana equivalent.

Third Revised Presentence Investigation Report ¶ 13. The Court enhanced level 32 by

two levels for possession of a firearm during the drug offense under U.S.S.G. §

2D1.1(b)(1) and by two levels for importing drugs and committing the offense as part

of a pattern of criminal conduct engaged in as a livelihood under U.S.S.G §

2D1.1(b)(14)(C), resulting in a base offense level of 36. Id. As earlier noted, with

further enhancements and reductions, Mr. Orton’s total offense level was 39. Id. ¶

22. Because Mr. Orton was a career offender, his criminal history category was VI.

Id. ¶ 31 (citing U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(b)).

      Amendment 782 reduces Mr. Orton’s base offense level calculated on drug

quantity alone from 32 to 30. See U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(4). However, the remaining

calculations apply with equal force, resulting in a net two-level reduction in the total

offense level from 39 to 37. Mr. Orton’s criminal history category remains VI. Under

the Guidelines, a total offense level of 37 and a criminal history category VI results

Case 1:12-cr-00117-JAW Document 90 Filed 10/20/15 Page 4 of 4            PageID #: 298



in a Guideline range of 360 to life, the same Guideline range originally calculated at

Mr. Orton’s March 24, 2014 sentencing hearing, capped by the statutory maximum

of 720 months. PSR ¶¶ 57-58.

      Because the two-level reduction under Amendment 782 does not affect the

Guideline sentence range in Mr. Orton’s case, he is not entitled to relief. As he is not

entitled to relief, the Court also denies Mr. Orton’s request for appointment of

counsel.

      The Court DENIES Ryan Orton’s Pro Se Motion for Appointment of Counsel

and Motion to Reduce Sentence (ECF No. 89).
