                    ORDER ON DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL

          This Court denies Defendant Larry Dean Alexander’s Rule 33 motion for new trial as

  untimely.

          I.       Statement of Facts

           On September 9, 2005, after a one-day jury trial, Larry Dean Alexander was found guilty

  of three counts of unlawful firearm possession. 1 Jury Verdict (Docket # 69). On October 24,

  2005, Mr. Alexander filed a letter in this Court seeking new counsel to “get a mistrial”. Def.’s

  Pro Se Motion to Appoint Counsel (Docket # 72). Following a hearing on November 2, 2005,

  this Court granted Mr. Alexander’s motion and appointed Attorney Marvin Glazier as

  replacement counsel. (Docket #s 75, 76). By an undated letter that this Court received on

  November 9, 2005, Mr. Alexander wrote that he “would like to have a motion to challenge the

  Jury’s verdict” and asserted that three witnesses “have lied either on the stand, on a legal

  statement, or both.” Def.’s 11-9-2005 letter (Docket # 80 – Attach. 1). Though shared with

  counsel, this letter was never formally docketed. 2 On April 12, 2006, Attorney Glazier filed a



  1
    Specifically: violation of 26 U.S.C. § 5861(d), Possession of an unregistered short-barreled shotgun; violation of
  18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), Possession of a firearm by a person previously convicted of a felony; and violation of 18
  U.S.C. § 922(g)(9), Possession of a firearm by a person previously convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic
  violence.
  2
    Mr. Alexander followed up by letter dated November 21, 2005 in which he asked the Court “to consider perjury
  charges on the three law witnesses in my case.” Again, although shared with counsel, the letter was not docketed.

  motion pursuant to Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, seeking a new trial on

  the ground that the verdict was against the weight of the credible evidence and results in a

  miscarriage of justice. Def.’s Am. Mot. for New Trial (Docket # 79).

         II.     Discussion

         Rule 33, governing new trials, provides as follows:

         (a) Defendant’s Motion. Upon the defendant’s motion, the court may vacate any
             judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires. If the case was
             tried without a jury, the court may take additional testimony and enter a new
             judgment.
         (b) Time to File.
           (1) Newly Discovered Evidence. Any motion for a new trial grounded on newly
                discovered evidence must be filed within 3 years after the verdict or finding of
                guilty. If an appeal is pending, the court may not grant a mo tion for a new trial
                until the appellate court remands the case.
           (2) Other Grounds. Any motion for a new trial grounded on any reason other than
                newly discovered evidence must be filed within 7 days after the verdict or finding
                of guilty.

  Fed. R. Crim. P. 33 (emphasis supplied). The time provisions of Rule 33 wait for no defendant.

  The First Circuit has characterized the seven-day bar as “jurisdictional”, and written that the

  district court is “without discretion to grant a motion for new trial that is not timely filed”.

  United States v. Lema, 909 F.2d 561, 565 (1st Cir. 1990). See also United States v. Glenn, 389

  F.3d 283, 287 (1st Cir. 2004); United States v. Diaz, 300 F.3d 66, 78 (1st Cir. 2002).

         Under Rule 33, Defendant’s motion must either be grounded on newly discovered

  evidence or filed within seven days of the verdict. Defendant’s motion of April 12, 2006 is well

  past seven days of the September 9, 2005 verdict.            The motion purports to amend Mr.

  Alexander’s November 9, 2005 letter, but even if, as defense counsel requests, this Court were to




                                                  2
Case 1:04-cr-00064-JAW Document 81 Filed 05/04/06 Page 3 of 4                                    PageID #: 385



  construe his pro se letter as a Rule 33 Motion, November 9th is two months post verdict, and

  outside the narrow time limit of Rule 33(b)(2).3 See Def.’s Am. Mot. for New Trial at 1.

           To escape the iron grip of Rule 33(b)(2), then, the motion must be grounded on newly

  discovered evidence. Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(b)(1). But, neither the Amended Motion nor the

  November 9, 2005 letter makes any claim of newly discovered evidence. Defendant’s letter of

  November 9th challenges the credibility of four Government’s witnesses based on allegations

  that their trial testimony was inherently contradictory, conflicted with previous statements, or

  was otherwise unbelievable. Def.’s 11-9-2005 letter. Each allegation, however, is based on

  information readily apparent to Defendant at trial, not “newly discovered”. See, e.g., United

  States v. Casas, 425 F.3d 23, 53 (1st Cir. 2005)(“To prevail on a motion for a new trial under

  Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 on the basis of newly discovered evidence, the movant

  must show that ‘(1) the evidence was unknown or unavailable to the defendant at the time of

  trial….’”). The Amended Motion of April 12th also focuses on the credibility of the witnesses

  based on asserted inconsistencies. While the Amended Motion focuses as well on Defendant’s

  knowledge of the actual length of the shotgun barrel on the date of the transaction, Mr.

  Alexander has made no attempt to show that this evidence was “newly discovered” within the

  meaning of Rule 33.4 His motion is untimely.

           III.     Conclusion

           Defendant’s Amended Motion for a New Trial (Docket # 79) is DENIED.

           SO ORDERED.

  3
    The same is true for the October 24, 2005 letter. It would be a greater leap to construe Mr. Alexander’s October
  24, 2005 letter seeking new counsel as a motion for new trial, since it requests a new lawyer to “try to get a
  mistrial.” Def.’s Pro Se Mot. to Appoint Counsel. This letter was docketed as a motion to appoint new counsel and
  the Defendant has never asserted the October 24, 2005 letter should be deemed a motion for new trial. Even if it
  were, the October 24, 2005 letter is beyond time as well.
  4
    If this Court were to construe the October 24, 2005 letter as a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the result
  would be the same. Lema, 909 F.2d at 566; United States v. Merserve, No. 99-19-B, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8284 at
  * 8 (D. Me. June 9, 2000).
