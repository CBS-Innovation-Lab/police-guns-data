                               OPINION AND ORDER

WILLIAM E. SMITH, United States District Judge.

       Defendant     Jason    Mitchner    is    charged    with:         (1)   being   a

felon in possession of firearms and ammunition, see 18 U.S.C. §§

922(g)(1)      and   924(a)(2);    and    (2)    possession         of   cocaine   with

intent    to   distribute     within     1,000   feet     of    a    school,    see    21

U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C) and 860(a).                 (Indictment, ECF No.

1.)      Now   before   the    Court   is    Mitchner’s        Motion     to   Suppress

Evidence and Statements (“Motion to Suppress”) (ECF No. 42).

For the reasons set forth below, that motion is DENIED.

I.     Facts

       On September 19, 2013, the Court held a hearing on the

instant motion.         The first witness called to testify, and the

only   one     possessing     firsthand     knowledge     of    the      investigation

leading to Mitchner’s arrest and the search of his residence,
Case 1:11-cr-00124-S-PAS Document 51 Filed 11/05/13 Page 2 of 19 PageID #: 184



was Detective Martin Hames. 1             Detective Hames testified that he

has    worked      for   the   Providence       Police    Department    (“PPD”)     for

approximately        twelve    years,     and    has     worked   in   the   area   of

narcotics and organized crime for more than eight years.                      During

this       time,    Detective     Hames     has     investigated       hundreds     of

narcotics cases and at least seventy-five cases involving guns.

       Detective Hames’s involvement in the instant case began in

early March 2011, when he and his partner, Detective John Bento,

received information from a confidential informant (“CI”) that a

man named “Jay” was selling cocaine out of a house on Gallatin

       1
       Having had the opportunity to observe Detective Hames at
the hearing, this Court credits his testimony. Defense counsel
attempted to impeach Hames by pointing out certain omissions
from his search warrant affidavit, incident report, and witness
statement. However, none of the omitted information was crucial
to the two main issues in dispute:         (1) whether there was
probable cause to support the search warrant for 108 Gallatin
Street and (2) whether the Providence Police Department’s
detention of Mitchner at the gas station constituted an arrest
without probable cause.     See United States v. Jones, 187 F.3d
210, 215 (1st Cir. 1999) (affirming the district court’s
favorable credibility determination where “the points upon which
the troopers’ testimony differed . . . generally were collateral
facts not central to establishing whether the troopers had a
reasonable suspicion that justified stopping the [vehicle],
whether they had probable cause to arrest [the suspect], or
whether they violated his Fourth or Fifth Amendment rights in
the process”).
     Similarly,    the    factual   discrepancies    between   the
government’s    memorandum   and   Detective   Hames’s   testimony
regarding Mitchner’s initial detention, while troubling, do not
warrant discrediting Hames.      The Court accepts the Assistant
United States Attorney’s explanation that, in drafting the
memorandum, he drew certain unsupported “inferences” from what
he had been told by the witness. (See Mot. to Suppress Hr’g Tr.
82, Sept. 19, 2013.)

Street in Providence, Rhode Island.                 The CI described Jay as a

tall,   heavy       set   black    male   with    dreadlocks.         The   CI    had    a

criminal history and was assisting law enforcement in hopes of

obtaining favorable treatment on charges pending against him.

Detective Hames also testified that the CI had provided him with

reliable information in the past.

       After receiving this tip, Detective Hames searched the PPD

database for individuals whose names begin with “Ja” and who

live on Gallatin Street.             The search identified Jason Mitchner,

residing at 108 Gallatin Street.                 Detective Hames confirmed this

address by searching for Mitchner’s name in the Department of

Corrections database.             As a result of these searches, Detective

Hames obtained a photograph of Mitchner, which was a close match

to the physical description provided by the CI.                       Later, the CI

confirmed that the photograph depicted the person he knew as

Jay.    Detective Hames also recognized Mitchner as someone he had

attended      high    school      with.        Additionally,       Detective      Hames

checked    Mitchner’s        criminal     history       and    discovered     multiple

prior convictions.

       Beginning      the    week    of   March     7,    2011,    the      PPD   began

conducting     “sporadic       surveillance”       of    108   Gallatin     Street      to

confirm that Mitchner was still living there.                     (Mot. to Suppress

Hr’g    Tr.    8,    Sept.     19,   2013.)         During     this    surveillance,



                                           3
Case 1:11-cr-00124-S-PAS Document 51 Filed 11/05/13 Page 4 of 19 PageID #: 186



Detective Hames observed Mitchner enter and exit the side door

of the house.

      Later   that   same    week,      detectives         decided    to   arrange    a

controlled buy.       Detectives Hames and Bento met the CI at a

prearranged location.        They searched the CI and his vehicle to

ensure that he did not have any contraband.                     They also gave the

CI money to complete the controlled buy.                       After the meeting,

detectives    followed      the    CI    to       108   Gallatin     Street.     Upon

arriving at that address, the CI waited in his vehicle for a few

minutes until Mitchner pulled into the driveway.                        Mitchner and

the CI exited their cars, had a brief conversation, and entered

108   Gallatin   Street.          The   CI       emerged   a   few   minutes   later.

Detectives followed the CI back to the prearranged location,

where he handed Detective Hames a substance that later tested

positive for the presence of cocaine.                   The CI said he purchased

the substance from Jay.

      Finally,    Detective         Hames         prepared     a     search    warrant

application for 108 Gallatin Street.                    His affidavit in support

of the warrant relates, with little detail, the CI’s tip that

“Jay” was distributing cocaine from 108 Gallatin Street.                             It

does not disclose the CI’s criminal history or his history of

providing reliable information.                  Next, the affidavit describes

detectives’ identification of “Jay” as Mitchner and the CI’s

subsequent confirmation of that identification.                       It also states

                                             4
Case 1:11-cr-00124-S-PAS Document 51 Filed 11/05/13 Page 5 of 19 PageID #: 187



that the Department of Corrections database listed Mitchner’s

address as 108 Gallatin Street, and that Mitchner was observed

at that address during subsequent surveillance.                           Finally, and

most       significantly,    Detective       Hames’s          affidavit    relates      the

circumstances of the controlled buy.                      The affidavit does not,

however, indicate that Mitchner arrived at 108 Gallatin Street

and interacted with the CI prior to the controlled buy.                            At the

hearing on Defendant’s motion, Hames freely admitted that the

affidavit does not contain every detail of the investigation.

           On March 11, 2011, the state judge issued a warrant to

search      108   Gallatin   Street     as       well    as   Mitchner’s       person   for

“[n]arcotics,       firearms,      monies         and    goods     derived      from    the

illegal sales of narcotics, as well as Paperwork [sic] showing

bills and records as to the occupant of said dwelling, where

proceeds of narcotics sales may be stored.” 2                    (Gov’t’s Ex. 1.)

       Detectives     set    out   to   execute         the    warrant    on    March   16,

2011.       They followed Mitchner to an industrial park in Cranston,

Rhode Island and then back to Providence, where Mitchner pulled

into a gas station.          Detectives Hames and Bento pulled their car

behind      Mitchner’s.       Detective          Hames    exited    his    vehicle      and

approached Mitchner, with at least two other officers present.


       2
       While Mitchner contends that the affidavit did not create
probable cause to believe that evidence of a crime would be
found at 108 Gallatin Street, he does not raise any argument
regarding the scope of the warrant.

Case 1:11-cr-00124-S-PAS Document 51 Filed 11/05/13 Page 6 of 19 PageID #: 188



Detective Hames identified himself, showed his badge, and asked

Mitchner if he remembered him from school.                          Detective Hames then

told   Mitchner        that     the       PPD   had    a     search     warrant       for      his

residence and asked if there was anything in the house they

should know about.            Mitchner responded, “there might be a couple

of   guns.”          (Mot.     to     Suppress        Hr’g    Tr.      17.)         During     his

interactions         with     detectives,           Mitchner     was     “calm,       relaxed,

cooperative,         [and]    very       respectful.”          (Id.)         At   this    point,

detectives patted Mitchner down, handcuffed him, and placed him

in the back of their vehicle.                   The government concedes that this

constituted a de facto arrest.                  Once he was in the car, Mitchner

asked Detective Hames not to break the door to the house down

and offered to let detectives use his keys.

       Detectives transported Mitchner to 108 Gallatin Street to

execute    the       warrant.            Mitchner’s         demeanor     continued        to    be

“calm,” “respectful,” and “relaxed.”                         (Id. at 22.)            Detectives

Hames and Bento walked Mitchner into the kitchen, while the rest

of the detectives searched the house.                           Within a few minutes,

they   found     a    gun.          At   this   point,        Detective       Hames      advised

Mitchner   of        his    Miranda       rights      and    asked     him     if    there     was

anything   else       in     the    house.       Again,       Mitchner        indicated      that

“there might be a couple of guns.”                           (Id. at 21.)           The search

proceeded, and, ultimately, detectives recovered three firearms,



                                                6
Case 1:11-cr-00124-S-PAS Document 51 Filed 11/05/13 Page 7 of 19 PageID #: 189



ammunition, narcotics, and bagging material, among other things.

(See Gov’t’s Ex. 1.)

       Upon     completion        of     the       search,     Mitchner         was        again

relocated, this time to one of the interrogation rooms in the

PPD station, where he was interviewed by Agent Wing Chau of the

Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

II.    Discussion

       Mitchner     seeks    to    suppress         all    evidence        seized     by    and

statements given to law enforcement as a result of the search

and arrest that occurred on March 16, 2011.                             He raises three

arguments in support of his motion:                       (1) there was no probable

cause   to     support     the    search       warrant;      (2)     the      detention         of

Mitchner       at   the   gas     station      constituted         an    arrest       without

probable cause; and (3) Mitchner’s statements to law enforcement

were    involuntary       and     must    be       suppressed      as      fruit      of        the

poisonous tree.           Each of these arguments will be addressed in

turn.

       A.     Probable Cause

       Probable cause exists to support a search warrant where,

“given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit,” “there

is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime

will be found in a particular place.”                        Illinois v. Gates, 462

U.S.    213,     238   (1983).         Probable       cause     is      not    akin        to    a

preponderance of the evidence standard.                      See Texas v. Brown, 460

                                               7
Case 1:11-cr-00124-S-PAS Document 51 Filed 11/05/13 Page 8 of 19 PageID #: 190



U.S. 730, 742 (1983).          In reviewing a magistrate’s determination

on this point, the Court must “ensure that the magistrate had a

substantial basis for . . . conclud[ing] that probable cause

existed.”     Gates,     462    U.S.   at    238-39   (internal     citation    and

quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original).

      Where information obtained from an informant serves as the

basis for a probable cause determination, the First Circuit has

identified    a     non-exhaustive      list   of     factors    for   courts   to

consider:

      (1) whether the affidavit establishes the probable
      veracity and basis of knowledge of persons supplying
      hearsay   information;   (2)  whether   an  informant’s
      statements reflect firsthand knowledge; (3) whether
      some or all [of] the informant’s factual statements
      were corroborated wherever reasonable and practicable
      (e.g., through police surveillance); and (4) whether a
      law    enforcement    affiant   assessed,   from    his
      professional standpoint, experience, and expertise,
      the probable significance of the informant’s provided
      information. Because [n]one of these factors is
      indispensable, a stronger showing of supporting
      evidence as to one or more factors may effectively
      counterbalance a lesser showing as to others.

United States v. Trinh, 665 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2011) (internal

citations     and     quotation        marks    omitted)        (alterations    in

original).     The First Circuit has also made clear that “[t]he

risk that the informant is lying or in error need not be wholly

eliminated.       Rather, what is needed is that the probability of a

lying or inaccurate informer has been sufficiently reduced by

corroborative       facts   and   observations.”          United      States    v.

Khounsavanh,      113     F.3d     279,    284      (1st    Cir.      1997)        (internal

citation and quotation marks omitted).

      In the instant case, the affidavit presented to the state

judge admittedly provided no information about the CI’s past

reliability     or      basis      of     knowledge.             However,      detectives

corroborated    this      tip     by    arranging     a    controlled         buy    at   108

Gallatin     Street.             The    First       Circuit       has,        in     similar

circumstances, found probable cause to support a search warrant.

See United States v. Materas, 483 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir. 2007);

Khounsavanh,      113     F.3d     at     285-86.          Contrary      to    Mitchner’s

suggestions, the fact that the police did not actually observe

the exchange is not determinative.                  See Khounsavanh, 113 F.3d at

286 (noting that “the detective was able to watch the informant

enter and leave the building through its front door, but did not

follow the informant into the building and thus was unable to

verify   with   certainty        which     apartment       was    the    source      of   the

drugs (or even whether the drugs had been secreted elsewhere in

the   building,      as    the     defendant        had    hypothesized)”).               The

Khounsavanh court also squarely rejected Mitchner’s contention

that the lack of information regarding the CI’s past reliability

precludes a finding of probable cause.                           See id.           Here, the

affidavit    states       that    detectives     observed         the    CI    enter      108

Gallatin Street and emerge a few minutes later.                             Upon meeting

the detectives at a prearranged location, the CI met up with

                                            9
Case 1:11-cr-00124-S-PAS Document 51 Filed 11/05/13 Page 10 of 19 PageID #: 192



Michner, entered the house, and returned to meet with officers,

then produced cocaine which he said was purchased from Mitchner.

This information is sufficient to create probable cause.

        Mitchner cites two First Circuit cases for the proposition

that “[a] warrant application must demonstrate probable cause to

believe that (1) a crime has been committed-the ‘commission’

element,       and   (2)   enumerated     evidence   of   the   offense   will   be

found     at    the    place    to   be    searched-the      so-called    ‘nexus’

element.”       United States v. Ribeiro, 397 F.3d 43, 48 (1st Cir.

2005) (quoting United States v. Feliz, 182 F.3d 82, 86 (1st Cir.

1999)).        He proceeds to argue that the nexus element has not

been satisfied here.           However, Ribeiro and Feliz are inapposite.

Both of these cases involved warrant applications predicated on

controlled buys occurring somewhere other than the place to be

searched.       See Ribeiro, 397 F.3d at 45; Feliz, 182 F.3d at 84.

Here, by contrast, the controlled buy occurred at 108 Gallatin

Street, the same location that was the subject of the search

warrant.        See United States v. Rodrigue, 560 F.3d 29, 34 (1st

Cir. 2009) (distinguishing Feliz on the grounds that it involved

a search “justified by a suspect’s connection to a place,” as

opposed to a direct connection between the place to be searched

and the suspected criminal activity).                In these circumstances,

the nexus element was clearly satisfied.                  See Materas, 483 F.3d

at 32 (“Common sense dictates that evidence of [the suspect’s]

                                          10
Case 1:11-cr-00124-S-PAS Document 51 Filed 11/05/13 Page 11 of 19 PageID #: 193



possession could probably be found in the location where he sold

drugs two days before.”).

      Detective Hames’s affidavit is not remotely comparable to

the type of conclusory document condemned by the Supreme Court

in Nathanson v. United States, 290 U.S. 41 (1933).                  There, the

Court held insufficient an agent’s statement that “he has cause

to suspect and does believe” that certain contraband was at the

premises to be searched.           Id. at 44.    In the present case, by

contrast, the affidavit set out sufficient facts, namely the

circumstances of the controlled buy, from which the state judge

could make an independent probable cause determination.

      Even assuming, for the sake of argument, that the state

judge   incorrectly     found     probable   cause    to   search   the   house,

Mitchner is not entitled to suppression.              This is because, “[i]n

the ordinary case, an officer cannot be expected to question the

magistrate’s probable-cause determination or his judgment that

the   form   of   the   warrant    is   technically   sufficient.”        United

States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 921 (1984).              Thus, under the good

faith exception to the exclusionary rule, suppression of the

fruits of a search conducted pursuant to an invalid warrant is

not required so long as the officer’s reliance on the warrant

was “objectively reasonable.”           Id. at 922.    In the present case,

it cannot fairly be said that the affidavit is “so lacking in

indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its

                                        11
Case 1:11-cr-00124-S-PAS Document 51 Filed 11/05/13 Page 12 of 19 PageID #: 194



existence entirely unreasonable.”                 Id. at 923 (internal citation

and quotation marks omitted).                  For this reason, suppression is

inappropriate.

      In    addition      to     generally       taking    issue   with    the    state

judge’s probable cause determination, Mitchner also presents the

“further concern” that the affidavit fails to mention the CI’s

criminal        record   or    his    motivation     for    cooperating        with   the

police.      (Mot. to Suppress 13.)              On this point, Mitchner cites

United States v. Hall, 113 F.3d 157 (9th Cir. 1997).                       There, the

Ninth Circuit, after a Franks hearing before the district court,

held that suppression was required where an officer testifying

at    the    search      warrant       hearing     deliberately      or    recklessly

withheld an informant’s prior conviction for falsely reporting a

crime.

      As    a    preliminary         matter,   Mitchner     has    not    requested      a

Franks      hearing      in    the     present     case.      Moreover,        Hall     is

distinguishable in many significant respects.                       First, in Hall,

outside of the informant’s testimony, there was no evidence to

support a finding of probable cause.                       Id. at 158.         Here, by

contrast, the police corroborated the information provided by

the   CI    by    arranging      a    controlled    buy.      Second,     in    Hall,    a

trooper was directly questioned under oath about the informant’s

criminal history.             He listed many prior convictions, but failed

to mention the conviction for false reporting.                           Id.     In the

                                           12
Case 1:11-cr-00124-S-PAS Document 51 Filed 11/05/13 Page 13 of 19 PageID #: 195



present case, the affiant did not give oral testimony, and did

not provide an incomplete answer to a direct question regarding

the CI’s criminal history.                  In these circumstances, the non-

disclosure is far less troubling.                  Third and finally, the nature

of   the    undisclosed       prior       conviction     in     Hall       “suggested      the

possibility        that    [the   informant]       would      lie    to     the   police   to

frame      an   innocent     man.”        Id.     at   160.         Here,    by   contrast,

Detective Hames testified that the CI’s prior convictions were

for drug offenses.           See United States v. Adler, 152 F.3d 929, at

*3   n.1    (9th    Cir.    1998)     (Table)      (distinguishing           Hall    on    the

grounds that it “concern[ed] the omission of an informant’s past

crimes that involved dishonesty”).                      In any event, Mitchner’s

argument        fails   because     the    controlled         buy    was    sufficient     to

establish        probable     cause,        notwithstanding           the     CI’s    prior

convictions.        See United States v. Legault, 323 F. Supp. 2d 217,

227 (D. Mass. 2004) (declining to hold a Franks hearing because

the affiant’s omission of an informant’s criminal background and

request for leniency “do not fatally undermine the affidavit’s

showing of probable cause”).                Indeed, the fact that the CI was

cooperating with police to obtain favorable treatment on charges

pending against him would have bolstered, not diminished, his

credibility.        See id. at 226-27 (citing cases).

      B.    Detention

      Mitchner’s       next   argument        is    predicated      upon   the   Supreme

Court’s recent decision in Bailey v. United States, 133 S. Ct.

1031 (2013).          There, the Court held that detention incident to

the execution of a search warrant is limited to “the immediate

vicinity of the premises to be searched.”                        Id. at 1042.         The

lawfulness       of     detentions       outside       this     limited      area     “is

controlled by other standards, including, of course, a brief

stop for questioning based on reasonable suspicion under Terry

or an arrest based on probable cause.”                  Id.

      The government does not attempt to justify the detention at

issue here under Bailey.                Rather, it argues that detectives’

initial    interactions       with      Mitchner      constituted      a   permissible

Terry stop.       The First Circuit has explained that “[i]nteraction

between law enforcement officials and citizens generally falls

within three tiers of Fourth Amendment analysis, depending on

the level of police intrusion into a person’s privacy”:                               (1)

“interaction of such minimally intrusive nature that it does not

trigger    the    protections      of    the       Fourth   Amendment”;      (2)    Terry

stops; and (3) arrests.            United States v. Young, 105 F.3d 1, 5-6

(1st Cir. 1997).            Here, detectives’ initial interactions with

Mitchner     appear      to   fall      within       the    first    tier.         Police

approached       Mitchner     at   a    gas    station,       informed     him   of   the

outstanding search warrant, and asked him what was in the house.

                                           14
Case 1:11-cr-00124-S-PAS Document 51 Filed 11/05/13 Page 15 of 19 PageID #: 197



It is far from clear that this conduct implicated the Fourth

Amendment at all.           See id. at 6 (“Police may approach citizens

in public spaces and ask them questions without triggering the

protections of the Fourth Amendment.”).

      However, the Court need not reach this issue because, even

if detectives’ interactions with Mitchner constituted a seizure,

it was a valid Terry stop, not a de facto arrest.                 Under Terry:

      based   merely   on   a  reasonable   and   articulable
      suspicion, a police officer may make a brief stop or
      ‘seizure’ of an individual to investigate suspected
      past or present criminal activity.      Such a seizure
      will be upheld as constitutionally permissible so long
      as it was justified at its inception, and, if so, . .
      . the action taken was reasonably related in scope to
      the circumstances which justified the interference.

United States v. Acosta-Colon, 157 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir. 1998)

(internal citation and quotation marks omitted) (alteration in

original).      Here, the CI’s tip, corroborated by the subsequent

controlled buy, clearly created reasonable suspicion sufficient

to    support    a    Terry     stop.        Moreover,     the    detention      was

significantly        less     intrusive      than     an    arrest.           “[A]n

investigatory        stop    constitutes     a   de   facto      arrest   when     a

reasonable man in the suspect’s position would have understood

his situation . . . to be tantamount to being under arrest.”

Id.    (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).                    During

his brief initial communications with detectives, Mitchner was

not handcuffed or otherwise detained, and it would have been


                                        15
Case 1:11-cr-00124-S-PAS Document 51 Filed 11/05/13 Page 16 of 19 PageID #: 198



unreasonable for him to understand his situation as a de facto

arrest. 3

       After Mitchner told officers that there might be guns at

the house, he was handcuffed and placed in the cruiser.                    At this

point,       the     government     concedes    that      an   arrest    occurred.

However, this arrest was supported by probable cause.                     In light

of Detective Hames’s knowledge of Mitchner’s criminal record,

Mitchner’s statement created probable cause to arrest him as a

felon in possession of a firearm.              Separately, the CI’s tip and

controlled buy created probable cause to arrest Mitchner on drug

charges.          In this context, it is important to note that certain

details omitted from the search warrant affidavit but known to

the officers, most notably the CI’s past reliability and the

fact       that    Mitchner   had   arrived    at   108    Gallatin     Street   and

interacted with the CI immediately prior to the controlled buy,

further support a finding of probable cause to arrest.                           See

United States v. Perez, No. CR. 09-029 S, 2009 WL 3398488, at *5

(D.R.I. Oct. 20, 2009) (“The information given by the CI, who

had successfully worked with the ATF in the past, combined with


       3
        While Mitchner does not raise any Miranda argument, it is
worth noting that he was not in custody when he made his first
incriminating statement to police. See Jones, 187 F.3d at 217-
18 (“The decisive issue in the custody inquiry is ‘whether there
was a formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the
degree associated with a formal arrest.’” (quoting Stansbury v.
California, 511 U.S. 318, 322 (1994)).      Mitchner’s subsequent
statements to law enforcement were preceded by Miranda warnings.
                                         16
Case 1:11-cr-00124-S-PAS Document 51 Filed 11/05/13 Page 17 of 19 PageID #: 199



the    information      obtained    from      the    controlled        buy,   furnished

probable cause to believe that [the suspect] was trafficking in

narcotics.”).

       The fact that Detective Hames appears to have subjectively

believed he was detaining Mitchner in order to facilitate the

search of 108 Gallatin Street is not determinative.                           As Judge

Tauro of the District of Massachusetts recently pointed out in a

similar context, “[t]he Supreme Court has emphasized that the

probable cause inquiry is objective.”                     United States v. Dixon,

CRIM.A. 11-10218-JLT, 2013 WL 1821613, at *3 (D. Mass. Apr. 29,

2013)    (citing      Devenpeck     v.    Alford,         543   U.S.    146   (2004)).

Indeed, “[t]he fact that the officer does not have the state of

mind    which    is   hypothecated       by   the   reasons     which     provide    the

legal justification for the officer’s action does not invalidate

the     action    taken     as     long       as    the    circumstances,        viewed

objectively, justify that action.”                  Id. (quoting Devenpeck, 543

U.S. at 153).         Judge Tauro rejected an argument based on Bailey,

identical to the one raised here.                    He explained, “This court

need not consider whether Defendant’s detention was justified as

incident to execution of a search warrant because the officers

had probable cause to arrest Defendant.”                        Id. at *4.          This

analysis applies in the present case as well.

      C.      Mitchner’s Statements

      Mitchner raises two arguments regarding his statements to

law enforcement.           First, he claims that those statements must be

suppressed because they were involuntary.                               “When charged with

determining        whether      a    confession          was    voluntary,       an   inquiring

court    must      sift    through      the        totality       of    the     circumstances,

including       both      the    nature       of       the     police    activity     and     the

defendant’s situation.”                United States v. Hughes, 640 F.3d 428,

438   (1st    Cir.       2011).        Relevant          considerations          include      “the

length and nature of the questioning, any promises or threats

made,   and     any      deprivation         of    essentials          (e.g.,    food,   water,

sleep, bathroom facilities) imposed upon the suspect,” as well

as “an appraisal of the defendant’s attributes, such as his age,

education, intelligence, and mental state.”                            Id.

      In the present case, Mitchner challenges the voluntariness

of his first two statements to law enforcement, made at the gas

station      and    at    108       Gallatin       Street,       respectively.           At   the

hearing,      he      expressly        waived          any      argument        regarding     the

voluntariness of the statements he made to Agent Chau at the

police station.            (See Mot. to Suppress Hr’g Tr. 1-2.)                               With

respect to the two statements at issue, the facts elicited by

the     government         are        more        than       sufficient         to    establish

voluntariness.            Detectives’ interactions with Mitchner at the

gas station were brief and cordial.                             Mitchner’s statements at

                                                  18
Case 1:11-cr-00124-S-PAS Document 51 Filed 11/05/13 Page 19 of 19 PageID #: 201



108   Gallatin       Street    occurred    in    a   more     formal    environment.

Mitchner was handcuffed at the kitchen table.                   However, Mitchner

fails to allege that he was subject to any promises, threats, or

deprivations.         According      to   the   government,     he     was   calm   and

relaxed during all his interactions with the police.                         Finally,

he    was   advised     of     his   constitutional         rights     before   being

questioned.

      Next,    Mitchner        contends     that     his    statements       must   be

suppressed because they were obtained as a direct result of the

illegal     arrest    and     search.     This     argument    fails    because,    as

discussed above, both the search and the arrest complied with

the Fourth Amendment.

III. Conclusion

      For the foregoing reasons, Defendant’s Motion to Suppress

is DENIED.



IT IS SO ORDERED.
