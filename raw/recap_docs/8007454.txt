ense level was not adjusted to the starting point of level (30)
but instead at level (38).2

Petitioner was sentence to 144 months after the reduction of
minus 2 levels for minor role under USSG §3B1.l(b) and another 3
levels for acceptfjresponsibility under §3E:1 arriving at guideline
level 33 and a sentence between 135=168 monthsa

and the minus 5 levelsfof downward adjustment, then petitioner sent=
ence should have been at level 25 ,.hetween 57 and 71 months¢?
' 4. On or around Septa 2004, petitioner for the first time became
aware through other prisoners that a minor role adjustment guideline
level starts at level (30) for any drug offense involving over guidee
line level 30 due to drug quantityo _He was informed that such new law
became effective Nov. 01, 2002i After realizing that his sentence was
imposed after the law took effect, petitioner contacted his family to
review his plea agreement and his PSl to determine if such law -was
waived or even mention. Both the plea agreement and the PSI did not
discussed nor did petitioner waived the guideline amendment 640 for
"minor role participant; "On or around late Oct`or early NonYZOOA, pet“"
itioner contacted his sentencing attorney to request why he did
not benefit from such new law. Counsel informed petitioner that since

he pleaded quilty under rule ll(c), such amendment 640 was not applic-

Petitioner;deadai quilty to count (l) of the indictment charging a
a conspiracy to distribute herion_and cocaine. The indictment did not
specify drug quantity. The plea agreement reveals that petitioner st-
ipulated that his offense involved over 150 kilos of cocaine.

There's a possibility that there's an 10 year menimum.mandatory
sentence limitation based on the plea of over 5 kilos, however, the
indictment nor did the plea specify 21 USC §841(b)(1)(A) but instead
§846_and §841(a)(1), and obviously the indictment did not specify any'
drug quantityi Thus, leaving to the inescapable conclusion that petit-
ioner sentence falls under 5341(b)(l)(€) of from 0 thru 20 yrs w/o any
minimum mandatory'limitations. _
