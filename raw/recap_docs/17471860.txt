       The defendant appeared before the undersigned on February 4, 2011. He was

defendant is, DETAINED pending the detention hearing, see 18 U.S.C. ยง 3142 ("During a

continuance, the defendant shall be detained. . . ."); and (3) the U.S. Marshal lodge a detainer

against the defendant with the state authorities on the basis of this Order.
