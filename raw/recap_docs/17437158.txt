                         ORDER AFFIRMING THE
              RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE


     The United States Magistrate Judge filed with the Court on February 17, 2010 her

  Recommended Decision (Docket # 40).          The Defendant filed his objections to the

  Recommended Decision on March 8, 2010 (Docket # 43) and the Government filed its

  response to those objections on March 25, 2010 (Docket # 44). I have reviewed and

  considered the Magistrate Judge's Recommended Decision, together with the entire

  record; I have made a de novo determination of all matters adjudicated by the Magistrate

  Judge's Recommended Decision; and I concur with the recommendations of the United

  States Magistrate Judge for the reasons set forth in her Recommended Decision, and

  determine that no further proceeding is necessary.

         1.      It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the
                 Magistrate Judge is hereby AFFIRMED.

         2.      It is further ORDERED that the Defendantâ€™s Motion to Suppress
                 (Docket # 23) be and hereby is DENIED.


                                               /s/John A. Woodcock, Jr.
                                               JOHN A. WOODCOCK, JR.
                                               UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
