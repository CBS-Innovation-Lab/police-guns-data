                         MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
                          September 23, 2011

SARIS, D.J.
                           I.   INTRODUCTION

       Now pending before this Court is defendant Jamont F.

Dubose’s (“Dubose”) Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct

Sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (Docket No. 62), and the

Government’s Initial Request for Summary Dismissal (Docket No.

64).

A.     Relevant Procedural History

       On September 19, 2007, an Indictment was returned charging

Dubose with being a felon in possession of a firearm and

ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g).      During the

criminal proceedings, an evidentiary hearing was held on Dubose’s

motion to suppress evidence, and on March 31, 2008, this Court

denied the motion.    See Memorandum and Order (Docket No. 27).

       On June 10, 2008, Dubose entered a change of plea and pled

guilty.   On October 2, 2008, a sentencing hearing was held.     This

Court found the Armed Career Criminal Act (“ACCA”), 18 U.S.C.
§ 924(e)(1), applied to Dubose, and sentenced him to a term of

imprisonment of 180 months.    See Judgment (Docket No. 39).

Dubose filed a Notice of Appeal (Docket No. 40) on October 8,

2008.    Thereafter, an Amended Judgment (Docket No. 47) entered.

        On September 1, 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for

the First Circuit (“First Circuit”) affirmed this Court’s denial

of Dubose’s motion to suppress.    See Judgment (Docket No. 56);

Mandate (Docket No. 59, entered Oct. 20, 2009)(denying petition

for rehearing and petition for rehearing en banc); United States

v. Dubose, No. 08-2382 (1st Cir. 2009).     On November 1, 2010,

Dubose’s petition for writ of certiorari to the United States

Supreme Court was denied.    See DuBose v. United States, 131 S.Ct.

536 (2010)(No. 10-6629).

        On April 25, 2011, Dubose filed a pleading entitled

“Affidavit to Vacate A.C.C.A. Enhancement” (Docket No. 60).    In

that pleading, Dubose requested this Court consider his motion

for relief from his enhanced sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.

§ 3582.    He alleged that his ACCA sentence was imposed in error

because one of the predicate offenses, a Massachusetts assault

and battery on a police officer (“ABPO”) was based, improperly,

on a plea colloquy from this prior conviction.1    He maintained


1
 Dubose argued that the plea colloquy was concurrent with another
criminal case, involving a misdemeanor for simple assault, and

                                   2
that the Government had not met its initial burden of proving the

predicate conviction.   In addition, Dubose argued that this Court

erred in concluding that every ABPO qualified as a “violent

felony” under the ACCA.

     On May 13, 2011, this Court issued a Memorandum and Order

(Docket No. 61) construing Dubose’s “Affidavit to Vacate

A.C.C.A. Enhancement” (Docket No. 60) as a motion to

modify the judgment of conviction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582.

This Court denied the motion because none of Dubose’s arguments

fell within the three narrow exceptions for modification set

forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c).2    See United States v. Dubose, 2011

WL 1842825, *2 (D. Mass. 2011).

B.   The Section 2255 Motion

     After the denial of the § 3582 motion, on July 15, 2011,

Dubose filed the instant § 2255 motion, along with an

incorporated Memorandum in support (Docket No. 62).    This Court

directed service of the motion and a response by the respondent.

See Service Order (Docket No. 64).




thus was not a basis for application of the ACCA.

2
 This Court also noted that there was a fundamental problem with
Dubose’s claims because a review of the Presentence Report did
not reveal any predicate offenses of Assault and Battery on a
Police Officer, as Dubose argued.

                                  3
     In Dubose’s § 2255 motion, he seeks relief from his

conviction and/or sentence, either by dismissal of the

Indictment, or the grant of a new trial.    He raises four grounds

in support, although he discusses two of these grounds together

as Ground Two.    Additionally, he raises other grounds in the

Memorandum in Support that are not contained in the § 2255 motion

itself.   These grounds, considered together, are as follows.

     1.      Challenges to Prior Convictions Used for ACCA
             Enhancement

             A.   The Assault and Battery Offense

     First, Dubose contends that his Massachusetts Assault and

Battery plea colloquy from the conviction (Docket No. 0607-cr-

0758) did not categorically qualify as a “violent felony” under

the ACCA.3    He claims that he never pled to facts constituting a


3
 The criminal history record summary of this state case is set
forth in the Presentence Report (“PSR”), ¶ 40. On April 27,
2006, Dubose was charged in the Dorchester District Court with
Assault and Battery, and was convicted. He was sentenced on
August 16, 2006 to 18 months probation. On February 23, 2007, he
was detained for a violation of probation due to a new arrest.
On March 1, 2007, he was found to be violation of probation and
received 2.5 years in the House of Correction, 18 months
committed, with the balance suspended and probation to March 1,
2009, with credit for 13 days. On June 13, 2008 he was released
and transferred into federal custody. As background, the PSR,
¶ 40 states:

     Court records reflect that the defendant was
     represented by counsel. The complaint alleges that the
     defendant “did assault and beat” a female victim. The
     offense occurred on 1/28/06 in Dorchester, MA. A

                                   4
violent felony, and that, despite the charging instrument’s use

of the phrase “did assault and beat,” he did not commit a crime

of violence.   He also argues that the Massachusetts assault and

battery statute covers offenses that are both violent and non-

violent (including those that are nothing more than an offensive

touching).   See Section 2255 Motion (Docket No. 62 at 4, ¶ 12).

Finally, in his Memorandum in support, Dubose claims that his

plea was to a simple assault, and constituted a misdemeanor

because he received a sentence of 18 months probation (i.e., a

term of imprisonment of 100 days or less).   See Section 2255

Motion (Docket No. 62-3 at 2).   Therefore, he contends, this

conviction may not be deemed to be a “violent felony” under the




      warrant issued, and the defendant was arrested on
      4/7/06.

      Information from the Boston Police Department reflects
      that on 1/28/06 at 3:45 p.m., officers responded to a
      domestic violence call. The victim indicated that she
      had an argument with her boyfriend, the defendant, over
      use of her checking account. According to the victim,
      when she refused to let the defendant use her account,
      he punched her in the face. Officers observed the
      victim to have a swollen lip with blood on it. The
      victim refused medical attention and was advised to
      seek a restraining order.

      The Probation Office has attempted, but not yet had the
      opportunity, to speak with the defendant’s probation
      officer.

ACCA.

             B.   The December 1, 2003 Resisting Arrest Offense

        Dubose also presents a separate challenge to the use of

another state conviction as a prior violent felony conviction

under the ACCA.    He claims that his Resisting Arrest charge out

of the Dorchester District Court (Docket No. 0307-7480H), for

which he received six months in the House of Correction on June

22, 2004, was not a “crime of violence.”    Id. at 2.4


4
 The criminal history record summary of this state case is set
forth in the PSR, ¶ 39. On December 1, 2003, Dubose was charged
in the Dorchester District Court with Resisting Arrest, and was
convicted. On June 22, 2004, he received a sentence of six
months in the House of Correction, committed, concurrent with
Docket No. 03-7001. He was also charged with various other
offenses, including traffic and motor vehicle offenses. The PSR,
¶ 39 states:

        Court records reflect that the defendant was
        represented by counsel. On Count A, the defendant was
        originally charged with Possession to Distribute a
        Class D Drug. On Count E, the defendant was originally
        charged with Malicious Destruction of Property Over
        $250. Both charges were amended prior to disposition.
        The offense occurred and the defendant was arrested on
        11/29/03 in Dorchester, MA.

        Information from the Boston Police Department reflects
        that on 11/29/03 at 5:20 a.m., officers on patrol
        observed a vehicle with an attached plate. Officers
        followed the vehicle and it took off at a high rate of
        speed. The defendant, who was operating the vehicle,
        drove into a school parking lot and jumped out of the
        vehicle while it was moving, causing the vehicle to
        crash into a fence on school property. The defendant
        fled from officers on foot and dropped a jacket that he
        was wearing along the way. The defendant eventually

                                   6
           C.   The November 10, 2003 Drug Offense and the
                Resisting Arrest Offense

      Next, Dubose contends that his prior state convictions

arising out of Massachusetts District Court cases do not amount

to felonies; rather, they are misdemeanor offenses only.     Dubose

argues in his Memorandum in Support that the state district

courts do not have jurisdiction to sentence prisoners to a state

prison.   Since he was tried in the district court, -- and not the

state superior court -- he contends that his offenses may not be

considered as felonies.   Thus, he asserts that his drug offenses

(Docket No. 0307-cr-7001D), which ran concurrent with other

charges, cannot be used to enhance his sentence under the ACCA.5

Dubose does not address specifically the concurrent Resisting




      stopped running and was arrested. Officers found six
      plastic bags of marijuana in his jacket pockets, along
      with a cell phone, and $150 in cash. The defendant’s
      motor vehicle registration had been revoked and the
      defendant acknowledged that he did not have a license.

 The criminal history record summary of this state case is set
forth in the PSR, ¶ 38. On November 10, 2003, Dubose was charged
in the Dorchester District Court with Drug Violations Near a
School/Park, Resisting Arrest, other drug offenses. On June 22,
2004, he received a sentence of two years in the House of
Correction, committed, concurrent with Docket No. 03-7480 and 99-
10481-01.

Arrest charge (Docket No. 0307-cr-7001E).6

 With respect to the underlying factual background, the PSR, ¶ 38
states:

     Court records reflect that the defendant was
     represented by counsel. The offense occurred and the
     defendant was arrested on 11/7/03 in Dorchester, MA.

     Information from the Boston Police Department reflects
     that on 11/7/03 at 7:20 p.m., members of the drug unit
     observed a man making calls, counting currency, and
     waiting in front of a Dunkin’ Donuts near Bailey Street
     and Dorchester Avenue. Officers observed the defendant
     pull up in a vehicle, exit the vehicle, take money from
     the man who had been waiting, and give the man a small
     object. Believing that a drug transaction had
     occurred, officers stopped the man on the street, who
     admitted to swallowing two $30 bags of drugs that he
     had just purchased from the defendant. Other officers
     followed the defendant’s vehicle and stopped him. As
     they approached the defendant, they saw him putting an
     object in his mouth and swallowing it. The defendant
     pushed away from officers and fled, leading officers on
     a pursuit. Officers caught the defendant, and he
     struggled while they were placing him under arrest.
     They noticed him gagging and then observed him spit out
     three plastic bags containing what was believed to be
     cocaine. Several officers were treated for injuries.
     Upon arrest, the defendant was found in possession of
     two plastic bags of marijuana, $536 in cash, and a cell
     phone.

Id. Dubose was convicted of the Resisting Arrest offense (Docket
No. 0307-cr-7001E) and sentenced to six months in the House of
Correction, concurrent with Count D (the drug violation charge).
The Addendum to the PSR reflects that defense counsel made
Objections to ¶¶ 37-40, and also contested the application of the
ACCA. The Probation Officer responded to these Objections and
made no revisions.

                                8
     2.   Challenges Based on Ineffective Assistance of Counsel
          and District Court Error in Relying on the PSR

     Second, Dubose asserts an ineffective assistance of counsel

claim against his defense counsel, Attorney Daniel J. Cloherty,

both as trial counsel and as appellate counsel.7   He claims that

counsel failed to object to the plea colloquy with respect to the

assertion that the ACCA applied to Dubose.   Id. at 5.8   He also

asserts counsel failed to investigate his version of the facts

and/or failed to investigate properly his past criminal history

or present evidence about this, and failed to object to the PSR

conclusion that he falls under the ACCA.

     In the same paragraph, Dubose asserts a third ground for

relief -- that this Court improperly relied on the U.S. Probation




7
 Although Dubose’s Motion itself contains claims of ineffective
assistance of counsel and District Court error in finding him
eligible for ACCA enhancement under Ground Two, his attached
Memorandum in support intermingles these claims as part of his
Ground One and Ground Two. See Section 2255 Motion (Docket No.
62-2 at 1).

8
 In his Memorandum in Support, Dubose contends that Attorney
Cloherty allowed him to be misled in court, and made him believe
he was eligible for an ACCA enhancement. As a result, he
accepted a plea bargain which included an ACCA enhancement.
Additionally, Dubose contends that during the appeal process,
Attorney Cloherty failed to raise “very substantial, serious
issues” that he wanted him to raise, and thus the outcome of the
decision would have been different. Dubose does not state what
those issues were, or how or why the outcome would have been
different. See Section 2255 Motion (Docket No. 62-4 at 1).

                                9
Office’s “misinformation” in the PSR with respect to the charging

documents, in order to find Dubose eligible for an enhancement

under the ACCA.   He asserts the PSR mischaracterized his past

criminal history and offense conduct, leading this Court to find

prior convictions constituted “violent felonies.”   He further

claims this Court failed to review properly his criminal record

de novo.   Section 2255 Motion (Docket No. 62 at 5).

     3.    Challenges to the Conviction Based on Police Officers’
           Alleged Violations of Law

     Dubose’s fourth ground for relief challenges the validity of

his conviction rather than his enhanced sentence.   He contends

that his constitutional rights were violated when the Police

Officers concluded they had a reasonable suspicion to stop him as

they observed him approach and lean into a car in the mid-

afternoon in a neighborhood that was not a high crime area.9


9
 This Court outlined the underlying factual background in the
Memorandum and Order denying Dubose’s Motion to Suppress. To
reiterate for completeness, the relevant background is as
follows:

     On February 22, 2007 at about 2:30 p.m., Boston Police
     Officers Emanuel Canuto and Matthew Ryan were in plain
     clothes in an unmarked car, driving on a routine patrol
     on Washington Street, headed toward Fuller Street, in
     Dorchester. They were driving 15-20 m.p.h. The area
     that they were patrolling is primarily residential, but
     also includes several small shops. Although a shooting
     had occurred about four months earlier in this general
     area, it was not a so-called “hot spot” with a
     recent unusually active pattern of crime. The officers

                                10
observed a Toyota Camry with two male occupants driving
on Fairmount Street towards its intersection with
Washington Street. The Camry double-parked on
Fairmount, approximately two to three car lengths from
the intersection. At the same time, the officers saw a
male, later identified as Defendant Jamont DuBose,
walking on Washington Street and then turning onto
Fairmount Street, heading directly for the Camry.
After Defendant reached the Camry, the officers saw him
lean into the car through the window of the driver’s
side door; Defendant’s body from the waist up and both
of his hands were inside the car. He then walked away
from the car. The whole encounter was brief. The
officers could not see what he was doing inside the
car.

Suspecting they had witnessed a drug transaction, the
officers immediately turned around at the intersection
of Washington and Fuller Streets and saw the Camry take
a left on Washington Street, heading towards Fuller
Street. They also saw Defendant backtrack, returning
in the same direction on Fairmount Street to the
intersection, and then taking a left on Washington
Street towards Fuller Street. The police officers
believed this was a pre-arranged meeting. The officers
then parked at an angle on the wrong side of Washington
Street and exited the car in order to talk to
Defendant. Both officers had badges displayed
prominently around their necks. At that time,
Defendant was walking away from the officers with his
back to them. Officer Canuto asked Defendant, who was
approximately ten feet away, “Excuse me, sir, can I
talk to you for a second?” Officer Canuto did not yell
at Defendant, but spoke loudly enough to ensure that he
would be heard. Defendant continued walking away and
kept his right hand inside the pocket of his hoodie.
Speaking more loudly, Officer Canuto asked Defendant at
least one or two additional times to turn around and
speak with him. Officer Canuto believed, correctly,
that Defendant heard him and ignored him the first
couple of times that Officer Canuto spoke to him.
Finally complying with Officer Canuto’s order,
Defendant turned around, keeping his right hand in his

                          11
     hoodie pocket. At this time, Officer Ryan was speaking
     to some teenage males who were standing nearby, in
     front of a pizza shop, and who had asked him why the
     police were stopping. Officer Ryan was not with
     Officer Canuto when Defendant finally stopped and
     turned to Officer Canuto. Officer Canuto feared that
     Defendant was carrying a gun and told him to remove his
     hand from his pocket. Defendant refused to comply.
     Officer Canuto repeated the order several more times
     and Defendant eventually complied. Fearing for his own
     safety, Officer Canuto performed a pat-frisk of
     Defendant’s pocket. In this pocket, Officer Canuto
     felt a hard object he believed to be consistent with a
     firearm. Officer Canuto touched the item through
     Defendant’s hoodie and asked, “What is this?” Defendant
     responded, “That’s not mine.” Officer Canuto reached
     into the pocket and pulled out a silver .22 caliber
     Imperial revolver. After Officer Canuto alerted
     Officer Ryan that he had retrieved a gun, Defendant ran
     towards Croftland Avenue. After a brief foot chase,
     which ended in front of 882 Washington Street,
     Defendant was caught and placed in handcuffs. As he
     was being placed under arrest, Defendant spontaneously
     stated, “I just found it and picked it up.” After
     arresting Defendant, the officers saw the same black
     Camry that they had observed approximately five minutes
     earlier. They performed a traffic stop. A Field
     Interrogation and Observation was conducted of both the
     driver and passenger; they were both released after
     they were pat-frisked and the car was searched. Both
     claimed that they did not know Defendant. The gun was
     loaded with seven rounds of ammunition.

Memorandum and Order (Docket No. 27) at 1-5. This Court found
that when Dubose was seized by Officer Canuto, who was
prominently wearing his badge, and told Dubose to remove his
hands from his pocket, at that point, a reasonable person would
believe that he was not free to ignore the police order and leave
the scene. Id. at 6. This Court further found that Officer
Canuto was entitled to frisk Dubose for his own safety. Id. at
7.



                               12
The next allegation concerning the Officers’ conduct regarding a

pat frisk of Dubose after the stop is not set forth clearly;

however, it appears he also contends that the Officers did not

have reasonable suspicion to pat frisk him because Dubose had

complied with the order to remove his hands from his pocket.10

In his Memorandum in Support, Dubose contends that the Police

Officers did not observe any kind of interaction, exchange, or

involvement of Dubose with the occupants of the motor vehicle,

that the occupants were not known to them, and that there were no

reports of any criminal activity involving him, the vehicle, or

the area.11   He further contends that the Police Officers




10
 In his Memorandum in Support, Dubose also interposes other
issues related to the Police Officers’ conduct as well as their
knowledge at the time of the incident (e.g., whether the Camry
and the individuals were known to the Officers, whether there had
been any report of criminal activity in the area, whether
anything had occurred after he leaned into the car that would
support a reasonable suspicion that a crime had occurred, whether
the Officers conduct involved a “Clandestine Meeting,” [between
him and the occupants of the vehicle], whether the Officers
observed an interaction involving Dubose and other passengers in
the vehicle, whether he had been given his Miranda rights, etc.).
See Section 2255 Motion (Docket No. 62-2 at 1-2).

11
 Dubose attaches to his motion excerpts of the Evidentiary
Hearing on the Motion to Suppress, along with the Boston Police
Report regarding his arrest on February 22, 2007. See Section

                                 13
harassed and intimidated him by following him in their vehicle,

and then, later, grabbing him by the elbow and demanding he take

his hands out of his pockets, and barring him from leaving.

After Dubose fled the scene and was caught a half a block away

after a foot chase, he was questioned and placed in the back of

the police cruiser.   Dubose claims that while being held in the

cruiser, he was never given his Miranda rights.

       In the body of the Memorandum in Support of his § 2255

petition, Dubose seeks appointment of counsel.

C.     The Government’s Response and Motion for Summary Dismissal

       On July 21, 2011, the Government responded to the § 2255

petition by seeking summary dismissal.   See Response (Docket No.

64).   As grounds for dismissal, the Government contends that: (1)

Dubose seeks to relitigate issues previously raised and decided

against him both in this Court and on direct appeal;12(2)

Dubose’s assertions are contradicted by the PSR, as well by

recent decisions of the First Circuit in United States v.



2255 Motion (Docket No. 62-8).

12
 The Government cites to, inter alia, United States v. Butt, 731
F.2d 75, 76 n. 1 (1st Cir. 1984)(“It is settled that a § 2255
motion may not revive issues previously determined on direct
appeal”); United States v. Moran, 107 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.
1997)(same); and Singleton v. United States, 26 F.3d 233, 240
(1st Cir. 1993).


                                 14
Holloway, 630 F.3d 252, 252 (1st Cir. Jan. 21, 2011) and United

States v. Dancy, 640 F.3d 455 (1st Cir. Apr. 13, 2011);(3) even

if Holloway applied in this case (to exclude the Assault and

Battery offense from ACCA consideration), Dubose would still be

considered an Armed Career Criminal because he has three other

ACC predicate offenses; and (4) knowing the problems with his

criminal record, Dubose has attempted to transform his ACC claim

into one involving ineffective assistance of counsel, but he has

failed to provide any information as to what any investigation by

defense counsel would have uncovered, or how any investigation or

objections would have impacted his ACC status.

     On August 1, 2011, Dubose filed a Response to the

Government’s request for summary dismissal (Docket No. 65).

Virtually all but one of his arguments in the Response reiterate

the claims in his original § 2255 motion and memorandum in

support.13   He raises a new argument, i.e., that the Resisting


13
 The repeated arguments in the Response are as follows. Dubose
again argues that three prior convictions (i.e., Resisting Arrest
(No. 0307-CR-7480H), Assault and Battery (No. 0607-CR-0758), and
Possession of Class B with intent to distribute (No. 0307-CR-
7001D)) cannot constitute predicate convictions under the ACCA.
He also contends that, with respect to the drug offense, “[t]he
District Court may not impose a sentence to a state prison”
(reiterating the claim that his offense was a misdemeanor and not
a felony because it was imposed by the state district court and
not the superior court). Response (Docket No. 64 at 2). Next,
Dubose reasserts his ineffective assistance of counsel claims,
arguing that his defense counsel failed to investigate the facts

                                 15
Arrest and the Assault and Battery offenses are “crimes of

violence” under the Career Offender Guidelines, but cannot be

considered for purposes of the ACCA, which provides for “violent

felonies.”     He maintains that the definitions for “crimes of

violence” and “violent felonies” are similar, but not identical.

He does not expound on the impact any differences would have in

this case.14


and criminal history; failed to file objections to the
Presentence Report which certified his ACCA status; “failed to
investigate the P.S.I.R. and sentencing proceeding and
violations,” id.; and “[f]ailed to raise any serious issues that
was very important for the outcome of the decision.” Id.
Further, Dubose contends that his counsel failed to object to the
plea colloquy that charged him with being an Armed Career
Criminal. Finally, Dubose contends that this Court improperly
relied on the Probation Office’s misinformation on charging
documents to find him eligible for an ACCA enhancement. He
contends that this Court failed to review properly the predicate
offenses before deeming them to constitute violent felonies.

14
 Without the need to address this issue in detail, this Court
rejects Dubose’s argument. The First Circuit in Holloway has
stated that “[t]he terms ‘crime of violence’ and ‘violent felony’
are nearly identical in meaning. Because of this, ‘decisions
construing one term inform the construction of the other.’”
Holloway, 630 F.3d at 254 n.1 citing United States v. Willings,
588 F.3d 56, 58 n. 2 (1st Cir. 2009). See Miller v. United
States, 2011 WL 2422845 (D. Mass. June 16, 2011 (same). See also
United States v. Almenas, 553 F.3d 27, 34 n.7 (1st Cir. 2009)
(stating that: “Even though the Court in Begay [v. United States,
553 U.S. 137 (2008)] was interpreting the violent felony
definition of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C.
§ 924(e)(2)(B), and though much of its analysis appeared specific
to that statute, ‘for both prudential and precedential reasons,
we have read that statute and the almost parallel guideline
language at issue [in the guidelines definition of crime of
violence] as being in pari passu.’ [United States v.] Williams,

                           II.   DISCUSSION

A.   The Request For Appointment of Counsel

     Although this Court has previously stated the issues raised

by Dubose are complex, appointment of counsel under 18 U.S.C.

§ 3006A is not in the interests of justice in light of the lack

of merit of his § 2255 motion, as discussed below.

     Accordingly, this Court DENIES Dubose’s request for counsel,

contained in the body of his § 2255 motion.

B.   Standard of Review

     1.     Review of Section 2255 Motions

     Section 2255 of Title 28 provides that “[a] prisoner in

custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress

claiming the right to be released ... may move the court which

imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the

sentence.   28 U.S.C. § 2255(a).    “[T]he statute provides for

post-conviction relief in four instances, namely, if the



529 F.3d [1] at 6 [1st Cir. 2008].”)[brackets added]. In other
words, the terms are interchangeable. See United States v.
Glover, 558 F.3d 71, n.3 (1st Cir. 2009)(“The Guidelines'
definition of “crime of violence” closely tracks the definition
of “violent felony” in the Armed Career Criminal Act (“ACCA”), 18
U.S.C. § 924(e), and the residual clauses in each are identically
worded. We have considered these residual clauses to be
relatively interchangeable, and have treated interpretations of
one as persuasive authority relative to the other.”).




                                   17
petitioner’s sentence (1) was imposed in violation of the

Constitution, or (2) was imposed by a court that lacked

jurisdiction, or (3) exceeded the statutory maximum, or (4) was

otherwise subject to collateral attack.”   David v. United States,

134 F.3d 470, 474 (1st Cir. 1998)(citing Hill v. United States,

368 U.S. 424, 426-427 (1962)).

     The defendant bears the burden of establishing the need for

relief under § 2255.   David, 134 F.3d at 474.   See Mack v. United

States, 635 F.2d 20, 26-27 (1st Cir. 1980).   In order to obtain

collateral relief, a petitioner “must clear a significantly

higher hurdle than would exist on direct appeal.”   United States

v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 166 (1982).15   Indeed, there is a

presumption of finality of criminal convictions once all direct

appeals have been completed.   Singleton v. United States, 26 F.3d

233, 236 (1st Cir. 1994) (citing Brecht v Abrahamson, 507 U.S.



15
 The Supreme Court in Frady rejected the plain error standard of
review, stating: “We believe the proper standard for review of
[petitioner’s § 2255] motion is the ‘cause and actual prejudice’
standard enunciated in Davis v. United States, 411 U.S. 233, 93
S.Ct. 1577, 36 L.Ed.2d 216 (1973), and later confirmed and
extended in Francis v. Henderson, 425 U.S. 536, 96 S.Ct. 1708, 48
L.Ed.2d 149 (1976), and Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 97
S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977). Under this standard, to
obtain collateral relief based on trial errors to which no
contemporaneous objection was made, a convicted defendant must
show both (1) ‘cause’ excusing his double procedural default, and
(2) ‘actual prejudice’ resulting from the errors of which he
complains.” Frady, 456 U.S. at 167-68.

                                 18
619 (1993) and Frady, 456 U.S. at 164-65).   “Postconviction

relief on collateral review is an extraordinary remedy, available

only on a sufficient showing of fundamental unfairness.”

Singleton, 26 F.3d at 236.

     Additionally, issues disposed of on direct appeal may not be

reviewed in a subsequent § 2255 proceeding absent an intervening

change in the law or a showing that manifest injustice would

otherwise result.   See United States v. Conley, 323 F.3d 7, 22

(1st Cir. 2003)(“Claims that previously have been addressed on

direct review, however, may not be readjudicated collaterally

under § 2255 absent equitable considerations, such as actual

innocence or cause or prejudice.”); United States v. Michaud, 901

F.2d 5, 6 (1st Cir. 1990)(“We note that certain other claims

raised in the § 2255 motion were decided on direct appeal and may

not be relitigated under a different label on collateral

review.”; citing Tracey v. United States, 739 F.2d 679, 682 (1st

Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1109 (1985) and Robson v.

United States, 526 F.2d 1145, 1147 (1st Cir. 1975)).    See also

United States v. Butt, 731 F.2d 75, 77 n.1 (1st Cir. 1984)(“It is

settled that a § 2255 motion may not revive issues previously

determined on direct appeal, Dirring v. United States, 370 F.2d

862, 864 (1st Cir. 1967)”).

     Unless the petitioner claims a jurisdictional or

                                19
constitutional violation, a § 2255 claim will not be considered

cognizable unless “the alleged error presents a ‘fundamental

defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of

justice,’ or ‘an omission inconsistent with rudimentary demands

of fair procedure.’”   Cofske v. United States, 290 F.3d 437, 441

(1st Cir. 2002)(citing Hill, 368 U.S. at 428).

     2.   Review of Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claims

     With respect to the standard for § 2255 claims raised under

the Sixth Amendment16 alleging ineffective assistance of counsel,

a petitioner must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that

“(1) counsel’s performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient

performance prejudiced the defense.”   Bucuvalas v. United States,

98 F.3d 652, 658 (1st Cir. 1996) (citing Strickland v.

Washington, 466 U.S. at 687).   See Peralta v. United States, 597

F.3d 74, 79 (1st Cir. 2010)(“To succeed on a claim of ineffective

assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment, [petitioner]

must show both deficient performance by counsel and resulting

prejudice.”).



16
 The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution states
that: “[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy
the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense.”
U.S. Const. amend. VI. A defendant is not merely entitled to the
assistance of counsel, but the effective assistance of counsel.
Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 686 (1984)(citing McMann
v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 774 n.14 (1970)).

                                20
     The first prong of the Strickland test is satisfied where

counsel’s performance is “so inferior as to be objectively

unreasonable.”   United States v. McGill, 11 F.3d 223, 226 (1st

Cir. 1993).   An attorney’s conduct will be reasonable if it is

found to fall “within the range of competence expected of

attorneys in criminal cases.”   United States v. Bosch, 584 F.2d

1113, 1121 (1st Cir. 1978)(citations omitted).   Moreover, courts

have stressed that “effective representation” is not synonymous

with “errorless representation;” the courts’ review of counsel’s

performance must be deferential, and reasonableness must be

considered in light of “prevailing professional norms.”    Peralta,

597 F.3d at 79 (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688).   The

prejudice prong of the test requires that Dubose show “a

reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional

errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.”

Smiley v. Maloney, 422 F.3d 17, 20 (1st Cir. 2005)(citing

Strickland, 446 U.S. at 694).

     3.   Review of Prior Convictions Under the ACCA

     Section 924(e)(1) of the ACCA provides:

     In the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of
     this title and has three previous convictions by any
     court referred to in section 922(g)(1) of this title
     for a violent felony or serious drug offense, or both,
     committed on occasions different from one another, such
     person shall be fined under this title and imprisoned
     not less than fifteen years, and, notwithstanding any

                                21
     other provision of law, the court shall not suspend the
     sentence of, or grant a probationary sentence to, such
     person with respect to the conviction under section
     922(g).

18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1).

     ACCA predicate offenses include certain drug offenses and

“violent felonies.”   Under section 924(e)(2)(B)(i) and (ii):

     [T]he term ‘violent felony” means any crime punishable
     by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that
     --

     (i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or
     threatened use of physical force against the person of
     another; or

     (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of
     explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents
     a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.

18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(i) and (ii).   See United States v.

Dancy, 640 F.3d 455, 464-65 (1st Cir. 2011).

     In the ACCA sentencing statute, “[c]lause (i) is sometimes

referred to as the ‘force clause.’   The portion of clause (ii)

following the enumerated offenses is known as the ‘residual

clause.’” Id. at 465 (quoting Holloway, 630 F.3d at 256; other

citations omitted).   See United States v. Oliveira, 2011 WL

2909816, *4-5 (D. Mass. July 21, 2011)(outlining history of the

ACCA, application of the residual clause of the ACCA, and noting

troubling matters concerning application of the ACCA).

     The Supreme Court has employed a “categorical approach” in



                                22
determining whether an offense is a violent felony.   Under this

approach:

     “[courts] look only to the fact of conviction and the
     statutory definition of the prior offense, and do not
     generally consider the particular facts disclosed by
     the record of conviction. That is, we consider whether
     the elements of the offense are of the type that would
     justify its inclusion within the residual provision,
     without inquiring into the specific conduct of this
     particular offender." James [v. United States], 550
     U.S. [192], at 202 [127 S.Ct. 1586] (internal quotation
     marks and citations omitted); see also Taylor v. United
     States, 495 U.S. 575, 599–602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109
     L.Ed.2d 607 (1990).

Sykes v. United States, 131 S.Ct. 2267 (June 9, 2011).

     “Only where the crime includes a range of conduct, some of

which falls outside the ACCA’s definition, may the court ‘peek

under the coverlet’ to determine what offense was at issue in the

underlying conviction.”   Oliveira, 2011 WL 2909816 at *7 citing

United States v. Gautier, 590 F. Supp. 2d 214 at 222 (for ACCA

purposes in determining an offense to be a violent felony, the

sentencing judge court could not look to underlying police

reports or complaint applications not adopted by the defendant as

part of the plea or colloquy; the court may look only to the jury

instructions, charging document, plea agreement, the transcript

of the plea colloquy, or any facts confirmed by the defendant at

sentencing and any comparable judicial record) and citing

Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 16 (2005)(other citations



                                23
omitted).   “Where the defendant is convicted under a statute that

encompasses both violent and non-violent offenses (as in assault

and battery), and the government has failed to show under Shepard

that the defendant was convicted of the more violent offense, the

court applies the categorical approach to the non-violent

offense.”   Oliveira, 2011 WL 2909816, at *7.

     With these standards in mind, the Court turns to Dubose’s

claims, starting with the claim that his Assault and Battery

offense does not qualify as a predicate violent felony offense

under the ACCA.

C.   The Assault and Battery Charge

     This Court finds that Dubose is correct when he asserts that

his 2006 Assault and Battery conviction (see PSR, ¶ 40), may not

be used as a predicate office under the ACCA, because the

Government has not shown that this offense was a “violent felony”

under the ACCA, in light of recent First Circuit case law, see

Holloway, supra; the fact that the charging instrument against

Dubose contained the language “did assault and beat” is not

sufficient to constitute a “violent felony” for ACCA purposes.

     To expound further, the First Circuit in Holloway revisited

and rejected its prior holding in United States v. Mangos, 134

F.3d 460, 464 (1st Cir. 1998) and ruled that Mangos was no longer

good law, because the boilerplate language “did assault and beat”

                                24
in the charging instrument, standing alone, did not establish a

violent felony.   Holloway, 630 F.3d at 255-56.   The Holloway

Court required further analysis before district courts could

conclude whether a simple Assault and Battery qualified under the

ACCA; this analysis normally would involve looking to certain

documents, and consideration whether the conduct described in

those documents fell within the force clause or the residual

clause of the ACCA.

     Here, the Government does not strenuously object to Dubose’s

argument in this regard.   Thus, applying Holloway, and without

additional Shepard-approved evidence, this Court will not

consider the Assault and Battery offense as a predicate offense

under the ACCA.

     Nevertheless, even if this Court were to discount the

Assault and Battery charge in ¶ 40 of the PSR, Dubose still has

at least three predicate offenses rendering the ACCA applicable,

as discussed below.

D.   The Armed Robbery Offense Constitutes a Predicate Offense
     For ACCA Purposes

     The parties do not dispute that the Armed Robbery offense

contained in the PSR, ¶ 37, falls within the ACCA definition of a




                                25
violent felony.17

     Accordingly, this Court finds this conviction to constitute

the a predicate conviction for ACCA purposes.

E.   The Resisting Arrest Offenses Constitute Two Prior Felony
     Convictions For ACCA Purposes

     Dubose’s criminal history reflects two separate offenses for

Resisting Arrest.   See PSR ¶¶ 38 and 39.18


17
 The PSR, ¶ 37, also notes that Dubose was convicted of Armed
Assault with Intent to Rob, and Assault and Battery with a
Dangerous Weapon. These would also qualify as predicate offenses
under the ACCA, but are treated together as one predicate
offense.

18
 Dubose does not suggest that the Resisting Arrest charge in the
PSR, ¶ 39 (Docket No. 0307-CR 7480H), and the Resisting Arrest
charge in the PSR, ¶ 38 (Docket No. 0307-cr-7001E), should not be
treated as separate charges pursuant to Amendment 709 to the
Sentencing Guidelines in order to undermine the enhancement of
his sentence under the ACCA. Amendment 709 was proposed in May
2007, and became effective on November 1, 2007. It restated the
rules for determining when multiple crimes are to be counted as
one for criminal history calculation purposes. U.S. SENTENCING
GUIDELINES § 4A1.2(a)(2)(2009)(as amended by Supp. to App. C.,
Amend. 709 (2009)). Amendment 709 provides:

     Prior sentences are counted separately if the sentences
     were imposed for offenses that were separated by an
     intervening arrest. If there is no intervening arrest,
     prior sentences are counted separately unless (A) the
     sentences resulted from offenses contained in the same
     charging instrument; or (B) the sentences were imposed
     on the same day.

Id. In this case, the first arrest occurred on November 7, 2003,
and Dubose was charged on November 10, 2003. There was an
intervening arrest (on November 29, 2003); Dubose was charged on
December 1, 2003. Thus, notwithstanding that Dubose was
sentenced on both Resisting Arrest charges on the same day (June

                                26
     Dubose’s argument -- that the offenses arising out the

Massachusetts District Court (rather than the Superior Court)

constitute “misdemeanors” and not “felonies”, and therefore

cannot be used as predicate offenses -- is misplaced, as is his

argument that the sentence must be to a “state prison” rather

than a house of correction.    The First Circuit has made clear

that a Resisting Arrest conviction under Massachusetts law is a

prior felony conviction, because, under Massachusetts law, it

carries a punishment of up to two and one-half years in jail or

the house of correction.19    See United States v. Almenas, 553

F.3d 27, 31-32 (1st Cir. 2009] citing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 268,

§ 32B.   Almenas also stated that:

     Neither the fact that Massachusetts law categorizes
     resisting arrest as a misdemeanor, nor the fact that
     [defendant] was not actually imprisoned for a term
     exceeding one year, affects our analysis. A crime
     ‘punishable’ by imprisonment for a term exceeding one



22, 2004), Amendment 709 provides that each conviction shall be
counted separately.

19
 The ACCA provides that “any State offenses classified by the
laws of the State as a misdemeanor and punishable by a term of
imprisonment of two years or less” are not “crime[s] punishable
by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.” Dancy, 640 F.3d
at 465 n.6; 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(20). Resisting Arrest offenses
under Massachusetts law do not fall within this provision,
because the punishment is by imprisonment in a jail or house of
correction for not more than two and one-half years (not two
years or less). Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 268, § 32B.


                                  27
     year is a felony for purposes of the career offender
     provision, ‘regardless of whether such offense is
     specifically designated as a felony and regardless of
     the actual sentence imposed.’

Id. at 32 citing U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2, cmt. n.1.

     Finally, Almenas discussed the elements of the crime, and,

taking a categorical approach, stated that Resisting Arrest under

Massachusetts law is typically a crime of violence.   Almenas, 553

F.3d at 31-35; 35 n.9 (noting that the enumerated crimes

“typically” involves purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct,

and stating that “if a defendant’s flight from arrest is to

qualify as resisting arrest under Massachusetts law, it must

either involve the use or threatened use of force or create a

substantial risk of injury to a police officer or another.”).

     The Almenas holding was recently expanded on by the First

Circuit in Dancy, addressing the question whether a defendant’s

Massachusetts conviction for assault and battery on a police

office qualified as a violent felony in order to serve as a

predicate offense under the ACCA.   The First Circuit stated in

Dancy that:

     As we have said of the Massachusetts crime of resisting
     arrest, the crime involves “resisting the authority of
     a police officer, an official charged with defending
     the public.” [United States v.] Almenas, 553 F.3d [27]
     at 34 [1st Cir. 2009]. Resisting arrest poses an
     arguably greater risk than the enumerated offenses
     because the officer is “duty-bound to effectuate the
     arrest,” resulting in “a significant risk of conflict

                               28
     and, concomitantly, a significant risk of injury.”   Id.
     The same is true for ABPO, which involves similar
     dynamics.

Dancy, 640 F.3d at 470 (emphasis in bold and brackets added).20


20
 Most recently, the United States Supreme Court addressed the
question whether, under Indiana law, unlawful flight from law
enforcement by a vehicle was a violent felony for purposes of
enhancement under the ACCA. Sykes v. United States, 131 S.Ct.
2267 (June 9. 2011). In that case, Sykes argued that vehicle
flights do not involve the kind of dangers contemplated by the
ACCA residual clause. The Supreme Court rejected this argument,
stating:

     Risk of violence is inherent to vehicle flight.
     Between the confrontations that initiate and terminate
     the incident, the intervening pursuit creates high
     risks of crashes. It presents more certain risk as a
     categorical matter than burglary. It is well known
     that when offenders use motor vehicles as their means
     of escape they create serious potential risks of
     physical injury to others. Flight from a law
     enforcement officer invites, even demands, pursuit. As
     that pursuit continues, the risk of an accident
     accumulates. And having chosen to flee, and thereby
     commit a crime, the perpetrator has all the more reason
     to seek to avoid capture.

     Unlike burglaries, vehicle flights from an officer by
     definitional necessity occur when police are present,
     are flights in defiance of their instructions, and are
     effected with a vehicle that can be used in a way to
     cause serious potential risk of physical injury to
     another.

Id. at 2274. Sykes further stated that: “Serious and substantial
risks are an inherent part of vehicle flight. Under subsection
(b)(1)(A), they need not be proved separately to secure a
conviction equal in magnitude to those available for other forms
of resisting law enforcement with a vehicle that involve similar
risks.” Id. at 2276. In this case, the charges against Dubose
were Resisting Arrest and not unlawful vehicle flight. It is
noted however, that the PSR reflects that both the Resisting

                               29
     In light of the above, the Court deems the two Resisting

Arrest Offenses to qualify as predicate offenses under the ACCA.

F.   The Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claims, and the Claims
     of Error By the District Court in Applying the ACCA

     Because Dubose’s Resisting Arrest convictions constitute two

predicate convictions under the ACCA, and because the Armed

Robbery constitutes the third predicate offense sufficient to

trigger the ACCA, this Court need not address Dubose’s arguments

in detail with respect to his drug convictions (Possession of

Class B substance with Intent to Distribute), but finds this

offense also qualifies as a predicate offense.   See PSR, ¶ 38.

     In sum, upon review of Dubose’s criminal history, this Court

finds that Dubose was, and still is, subject to application of

the ACCA, notwithstanding the Court’s inability to consider the

Assault and Battery offense.   It follows, therefore, that under

Strickland, Dubose fails to establish his claim for ineffective

assistance of counsel with respect to failure to object or




Arrest offenses involved serious potential risk of physical
injury to another. In the first Resisting Arrest case, Dubose
pushed away from officers and fled, leading officers on a
pursuit. Officers caught the defendant, and he struggled while
they were placing him under arrest.... Several officers were
treated for injuries. See PSR, ¶ 38. The second Resisting
Arrest charge arose against Dubose after he was operating a
vehicle, drove into a school parking lot and jumped out of the
vehicle while it was moving, causing the vehicle to crash into a
fence on school property. See PSR, ¶¶ 39.

properly investigate as to the application of the ACCA or with

respect to the PSR information regarding his criminal history.

Dubose has not established that counsel’s performance was

deficient under the first prong of Strickland,21 nor has he shown

that any deficient performance resulted in prejudice to him (or,

for that matter, that this Court’s application of the ACCA based

on his criminal record resulted in any prejudice to him).

     With respect to the allegation that Dubose would not have

accepted a plea deal had he known he was given erroneous advice

about the application of the ACCA, this claim fails in light of

the Court’s finding that the ACCA does apply to him.   In any

event, the Court finds that Dubose’s contention in this regard is

wholly self-serving, without any evidentiary support whatsoever,

either direct or inferential, to show that, at the time of the

guilty plea, and not in hindsight, he would have not pled guilty

to the charges against him.   Thus, his assertion is to no avail.

     Similarly, Dubose’s claims of error by this Court in

applying the ACCA based only on the information contained in the

PSR is rejected.   It is proper for this Court to rely on the

with respect to his criminal history record; however, the
Probation Office declined to make any revisions based on the
objections.

information contained in the PSR.22

        Without belaboring the matter further, this Court finds that

Dubose has not met his burden to demonstrate that § 2255 relief

is warranted with respect to his enhanced sentence under the

ACCA.

        Accordingly, Dubose’s § 2255 motion is DENIED with respect

to challenges to his sentence under the ACCA, and the

Government’s Motion for Summary Dismissal is ALLOWED as to these

claims.

G.   The Claims Challenging Dubose’s Conviction are Barred

     Having addressed the issues with respect to challenges to

Dubose’s sentence, the Court now turns to challenges asserted in

connection with the conviction itself.

     1.     Claims Previously Decided on Direct Appeal

     Dubose’s challenges to his conviction are grounded on the

Police Officers’ conduct on February 22, 2007 when he was

arrested.   These challenges were the subject of his motion to

suppress, which this Court rejected.   On appeal, the First

Circuit reviewed the merits of this Court’s decision, and

affirmed.   See Dubose, No. 08-2382 (1st Cir. 2009) cert. denied

DuBose v. United States, 131 S.Ct. 536 (2010)(No. 10-6629).

     In light of this, Dubose is foreclosed from relitigating

these claims in this § 2255 motion.    See Section II(B)(1), supra

(citing cases).

     Further, this Court considers that Dubose’s assertions

regarding police misconduct add nothing new to the mix -- he

presents no new evidence nor any basis for this Court to find

that extraordinary circumstances exist showing a miscarriage of

justice would result should his claims not be considered (as, for

example, a bona fide claim of actual innocence or cause and

prejudice).   Thus, Dubose’s § 2255 motion is DENIED with respect

                                 33
to his challenge to his conviction based on alleged police

misconduct or violation of law.

     2.   The Failure to Provide Miranda Rights While in Cruiser

     Finally, Dubose raises a claim -- not in the § 2255 motion

-- but in the course of his arguments in support thereof, that he

was never given Miranda rights while he was placed in the back of

the police cruiser.23    Dubose does not expand on this allegation,

nor does he provide any context for this assertion.    This bald

assertion, without more, is insufficient to meet his burden to

warrant § 2255 relief.

     Moreover, Dubose’s claim is deemed to have been waived.       See

Colon-Cardona v. United States, 2011 WL 1238422 (D.P.R. 2011).

Like Dubose, in Colon-Cardona, the petitioner claimed, in a

§ 2255 motion, that he had not been given Miranda warnings at the

time of his arrest.     The District Court rejected this claim

because petitioner had pled guilty, and thus was barred from

raising any constitutional claims, including the failure to

receive his Miranda rights, where alleged violations had occurred

prior to the entry of the guilty plea.     Colon-Cardona, 2011 WL

1238422, at *1 citing, inter alia, United States v. Cordero, 42

F.3d 697, 699 (1st Cir. 1994) for the proposition that a guilty

Summary Dismissal.

                                  34
plea waives prior non-jurisdictional constitutional errors.

“When a criminal defendant has solemnly admitted in open court

that he is in fact guilty of the offense with which he is

charged, he may not thereafter raise independent claims relating

to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior

to the entry of the guilty plea.”   Id. at 698-99.

     Colon-Cardona further explained:

     “A guilty plea represents a break in the chain of
     events which has preceded it in the criminal process.
     When a criminal defendant has solemnly admitted in open
     court that he is in fact guilty of the offense with
     which he is charged, he may not thereafter raise
     independent claims relating to the deprivation of
     constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry
     of the guilty plea.” Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S.
     258, 267 (1973). Petitioner Colon–Cardona waived his
     right to any prior constitutional claim when he pled
     guilty.

Colon-Cardona, 2011 WL 1238422, at *1.   See Acevedo-Ramos v.

United States, 961 F.2d 305 (1st Cir. 1992)(“It is clear that a

plea of guilty to an indictment is an admission of guilt and a

waiver of all non-jurisdictional defects.   See Valencia v. United

States, 923 F.2d 917, 920 (1st Cir. 1991); see also [United

States v.] Doyle, 348 F.2d [715] at 718 [2d 1965])”)(brackets

added).

     Here, Dubose entered a conditional plea of guilty, expressly

reserving his right to have the Court of Appeals review this

Court’s March 31, 2008 Memorandum and Order denying his Motion to

                               35
Suppress Evidence.   See Notice of Conditional Plea of Guilty

(Docket No. 30).   The Motion to Suppress Evidence challenged a

warrantless search of Dubose by the Boston Police Department, on

the grounds that the stop of Dubose was not based on reasonable

suspicion that a crime had or was about to occur, the subsequent

frisk was impermissible, and the statements made by Dubose should

be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree.   See Motion to

Suppress Evidence (Docket No. 14); Memorandum in Support (Docket

No. 15).   The reservation of rights did not include review of the

issue whether Dubose had been given his Miranda rights while he

was in the police cruiser.   Thus, this Court cannot find that the

conditional plea falls outside the rationale of Colon-Cardona and

other cases cited herein, nor can this Court find that Dubose has

met his burden to demonstrate that § 2255 relief is warranted

based on the allegation that he was not given his Miranda rights

in the police cruiser.

     For all these reasons, Dubose’s challenges to his criminal

conviction are DENIED, and the Government’s Motion for Summary

Dismissal is ALLOWED.

                         III.   CONCLUSION

     Based on the foregoing, it is hereby Ordered that:

1.   Defendant Dubose’s request for appointment of counsel
     (contained in the body of his petition) is DENIED;



                                 36
2.   Defendant Dubose’s Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct
     Sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (Docket No. 62) is
     DENIED in its entirety;

3.   The Government’s Motion for Summary Dismissal (Docket No.
     64) is ALLOWED; and

4.   Civil Action No. 11-11249-PBS shall be DISMISSED in its
     entirety.24 A separate Order of Dismissal shall enter.


SO ORDERED.
