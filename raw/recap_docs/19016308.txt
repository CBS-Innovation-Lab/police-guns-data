                UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                      DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

           v.                           Criminal No. 12-cr-131-01-JL

Vincent Lenza

                                O R D E R


     The assented to motion to reschedule jury trial (document no.
7) filed by defendant is granted in part. The continuance is limited
to 30 days, without prejudice. Taken at face value, the motion
suggests that discovery was provided to defense counsel "recently,"
or less than 30 days prior to trial, and less than 3 weeks prior to
the final Pretrial conference. Because the court holds both the
prosecutor and defense counsel in this case in extremely high regard,
it won't inquire further, but the court nonetheless expresses its
concern. Final Pretrial is rescheduled to January 2, 2013 at 1:00
p.m.; Trial is continued to the two-week period beginning January
8, 2013, 9:30 a.m. In addition to various filing deadlines contained
in the local rules, the parties shall also file any in limine motions
no later than ten (10) days prior to the final pretrial conference.
Objections to motions in limine shall be filed no later than three
(3) days prior to the final pretrial conference.
     Defendant shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights within 10
days. The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting
a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the
defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ' 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv), for the
reasons set forth in the motion.
     SO ORDERED.
