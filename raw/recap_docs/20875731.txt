                          MEMORANDUM AND ORDER

WILLIAM E. SMITH, Chief Judge.

     Domingo Gonzales has filed a Motion to Vacate, Set Aside,

or   Correct   Sentence   by   a   Person      in    Federal   Custody     (the

“Motion”)   (ECF No.   203)    pursuant   to    28   U.S.C. §    2255. 1     No

hearing is necessary. 2    For the reasons stated below, the Motion

is DENIED and DISMISSED.


     1
       Included in Gonzalez’s Motion is a request to proceed in
forma pauperis.     (Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct
Sentence by a Person in Federal Custody (the “Motion”) 14-15,
ECF No. 203.)   As there is no filing fee for a motion brought
under § 2255, that request is denied.
     2
        Although Gonzalez requests an evidentiary hearing, a
defendant is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing in a § 2255
proceeding as a matter of right.    David v. United States, 134
F.3d 470, 477 (1st Cir. 1998) (citing United States v. McGill,
11 F.3d 223, 225 (1st Cir. 1993)). The Court of Appeals for the
First Circuit has stated that, even if requested, a hearing is
unnecessary when a § 2255 motion is “inadequate on its face
. . . the movant’s allegations, even if true, do not entitle him
to relief, or . . . the movant’s allegations ‘need not be
accepted as true because they state conclusions instead of
facts, contradict the record, or are inherently incredible.’”
Id. (quoting McGill, 11 F.3d at 225-26); see also United States
I.   Background 3

     This   case    arises   out    of       a   drug   transaction   involving

Gonzalez and five other men.                 On December 14, 2005, after a

drug-trafficking investigation jointly conducted by the United

States Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) and various Rhode Island

law enforcement agencies, Gonzalez and five co-defendants were

indicted for a number of drug-related offenses.                   Specifically,

Gonzalez    was    charged   with   conspiracy          to   distribute   and   to

possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine

(Count I); possession with intent to distribute 500 grams or

more of cocaine (Count II); possession with intent to distribute

an unspecified quantity of cocaine (Count IV); and possession of

a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime (Count V).

He was not charged in Count III.




v. Mosquera, 845 F.2d 1122, 1124 (1st Cir. 1988) (“Generally,
when a court disposes of a § 2255 petition without a hearing,
allegations must be accepted as true except to the extent they
are contradicted by the record, inherently incredible, or
conclusions rather than statements of fact.”).       It is the
defendant/petitioner’s burden to establish the need for an
evidentiary hearing.   McGill, 11 F.3d at 225.   Here, Gonzalez
has not met his burden of showing that his allegations need not
be accepted as true because they state conclusions instead of
facts and/or are contradicted by the record.           Thus, an
evidentiary hearing is unnecessary.
     3
       The facts are taken primarily from the First Circuit’s
opinion in United States v. Gonzalez, 570 F.3d 16 (1st Cir.
2009).    That opinion contains a lengthy description of the
events leading up to Gonzalez’s arrest, which this Court need
not repeat.
                                         2
      Gonzalez’s         co-defendants        pled          guilty    before       trial.       On

April     24,    2006,     after      a   four-day          jury     trial,    Gonzalez         was

convicted on Counts I and II, but acquitted on Counts IV and V.

On    March     6,      2007,    Gonzalez         was       sentenced     to       121    months

incarceration on each count, to be served concurrently, followed

by five years of supervised release.

      Gonzalez appealed his conviction to the Court of Appeals

for     the     First     Circuit.         The      First          Circuit     affirmed         the

conviction in an opinion dated June 24, 2009.                             United States v.

Gonzalez, 570 F.3d 16 (1st Cir. 2009).                               Thereafter, Gonzalez

timely filed the instant Motion.

II.   Discussion

      Generally, the grounds justifying relief under § 2255 4                                   are

limited.         A   court      may   grant    relief          pursuant       to    §    2255   in

instances       where     the    court     finds        a    lack    of   jurisdiction,          a

constitutional error, or a fundamental error of law. See United

      4
          Title 28 U.S.C. § 2255 provides in pertinent part:

      A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court
      established by Act of Congress claiming the right to
      be released upon the ground that the sentence was
      imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of
      the United States, or that the court was without
      jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the
      sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by
      law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may
      move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate,
      set aside or correct the sentence.

28 U.S.C. § 2255(a).

                                              3
States v. Addonizio, 442 U.S. 178, 185 (1979).                                 “[A]n error of

law does not provide a basis for collateral attack unless the

claimed error constituted a fundamental defect which inherently

results   in       a       complete    miscarriage         of    justice.”           Id.   at   185

(internal citation omitted).

      Gonzalez             raises    four     grounds      for    relief       under       § 2255.

First, he alleges that his trial counsel was ineffective because

counsel      had        an     undisclosed        conflict        of   interest,           thereby

violating         Gonzalez’s           Sixth     Amendment         right       to      effective

assistance        of       counsel.         Second,       Gonzalez     contends        that     the

Government knowingly or unknowingly used false evidence at his

trial, in violation of his due process rights.                                Third, Gonzalez

again claims that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing

to investigate the allegedly false evidence and certain wiretaps

and   phone       calls.            Finally,    Gonzalez        asserts       that    there     was

insufficient evidence presented at trial to convict him.

      A. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claims

      “The     Sixth         Amendment       guarantees         criminal      defendants        the

right   to    effective             assistance       of   counsel.”           Lema    v.    United

States, 987 F.2d 48, 51 (1st Cir. 1993) (citing Strickland v.

Washington,        466        U.S.     668,     687       (1984)).         However,         “[t]he

Constitution           does    not     guarantee      a    defendant      a    letter-perfect

defense      or        a     successful        defense;      rather,       the       performance

standard is that of reasonably effective assistance under the

                                                 4
circumstances then obtaining.”                           United States v. Natanel, 938

F.2d 302, 309-10 (1st Cir. 1991).

     A defendant who claims that he was deprived of his Sixth

Amendment      right          to     effective             assistance             of     counsel        must

demonstrate:

     (1)      that his counsel’s performance fell below an objective
              standard of reasonableness; and
     (2)      a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s
              unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding
              would have been different.

Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. at 687-88, 694; accord United

States   v.    Manon,          608    F.3d          126,      131       (1st      Cir.       2010).       In

assessing     the        adequacy         of   counsel’s            performance,             a   defendant

“‘must   identify            the    acts       or    omissions              of    counsel        that   are

alleged not to have been the result of reasonable professional

judgment,’         and       the    court      then           determines          whether,        in    the

particular     context,             the    identified            conduct           or    inaction       was

‘outside       the           wide         range          of      professionally                  competent

assistance.’”            Manon, 608 F.3d at 131 (quoting Strickland, 466

U.S. at 690).            With respect to the prejudice requirement under

Strickland,        a     “reasonable           probability              is       one    sufficient       to

undermine     confidence             in    the       outcome.           .    .    .     In   making      the

prejudice assessment, [the court] focus[es] on the fundamental

fairness      of       the    proceeding.”                 Id.      (internal           citations        and

quotation     marks          omitted).              “Unless         a       defendant        makes      both

showings, it cannot be said that the conviction . . . resulted

                                                     5
from   a   breakdown      in    the    adversary     process    that    renders      the

result     unreliable.”          Strickland,     466   U.S.    at     687;   see     also

Reyes-Vejerano      v.    United       States,   117    F.    Supp.    2d    103,    107

(D.P.R. 2000) (“The petitioner has the burden of proving both

prongs of this test, and the burden is a heavy one.”).

       Strickland instructs that “[j]udicial scrutiny of counsel’s

performance must be highly deferential.”                     Id. at 689; see also

id. (“It is all too tempting for a defendant to second-guess

counsel’s assistance after conviction or adverse sentence, and

it is all too easy for a court, examining counsel’s defense

after it has proved unsuccessful, to conclude that a particular

act or omission of counsel was unreasonable.”).                              The court

“must indulge a strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls

within     the   wide    range    of    reasonable     professional      assistance;

that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under

the circumstances, the challenged action ‘might be considered

sound trial strategy.’”               Id. (quoting Michel v. Louisiana, 350

U.S. 91, 101 (1955)).            Moreover, “[a]n error by counsel, even if

professionally unreasonable, does not warrant setting aside the

judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on

the judgment.”          Id. at 691.        Finally, “[a] fair assessment of

attorney     performance        requires    that   every      effort    be    made    to

eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct

the    circumstances       of     counsel’s      challenged     conduct,       and     to

                                           6
evaluate the conduct from counsel’s perspective at the time.”

Id. at 689.

     Gonzalez makes essentially two arguments in support of his

claim    that     his   trial    counsel,    Robert     B.     Mann,       provided

ineffective assistance.          First, he alleges that counsel had an

undisclosed      actual     conflict   of    interest        which     prejudiced

Gonzalez’s case. 5        (Mot. 5.)    Second, he asserts that counsel

failed   to     investigate     allegedly   false   testimony        and    wiretap

evidence.     (Id. at 7-8.)

     The Supreme Court noted in Strickland that “counsel owes

the client a duty of loyalty, a duty to avoid conflicts of

interest.”      466 U.S. at 688 (citing Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S.

335, 346 (1980) 6).       However, there is no per se rule of prejudice


     5
        Gonzalez states that after his sentencing, counsel
disclosed that he had previously represented Lisa Torres and
stated that “any arguments that he raised with respect to her
would be a conflict.”     (Gonzalez Aff. ¶ 6.)    According to
Gonzalez, he “continued to insist that [counsel] use wiretap
evidence to exculpate [him] but that would incriminate Ms.
Torres.”    (Id. at ¶ 7.)    Instead, counsel withdrew as his
appellate attorney. (Id.)
     6
         Sullivan    dealt   with    multiple,   or   concurrent,
representation, Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 698
(1984); Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 347 (1980), not
subsequent representation, Mickens v. Taylor, 535 U.S. 162, 175-
76 (2002).    Gonzalez contends that the same arguments should
apply   to  both   concurrent   and   subsequent  representation.
(Gonzalez Mem. 19-21 (citing United States v. Agosto, 675 F.2d
965, 970-71 (8th Cir. 1982)).)     The Mickens decision does not
support Gonzalez’s interpretation.     See 535 U.S. at 176 (“In
resolving this case . . ., we do not rule upon the need for the
Sullivan prophylaxis in cases of successive representation.
                                       7
in such cases.       Id. at 692.     Rather, “[p]rejudice is presumed

only    if   the   defendant   demonstrates    that   counsel     ‘actively

represented conflicting interests’ and that ‘an actual conflict

of interest adversely affected his lawyer’s performance.’”                Id.

(quoting Sullivan, 446 U.S. at 350); see also Mickens, 535 U.S.

at 171, 173-74 (emphasizing that an actual conflict of interest

does not result in an automatic reversal; in almost all cases,

some showing of an adverse effect is still required).

       “[T]he possibility of conflict is insufficient to impugn a

criminal conviction.     In order to demonstrate a violation of his

Sixth   Amendment    rights,   a   defendant   must   establish    that    an


Whether Sullivan should be extended to such cases remains, as
far as the jurisprudence of this Court is concerned, an open
question.”); Taillon v. United States, No. 11-cv-470-SM, 2013 WL
2107509, at *6 n.3 (D.N.H. May 15, 2013) (“It remains an open
question as to whether the actual conflict standard applies in
the circumstances of successive representation.” (citing United
States v. DeCologero, 530 F.3d 36, 77 n.24 (1st Cir. 2008))).
     Gonzalez further states that “the rule is that once a court
is apprised of the potential conflict, that there must be some
sort of on-the-record inquiry. In this case Petitioner was not
afford[ed] his due process to have this critical inquiry by the
court.”   (Gonzalez Mem. 20.)   Gonzalez misinterprets the rule.
See Mickens, 535 U.S. at 175 (“Not all attorney conflicts
present comparable difficulties. Thus, the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure treat concurrent representation and prior
representation differently, requiring a trial court to inquire
into the likelihood of conflict whenever jointly charged
defendants are represented by a single attorney (Rule 44(c)),
but not when counsel previously represented another defendant in
a substantially related matter, even where the trial court is
aware of the prior representation.” (citing Sullivan, 446 U.S.
346 n.10)).   Moreover, here the Court was not apprised of any
conflict.   (Gonzalez Aff. ¶ 6 (noting that Gonzalez confronted
counsel after the trial and sentencing).)

                                     8
actual      conflict     of    interest        adversely      affected     his    lawyer’s

performance.”           Sullivan, 446 U.S. at 350; see also Brien v.

United States, 695 F.2d 10, 15 (1st Cir. 1982) (“[T]he conflict

must       be   real,   not    some   attenuated         hypothesis       having    little

consequence to the adequacy of representation.”).                          “In cases of

‘successive representation, conflicts of interest may arise if

the cases are substantially related or if the attorney reveals

privileged        communications          of   the   former      client    or    otherwise

divides his loyalties.’”              United States v. Lemieux, 532 F. Supp.

2d 225, 230 (D. Mass. 2008) (quoting Mannhalt v Reed, 847 F.2d

576, 580 (9th Cir 1988)); see also United States v. Lopez, 625

F. Supp. 2d 76, 80 (D.R.I. 2008) (quoting Lemieux).                              The First

Circuit         has   “require[d]     a    defendant       to    show   that:     (1)   the

attorney        could   have    pursued        a   plausible      alternative      defense

strategy and (2) the alternative trial tactic was inherently in

conflict         with   or    not   pursued        due   to     the   attorney’s     other

loyalties or interests.”              Familia-Consoro v. United States, 160

F.3d 761, 764 (1st Cir. 1998).

       Gonzalez argues that counsel’s prior representation of Lisa

Torres affected his performance at trial, specifically (1) his

reluctance to cross-examine the Government’s witnesses regarding

the wiretap on Waskar Pena’s 7 phone, (Mot. 5; Gonzalez Mem. 8,

ECF No. 203-1), because any arguments he raised with regard to

       7
           Waskar Pena was one of Gonzalez’s co-defendants.
                                               9
Torres would be a conflict, (Gonzalez Aff. ¶ 6, ECF No. 203-1);

and   (2)   his     failure       to     call    Torres          as   a   defense       witness,

(Gonzalez Mem. 8).               Gonzalez states that the alleged conflict

“precluded      [counsel]        from    disclosing            and    arguing        exculpatory

evidence to the jury and the Court.”                             (Gonzalez Mem. 18; see

also Mot. 5.)         Gonzalez further contends that Torres’ subsequent

indictment for conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and making

false statements in an unrelated matter supports his assertions.

(Gonzalez Aff. ¶ 7; Gonzalez Mem. 9.)                            The Government responds

that: (1) counsel’s representation of Torres occurred nearly ten

years   prior      to   Gonzalez’s        trial;          2)   there      is    no   connection

between her case and Gonzalez’s; and 3) she did not testify at

Gonzalez’s trial.           (Memorandum of Law in Support of Government’s

Objection     to      Petitioner’s        Motion          to   Vacate,         Set   Aside,    or

Otherwise Correct Sentence Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (“Gov’t

Mem.”) 18-19, ECF No. 210.)

      First     and     foremost,        Gonzalez          cannot      show      that   counsel

“actively” represented conflicting interests.                             Gonzalez does not

dispute that Torres was a prior, not current client, of counsel.

(Gonzalez     Aff.      ¶   6;    Mann    Aff.       1,    ECF    No.     227-1.)        As    the

Government      notes,      and    Court    records            confirm,        counsel’s      last

representation of Torres terminated nearly ten years prior to

Gonzalez’s trial. 8       (Gov’t Mem. 18.)          Nor does Gonzalez assert,

or provide any evidence, that there was a connection between

Torres’ and Gonzalez’s cases.            Both Gonzalez and counsel agree

that       the   conversation   regarding    the     fact      that   Torres    was   a

previous client of counsel occurred after sentencing.                       (Gonzalez

Aff. ¶ 6; Mann Aff. 1.)             Counsel states that he was unaware of

any    conflict      during   the   trial,   (Mann      Aff.    2),   and     Gonzalez

states that he was not aware of counsel’s alleged conflict of

interest during the trial either, (Petitioner’s Reply Mot. to

Gov’t       Objection   (“Gonzalez    Reply”)      7,   ECF     No.   214).      Logic

dictates that if counsel was not aware of an alleged actual

conflict during Gonzalez’s trial, (Mann Aff. 2), and Gonzalez

did not raise the issue with counsel until after sentencing,

(Gonzalez Aff. ¶ 6; Mann Aff. 1), there could be no effect on

counsel’s representation of Gonzalez during the trial.

       With regard to Gonzalez’s allegations that counsel failed

to question the Government’s witnesses more vigorously due to

his past representation of Torres, the trial transcript belies

Gonzalez’s accusations.             Although it is clear from Gonzalez’s

synopsis of the taped conversations and his attached exhibits

that Torres is a participant in many of these conversations,

(Gonzalez Mem. 10-14; Gonzales Reply, Ex. L), not once does she

refer to Gonzalez by name.                In fact, Gonzalez does not appear on

any of the tapes, nor is he even mentioned, as counsel elicited

at trial.         (Tr. I:57:6-11.) 9           Counsel questioned Agent Anthony

Cardello     regarding         the     drug   trade       and     the     wiretaps.      (Tr.

I:56:10-I:58:15.)             He questioned Special Agent James McCormack

regarding, among other things, cellular telephone technology and

the   use    of    cell       phones    in    the    drug       trade.      (Tr.     II:46:3-

II:49:2.)              In     addition,       counsel       questioned         the     Sprint

representative,             Andrew    Arnold,       at    length     regarding       cellular

telephone technology and records, in particular (based on the

records) what constituted a completed call, what did not, and a

comparison        of    Gonzalez’s       cell       phone       records    with     those   of

Alejandro Pujols. 10            (Tr. II:114:6-II:127:5.)                  Even if counsel

did not question these witnesses as “vigorously” as Gonzalez

would have liked, it is unclear what more counsel could have

done in this regard.                 See Phoenix v. Matesanz, 233 F.3d 77, 83

(1st Cir. 2000) (“[C]hoices in emphasis during cross-examination

are prototypical examples of unchallegeable strategy.”).

      Moreover, Gonzalez provides no information regarding what

“exculpatory       evidence”          would   have       been    disclosed     or    provided

absent counsel’s alleged conflict.             He argues that the wiretaps

and pen registers

      do not inculpate Domingo Gonzalez in any drug
      transaction or conspiracy.    The conflict of interest
      precluded Attorney Mann from introducing [sic] the
      evidence to rebut the presentation being made by the
      United States and calling Ms. Torres to correct the
      presumption being presented to the jury by Government
      Counsel that the phone taps and phone pen-registers
      somehow incriminated Petitioner.

(Gonzalez Mem. 19.)       Again, however, he fails to indicate what

evidence would have been presented.             In short, he has not shown

that a plausible alternative strategy existed with regard to

counsel’s   cross-examination      of    Government      witnesses    which   was

not undertaken due to counsel’s prior representation of Torres.

      As for Gonzalez’s claim that counsel should have called

Torres as a witness, there is no evidence that counsel did not

do   so   because   of   any   alleged       conflict.     Although    Gonzalez

apparently believes that Torres was a “main player[]” in the

conspiracy, (Mot. 5), and describes her as the “‘star’ witness”

against him, (Gonzalez Mem. 8), in fact Torres never testified

at Gonzalez’s trial, (Gov’t Mem. 19).               Counsel states that he

“never contemplated calling Ms. Torres as a defense witness.”

(Mann Aff. 2.)      He added that “to the best of [his] knowledge

there was no conflict between [his] representation of Ms. Torres

and Mr. Gonzalez as Ms. Torres had no relation to the case

against Mr. Gonzalez.”         (Id.)    Gonzalez asserts that “the prime


                                        13
defense strategy should have been to call the witness who was on

the phone wiretap tapes --- to wit, Lisa Torres.” (Gonzalez Mem.

37 (bold added).)       However, the decision whether or not to call

a particular witness involves a dispute over trial strategy,

clearly    within   counsel’s    purview,      which    does    not    constitute

ineffective assistance of counsel.              See Lema, 987 F.2d at 54

(“The decision whether to call a particular witness is almost

always    strategic,    requiring   a    balancing     of   the    benefits      and

risks of the anticipated testimony.”).                In any event, there is

no evidence that counsel did not call Torres because of his

alleged past loyalty to her.

     Even    assuming    that   calling      Torres    as   a   witness    was   an

alternative defense strategy, there is no evidence that such

strategy was plausible.         See Familia-Consoro, 160 F.3d at 767

(noting that calling certain witness “would hardly have been a

plausible   alternative”).       One     can   only    speculate      as   to   what

Torres would have said on the witness stand or if, in fact, she

would have testified at all.           Torres, an “unindicted [sic] ‘co-

conspirator,’” (Gonzalez Mem. 2), was an initial target of the

investigation.      She may have asserted her Fifth Amendment right

against self-incrimination.         See Familia-Consoro, 160 F.3d at

767 (finding non-conflict motive where prospective witness not

called because potential witness “would likely have asserted the

Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination”).                    She may

                                        14
have been impeached based on her prior criminal record.                           (Gov’t

Mem. 21 n.6.)        While it is possible that her testimony may have

helped Gonzalez, it is equally possible that it could have hurt

his   case.     See    Lema,     987    F.2d    at    54    (“The   witness     may   not

testify as anticipated, or the witness’s demeanor or character

may   impress        the    jury     unfavorably           and   taint    the     jury’s

perceptions      of        the     accused;      or    the       testimony,       though

sympathetic, may prompt jurors to draw inferences unfavorable to

the accused.”) (citation omitted); see also Brien, 695 F.2d at

15 (noting that “the tactics Brien suggests that his attorney

could have pursued appear to be merely hypothetical choices”).

      The Court finds that Gonzalez has failed to show an actual

conflict based on counsel’s much earlier representation of Lisa

Torres.   Nor has he demonstrated that counsel failed to pursue a

plausible defense strategy due to his alleged loyalty to Torres.

Accordingly, Gonzalez’s conflict claim fails.

      Gonzalez next argues that counsel failed to make a “full

and through [sic] investigation of the case prior to going to

trial,”   thereby      rendering        ineffective        assistance.        (Gonzalez

Mem. 36.)      In particular, in his Motion he faults counsel for

failing   to   investigate         false   evidence,        specifically      Detective

Joseph Colanduono’s testimony, or file a motion to suppress that

testimony;     and    failing      to   investigate         wiretaps     and/or    phone

calls before December 8, 2005.                  (Mot. 7-8; Gonzalez Aff. ¶ 8.)

                                           15
In his memorandum, Gonzalez additionally alleges that counsel

should      have    investigated        whether       Torres    “was      the     same    Lisa

Torres he had previously represented.”                   (Gonzalez Mem. 36.) 11

       The Supreme Court has stated that “counsel has a duty to

make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision

that     makes      particular      investigations           unnecessary.            In    any

ineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to investigate

must     be    directly         assessed      for     reasonableness         in    all     the

circumstances,           applying      a      heavy    measure       of     deference          to

counsel’s judgments.”              Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691.                   The Court

must make this assessment from the perspective of counsel at the

time of the judgment, avoiding indulging in hindsight.                                  Id. at

689.

       With    respect     to     Colanduono’s        testimony,       Gonzalez      alleges

that     Colanduono        testified       falsely      regarding          what    he     saw.

Gonzalez asserts that because of the location of Colanduono’s

vehicle       relative     to    the    Lincoln 12     (in     which      Gonzalez       was    a

passenger)         and    the     target      location,        234     Gallatin      Street,

Colanduono       “could    never       have    seen”    what    he     testified     he    saw

therefore, need not be addressed separately.

Gonzalez and Garcia do after parking the Lincoln.                              (Gonzalez

Mem. 37.)

       Colanduono testified 13 in relevant part that he was assigned

to a task force with the Drug Enforcement Agency investigating

narcotics crimes.            On December 11, 2005, he and his partner,

Detective Enright, were conducting surveillance of the “target

location,” which was to be the object of search warrants.                           They

were        in   an    unmarked      vehicle      parked    on        Ruskin     Street,

perpendicular to Gallatin Street and directly across the street

from the target location.                Colanduono testified that he and his

partner had a view of 234 Gallatin Street.                            Eventually they

observed the owner of the residence, Waskar Pena, drive up and

park on the street.               Pena was followed by a “purplish colored”

Lincoln, bearing Massachusetts license plates, which turned into

the    driveway       at   234    Gallatin   Street   and   parked.           Colanduono

stated that he could see into the Lincoln.                    He did not believe

the windows were tinted.                 Two Hispanic males, the operator and

the    passenger,          were    the    only    occupants      of     the    vehicle.

Colanduono testified that he saw them turn toward the rear of

the seat and appear to be manipulating something in the rear


       13
        Detective Colanduono testified on the first day of
Gonzalez’s trial.   His testimony can be found at Tr. I:82:15-
I:116-11.   In the interest of brevity, however, the Court does
not cite to specific pages and line numbers in its narration of
Colanduono’s testimony.

seat.        However,     he    could       not     see    their      hands.        After

approximately 30-45 seconds, they exited the Lincoln and entered

the residence, presumably via the side door. 14                           According to

Colanduono,     it     did     not    appear      that     Gonzalez     was    carrying

anything.       The    next    time    Colanduono         saw   Gonzalez      was   while

executing the search warrants inside 234 Gallatin Street and

securing the premises.               Gonzalez was in the basement of the

house,      being     handcuffed       by    other        officers.        Thereafter,

Colanduono and other officers went outside and inspected the

Lincoln.     They found a hidden compartment in the rear backing of

the passenger seat, as well as a battery and jumper cables.

Colanduono testified that the officers were looking for a hidden

compartment     because       that    was   a     way   drug    dealers    transported

drugs. 15

      Although Gonzalez asserts in his Motion that he “was not

familiar with the 234 Gallatin St. surrounding, he ha[d] no way


      14
       Gonzalez makes much of the fact that Colanduono initially
testified that he saw Gonzalez and Christopher Garcia, the
driver of the Lincoln, enter the house from the side door but
also testified that he could not see the door.    (Gonzalez Mem.
23-24, 27; Tr. I:90:8; Tr. I:110:8.)        However, on cross-
examination, Colanduono clarified that he assumed that Gonzalez
and Garcia entered by way of the side door but that he could not
really see. (Tr. I:102:3-5.)
      15
        In fact, an undetermined amount of cocaine, a loaded
handgun, ammunition, and a scale were found in the hidden
compartment, although not by Detective Colanduono.      (Tr.
II:15:3-4.)

of knowing where Ruskin St. was located or what angle Colanduono

might      or    might    not   has   had   [sic]   to     the   Lincoln      when    he

testified at trial,” (Mot. 8), Gonzalez states in his memorandum

that the Government discovery package included a photograph of

the location of Detective Colanduono’s vehicle, (Gonzalez Mem.

28-29).         Thus, the position of Detective Colanduono’s vehicle

was   not       unknown    to   Gonzalez    or   counsel.        Moreover,     counsel

cross-examined           Colanduono    thoroughly        regarding,    among       other

things, the location of his surveillance vehicle relative to the

Lincoln; 16 whether Colanduono and his partner videotaped or took

pictures of what they saw; what Detective Colanduono actually

saw Gonzalez do; whether he could see Gonzalez’s hands; whether

Gonzalez had anything in his hands or was carrying anything when

he    exited       the     Lincoln;     whether     he     attempted     to    obtain

fingerprints from either the battery found in the back seat of

the Lincoln or the back of the passenger seat; and how much

money      ($10.00)       was   in    Gonzalez’s    possession        when    he     was

arrested.        Counsel also questioned Gonzalez at length regarding

his actions when he and Garcia arrived at 234 Gallatin Street

and parked in the driveway, as well as Gonzalez’s knowledge—or

lack thereof—of the presence of a secret compartment, drugs, and

a weapon in the vehicle.


      16
        Gonzalez acknowledges that counsel “subjected Colanduono
to a lengthy cross-examination.” (Gonzalez Reply 14.)
                                            19
       The jury acquitted Gonzalez on Counts IV and V, the counts

related to the drugs and weapon found in the car.                          (Gonzalez

Mem.    6.)      While     this      fact    is    not   determinative      of    the

reasonableness       of    counsel’s        decisions,      it   does    attest   to

counsel’s competence in discrediting Colanduono’s testimony.

       Whether further investigation is necessary is a question

left to the discretion of counsel; counsel may make a reasonable

decision      that   makes      a   particular      investigation       unnecessary.

Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691.                As noted previously, a particular

decision not to investigate must be assessed for reasonableness

considering      all      the       circumstances,       according       significant

deference to counsel’s judgments.                 See id.   In the circumstances

of this case, the Court concludes that counsel made a reasonable

decision that further investigation pertaining to the location

of Colanduono’s vehicle and his line of sight from that position

was not needed. 17        Moreover, there was no prejudice to Gonzalez


       17
        Gonzalez states that he has “newly discovered evidence”
in the form of “Google Earth” photographs of the scene and a
private investigator’s conclusion that Colanduono could not have
seen what he testified he saw Garcia and Gonzalez do before
exiting the Lincoln.   (Gonzalez Mem. 7; id., Ex. F.)    Even if
Gonzalez could meet the “cause and prejudice” standard—which is
doubtful at best—this evidence is unnecessary as the jury
acquitted him on both counts related to items seized from the
Lincoln.
     Moreover, Gonzalez’s statement that Colanduono is “now an
indicted drug dealer and alleged perjurer,” (Gonzalez Mem. 23),
is irrelevant to counsel’s decisions during Gonzalez’s trial.
The same is true with regard to Lisa Torres.      See Discussion
§ A, supra at 10.
                                            20
because, as noted, he was acquitted on the counts pertaining to

the drugs and weapon found in the Lincoln.

      Regarding   the     wiretap       and   telephone   records, 18   Gonzalez

states that counsel should have done further investigation of

the   wiretaps    prior     to    December      8,    2005,     and   that   such

investigation     “would         have     show[n]     Garcia      and    Pujol’s

relationship with Pena more deeply.”                (Mot. 8.)     It is unclear

to the Court how showing the relationship between those three

men “more deeply” would have helped Gonzalez. 19                It is undisputed

that Gonzalez was not heard on the Pena wiretaps produced at




      18
          Special Agent Anthony Cardello testified regarding the
wiretaps at issue. (Tr. I:6:21-I:8:2.) Specifically, he stated
that the cell phones tapped both belonged to Waskar Pena.
(I:6:25-I:7:1.)   Cardello further testified that the wiretap on
the first phone was in effect from October 31, 2005, through
December 11, 2005 (Tr. I:7:10-13), and that the wiretap on the
second was in effect from December 8, 2005, through December 11,
2005, (Tr. I:7:14-24).    Pena’s cell phones were the only ones
tapped.     (Tr. I:7:25-I:8:2).   Special Agent James McCormack
testified regarding the use of cell phones in drug trafficking.
(Tr.    I:142:13-I:145:21.)      Andrew   Arnold,   the   Sprint
representative, brought the customer printout records pursuant
to a subpoena. (Tr.II:101:23-II:103:1; Tr. II:106:14-II:107:8.)
      19
       It is possible that Gonzalez is referring to his argument
that the wiretaps “do not inculpate Domingo Gonzalez in any drug
transaction or conspiracy.” (Gonzalez Mem. 19.) However, there
he is referencing the wiretaps presented at trial, not the
wiretaps prior to December 8, 2005. There is no evidence before
the Court as to what information may have been on the earlier
wiretaps.   Accordingly, the Court concludes that Gonzalez is
engaging in speculation.   See Brien, 695 F.2d at 15 (referring
to suggested tactics as “hypothetical choices”).

trial, (Gonzalez Mem. 7; Gov’t Mem. 27; Tr. I:57:6-8), or even

mentioned, (Tr. I:57:9-11).

       Again, the Court notes that the matter of investigations is

a strategic decision left to counsel.              Strickland, 466 U.S. at

691.     There is no evidence that further investigation of the

Pena wiretaps would have served any purpose.                  Thus, it is within

counsel’s    ambit    to    decide    whether     or    not     to   pursue   such

investigation, and this Court will not second-guess counsel’s

strategy.        Cf. Phoenix, 233 F.3d at 84 (“Defense counsel is

allowed to make strategic decisions, within the wide bounds of

professional competence, as to which leads to follow up, and on

which areas to focus his energies.”).

       As to Torres, the Court has already discussed the conflict

issue and need not repeat that discussion here, except to make

one    further    point.      “The    decision     to     interview     potential

witnesses, like the decision to present their testimony, must be

evaluated    in     light   of    whatever      trial     strategy     reasonably

competent   counsel     devised      in   the   context    of    the   particular

case.”    Lema, 987 F.2d at 55 (emphasis in original); see also

id. (rejecting argument that strategic considerations should be

entitled to little or no deference because counsel failed to

investigate potential witnesses’ testimony).

       Gonzalez has not met the Strickland standard; although he

has specified the acts or omissions which he alleges were not

                                          22
the result of reasonable judgment, he has not shown that “the

identified conduct or inaction ‘was outside the wide range of

professionally competent assistance.’”                      Manon, 608 F.3d at 131

(quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690); see also Strickland, 466

U.S.    at    689   (quoting      Michel,     350    U.S.    at    101)   (noting     that

defendant       “must      overcome     the       presumption       that,   under     the

circumstances, the challenged action ‘might be considered sound

trial       strategy’”).         The   Court,     therefore,      rejects    Gonzalez’s

ineffective assistance claim as it pertains to counsel’s alleged

failure to investigate.

       B.      False and Misleading Testimony Claim

       Gonzalez      next    claims      that     the   Government        knowingly    or

unknowingly used false evidence at his trial, in violation of

his due process rights. 20               (Mot. 6.)          Specifically, Gonzalez

argues:       “1) that the arresting agent 21 falsely testified as to

his observations leading up to and at the time of the arrest;

and 2) that the Governmetn [sic] Counsel used the wiretap to

mislead       the   jury    as    to   the   content    and       meaning   of   wiretap

transcripts, synopsis, and pen-registers.”                    (Gonzalez Mem. 22.)



       20
       Gonzalez subsequently avers that the Government’s alleged
use of false evidence was done knowingly and intentionally.
(Gonzalez Mem. 31.)
       21
        Although Gonzalez refers to the “arresting agent,”
(Gonzalez Mem. 22), he is actually referencing Detective
Colanduono, as is abundantly clear from Gonzalez’s argument.
                                             23
       The    “false       evidence”         to    which      Gonzalez       refers      is     the

testimony      of     Detective         Colanduono.            Gonzalez       contends         that

“Colanduono’s         testimony        is    completely         false       and   contrary      to

physical evidence.”              (Id. at 27.)           Gonzalez further argues that

“the    United        States      attorney          trying      this    case       undoubtedly

‘rehearsed’      Colanduono’s           testimony        with    him    and       knew    exactly

what he was going to say.”                   (Id. at 25.)         Gonzalez asserts that

once Government counsel learned that Colanduono was going to

testify “to something that could not be seen, as shown by [the

Government’s]            own     discovery          materials,”         the       Government’s

attorney should have averted such testimony.                           (Id. at 25-26).

       As     evidence         that    the    Government’s           attorney       knew       that

Colanduono’s        testimony          was    false,      Gonzalez       states      that      the

Assistant United States Attorney (the “AUSA”) knew the position

of the Lincoln to which Colanduono was going to testify, that

the    AUSA    had       in    her     possession        a    videotape       showing         “that

Colanduono was nowhere close to 234 Galla[]tin St.,” (id. at

28),    and    that      the    AUSA    selectively           introduced      into       evidence

photographs         in    the        Government’s        discovery          package,       (id.).

Gonzalez also states that Colanduono’s partner “had a better

angle    of    view      to    the    driveway         than   Colanduono,”         (id.),      and

questions the Government’s failure to call Enright as a witness.

       Even    assuming,         solely       for      the    sake     of    argument,         that

Gonzalez’s allegation that Colanduono testified falsely is true,

                                                  24
Gonzalez fails in his attempt to link the Government to said

testimony.             Gonzales        assumes    that     the    AUSA       “undoubtedly

rehearsed” Colanduono’s testimony with him and speculates, but

provides no evidence, that the Government knowingly presented

false testimony.             Id. at 25.      That the AUSA may have discussed,

even     “rehearsed,”         Colanduono’s       testimony      with   him    before      the

trial        fails    to      show,    explicitly     or     implicitly,        that     the

Government was aware that Colanduono would testify untruthfully.

Id.     In fact, the Government represents that it “believed, and

continues        to     believe,        Detective     Colandu[o]no’s          testimony,”

(Gov’t Mem. 22), regarding his observations.                       The videotape and

photographs           were     provided     to      Gonzalez      as     part       of   the

Government’s          discovery       package.      Gonzalez     states      that    “[t]he

government’s failure to call Enright as a witness to colaborate

[sic]         Colanduono’s            testimony      creates       very         suspicious

circumstance           that     the      prosecutor      knew     that       Colanduono’s

testimony was false, since Enright had a better angle of view to

the driveway.”          (Gonzalez Mem. 28.)           This is pure speculation on

Gonzalez’s part as there is no evidence in the record as to why

the Government did not call Enright.

        With    regard        to   the    videotape 22     and    photographs,           what

evidence to introduce at trial is clearly a strategic choice


        22
       A videotape was introduced as a full exhibit and played
for the jury on the first day of Gonzalez’s trial. (Tr. I:63:2—
                                             25
which the AUSA is entitled to make, as is the decision whether

to call a particular witness to testify.                    It is certainly not up

to Gonzalez to determine how the Government should conduct its

case.     The Court cannot conclude that the Government knowingly

presented false evidence based solely on Gonzalez’s allegations.

       Turning      to    the    wiretap     and      phone    record/pen           register

evidence,      Gonzalez        accuses    the    Government        of    attempting      to

mislead     the    Court   and    the     jury   by    misrepresenting         what    they

showed:       “This type of prossecution [sic] was continued when the

Government        introduced     the     wiretaps     and   pen     registers       against

Petitioner at trial.            They continually mischaracterized them and

made    references       that    were     not    correct      nor      did    the    actual

exhibits show what was alleged to be there.”                            (Gonzalez Mem.

26.)     In short, Gonzalez contends that the Government portrayed

as completed calls that were not in order to link him to the

conspiracy.

       Once    more      the    trial     transcript        contradicts        Gonzalez’s

contention.        The Government presented witnesses who testified in

detail regarding cell phone technology, the use of cell phones

in   drug     trafficking,       what     was    indicated        in    the    subscriber

records, and, especially, when those records showed completed

calls.         (Tr.      I:142:13-I:145:21;           Tr.   II:46:10-II:49:2;           Tr.



I:70:12.)   It is unclear whether this is the video to which
Gonzalez refers.
                                            26
II:101:23-II:126:25.)       Records were compared side-by-side.           (Tr.

II:107:13-II:126:25.)       Moreover, counsel had the opportunity to

cross-examine these witnesses and took full advantage of that

opportunity.    (Tr. II:43:9-II:49:2; Tr. II:114:6-II:126:25.)

     Noting that he was acquitted on Counts IV and V, Gonzalez

states that “the jury felt that the case was a close call, and

with a proper defense and evidence would have acquitted on all

crimes.”     (Gonzalez Mem. 21.)       Again, Gonzalez is engaging in

speculation as there is no way of knowing what the jury would or

would not have done had additional evidence been presented, or

existing evidence presented differently.

     There is simply no merit to Gonzalez’s allegation that the

Government     knowingly     used    false    evidence    at      trial     or

misrepresented wiretap and pen-register evidence.               Gonzalez has

provided no evidence which would allow the Court to conclude

otherwise.     He has not met the Strickland standard.           Strickland,

466 U.S. at 687, 690.       The Court, therefore, rejects Gonzalez’s

false and misleading testimony claim.

     C.    Insufficient Evidence Claim

     Lastly,    according    to   Gonzalez,   “[t]he   entire    premise    of

Petitioner being involved in the conspiracy and drug sale, is

based on what Colanduono claimed to have witnessed and of the

wiretaps and pen-registers.”          (Gonzalez Mem. 26-27.)          Absent

Colanduono’s    testimony     and   the   wiretap   and   phone     records,

                                     27
according      to    Gonzalez,          “there       is    absolutely          nothing         on   the

record      that    links     petitioner           to    the    drug        transaction        in   any

fashion, way or manner. . . . Indeed, there is not a single

piece of evidence or action whatsoever, that the Government can

point out that petitioner did or said in furtherance of the drug

conspiracy.”         (Id. at 38.)             Gonzalez asserts that now the “real

truth”      has      been        established            about     Detective            Colanduono’s

testimony      and    the     wiretaps         and      telephone       records.           (Mot.     9;

Gonzalez      Mem.        38.)         He     therefore         requests           the    Court     to

reconsider his motion for acquittal, because the Court (and the

Government) “explicitly relied on Colanduono’s false testimony

and    on    the     undeveloped             conflicting         wiretaps          and    telephone

records” in denying his motion.                      (Gonzalez Mem. 38.)

       On the second day of his trial, after the Government had

rested its case-in-chief, Gonzalez’s counsel made an oral motion

for judgment of acquittal.                    (See Docket.)             The Court denied the

motion by oral order that same day.                            (Id.)        Counsel renewed his

oral   motion       for    judgment          of    acquittal      after        the      defense     had

rested      its     case    and        the    Government         had        presented      rebuttal

evidence.         (Id.)     District Judge Ernest C. Torres again denied

the motion.          (Id.)         Clearly he was persuaded that there was

sufficient         evidence       to    allow       the    case        to    go    to    the    jury.

Additionally,        as     evidenced         by     its   conviction             of    Gonzalez     on



                                                   28
Counts I and II, 23 the jury was convinced as to the sufficiency

of the evidence against Gonzalez with regard to those counts.

Cf. United States v. Woods, 210 F.3d 70, 77 (1st Cir. 2000)

(finding “abundant evidence from which a rational jury could

infer beyond a reasonable doubt [the defendant’s] knowledge that

he was purchasing cocaine with intent to sell”).

      Moreover, Gonzalez’s insufficient evidence claim is based

on his previous arguments, which the Court has already rejected.

Accordingly, the Court finds that Gonzalez’s insufficiency of

evidence claim lacks merit and declines to revisit the ruling on

his motion for judgment of acquittal.

      III. Conclusion

      Gonzalez has failed to demonstrate that his trial counsel

had   an    actual   conflict   of   interest    that   affected   counsel’s

performance.     Nor has he shown that his counsel’s representation

fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that, but

for counsel’s errors, the result of the proceeding would have

been different.         Thus, he has not met the Strickland standard.

The   Court    cannot    conclude    that   counsel   rendered   ineffective

assistance.      Moreover, Gonzalez has not established that the

Government presented perjured testimony or misled the Court and

the jury regarding wiretap evidence.            Finally, his argument that


      23
           As noted previously, Gonzalez was acquitted on Counts IV
and V.
                                       29
there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction lacks

merit.     Therefore,        for    the     foregoing       reasons,       and   for      the

reasons    stated       in   the    Government’s          memorandum,      the   instant

Motion    pursuant      to   28     U.S.C.    §     2255    is    hereby    DENIED        and

DISMISSED.


                  RULING ON CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY

       Pursuant to Rule 11(a) of the Rules Governing Section 2255

Proceedings in the United States District Courts, this Court

hereby finds that this case is not appropriate for the issuance

of a certificate of appealability (“COA”) because Gonzalez has

failed    to   make      a   substantial         showing     of    the   denial      of    a

constitutional right as to any claim, as required by 28 U.S.C. §

2253(c)(2).

       Gonzalez    is    advised     that     any    motion       to   reconsider      this

ruling will not extend the time to file a notice of appeal in

this   matter.        See    Rule    11(a),       Rules    Governing       Section     2255

Proceedings.

IT IS SO ORDERED:
