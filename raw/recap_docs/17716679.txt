       ORDER ON DEFENDANT’S MOTION IN LIMINE TO EXCLUDE
            CONFESSION BY ALLEGED CO-CONSPIRATOR

      With trial scheduled next week, Levell L. Matthews moves in limine to

preclude law enforcement officials from testifying about a confession by an alleged

co-conspirator, Renee Marie Weeks, while in police custody after her arrest on

December 6, 2011. Def.’s Levell Matthews’ Mot. in Limine to Exclude Confession by

Alleged Co-Conspirator (ECF No. 95). In its response, the Government concedes

that “it had and has no intention of asking such questions to law enforcement

officers.” Gov’t’s Resp. to Def.’s Mot. in Limine to Exclude Confession by Alleged Co-

Conspirator at 1 (ECF No. 101) (Gov’t’s Resp.). It observes that “such questioning

could violate the Confrontation Clause” under Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123

(1968). Id. At the same time, the Government urges the Court not to rule the

confession entirely inadmissible because the defense may ask questions on cross-

examination that elicit proper reference to the contents of Ms. Weeks’ statement.

Id. It points to Rules 401, 402, and 611(a)(1). Id. (citing FED. R. EVID. 401, 402,

611(a)(1)).

      As the parties agree that Ms. Weeks’ out-of-court statements in December,

2011 while in police custody are not generally admissible, the Court GRANTS the
Case 1:11-cr-00227-JAW Document 106 Filed 09/21/12 Page 2 of 2     PageID #: 452



Defendant’s Motion in Limine in part and confirms the Government’s intention not

to elicit such testimony from law enforcement officers during direct testimony.

However, the Court cannot foresee the scope of the Defendant’s cross-examination

of the officers and it cannot rule Ms. Weeks’ custodial statements necessarily

inadmissible for all purposes. To the extent the Defendant seeks an order ruling

the statement inadmissible even if he elicits it, the Court DENIES the motion in

part.

        SO ORDERED.
