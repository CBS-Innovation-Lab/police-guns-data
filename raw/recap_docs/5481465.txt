 2        COURT CALLED INTO SESSION

 3             THE CLERK:     Today’s date is November 16, 2004.         The

 4   Court will now hear the case of United States v. Rashaun Scott,

 5   Criminal Case No. 04-10303.       Will the attorneys please identify

 6   themselves.

 7             MR. CAPIN:     Your Honor, good morning.         My name is--

 8             THE COURT:     Good morning.

 9             MR. CAPIN:     --John Capin and I represent the United

10   States of America.

11             MR. LISTON:     Good morning, Your Honor.

12             THE COURT:     Good morning.

13             MR. LISTON:     My name is Michael Liston and I

14   represent Mr. Scott.

15             THE COURT:     We’re waiting for the marshals to bring

16   the defendant.

17   (No audible recording from #11:10:09-11:15:50)

18             THE COURT:     --the government’s motion for detention,

19   detention pursuant to?

20             MR. CAPIN:     It would be pursuant to 18 U.S.C.

21   3142(f)(1)(B), Your Honor, (f)(1)(D) and (f)(2)(A).

22             THE COURT:     And in that, the defendant is presently

23   incarcerated so that there is a United States versus King

24   issue?

25             MR. LISTON:     Your Honor, he is in custody and it’s

 1   somewhat unclear, right now I believe he is in federal habeas

 2   custody.     There is a similar charge in the Brockton Court,

 3   which I trust at some point they are going to null pross

 4   bringing him over here.          He tells me that he has been in

 5   Plymouth since October 23rd.         Yet he, the habeas that you signed

 6   on November 12th was a habeas to the Dartmouth Court.                   It seems

 7   there’s been some leeway whether there’s a detainer of some

 8   sort.   I don’t know what happened, Your Honor.               I’m sure that

 9   in time all this time will be counted for his benefit, but if

10   he’s currently in federal habeas, in theory it doesn’t count as

11   federal time.

12                THE COURT:    Attorney Capin, do you know what the

13   status--

14                MR. CAPIN:    No.     My understanding, and this is

15   Mr. Richardson’s case and I’m trying to discern from his record

16   what his status is, it’s not clear to me.                My understanding had

17   been that Mr. Scott was serving a sentence of incarceration in

18   which case there would be an IAD issue.            I think it’s

19   academic--

20                THE COURT:    A state, state--

21                MR. CAPIN:    In state custody.

22                THE COURT:    Okay.

23                MR. CAPIN:    I think it’s somewhat academic if Mr., if

24   in fact Mr. Scott regardless of whether he’s serving a sentence

25   or awaiting charges or in state custody for some other or on

 1   some other basis if he’s desire now is to stay in federal

 2   custody on these charges, then I think the IAD issue goes away.

 3               THE COURT:    All right.

 4               MR. CAPIN:    And I think we’re – and if Mr. Liston is

 5   saying Mr. Scott would like to agree to an order of voluntary

 6   detention without prejudice then I think that should resolve

 7   this custodial issue for today.

 8               THE COURT:    Do you want the Court to put this under a

 9   United States v. King or a voluntary detention and if that

10   changes, then you can inform the Court.

11               MR. LISTON:    The answer is yes to that, Your Honor,

12   because I’m assuming that in fact he has completed his state

13   sentence or would otherwise be released from his state

14   sentence.

15               THE COURT:    What charge on the--

16               MR. LISTON:    Your Honor, on his

17               THE COURT:    I should ask pretrial services which

18   charge the defendant is allegedly incarcerated on.

19               PRETRIAL SERVICES:      (Inaudible – #11:18:25).

20               THE COURT:    I have the--

21               PRETRIAL SERVICES:      It should be at the last, last

22   page.

23               THE COURT:    Why don’t you give that back to him.

24               PRETRIAL SERVICES:      The last page, Your Honor, at the

25   top.

 1               THE COURT:    10/31/03--

 2               MR. CAPIN:    Yes, Your Honor, he was--

 3               THE COURT:    --possession to distribute?

 4               MR. CAPIN:    Yes, Your Honor.      He has, he was

 5   sentenced to a guilty, two year split, one-year commitment.               He

 6   was given time from the date of his arrest cause he was in

 7   custody pending the disposition, so that he was released I

 8   think it was October 23rd or he would have been released on

 9   October 23rd.    However, on October 23rd, as I understand it, he

10   was transferred to Plymouth and I’m assuming, you know, why

11   that happened whether that would have been on a detainer from

12   the Brockton District Court for a firearm violation which is

13   essentially the state case--

14               THE COURT:    Uh-huh.

15               MR. CAPIN:    --that has now been taken over by the

16   federal government.

17               THE COURT:    So if that’s a state, if he’s being held

18   on the firearms violation then he is in state, presently in

19   state custody.

20               MR. LISTON:    He is, your Honor.          Because the only

21   federal custody we currently have is a habeas custody.

22               THE COURT:    Uh-huh.

23               MR. LISTON:    As a practical matter, one, he could be

24   found not guilty here in which case any time he spends will be

25   fed time.    If he were to be found guilty and sentenced in this

 1   court, he would get credit for the time that he has spent in

 2   the state system--

 3             THE COURT:     In the state system.

 4             MR. LISTON:     --under the statute.

 5             THE COURT:     So therefore it seems as though a United

 6   States v. King situation is applicable.

 7             MR. LISTON:     Your Honor, I’m not familiar with United

 8   States v. King.

 9             THE COURT:     Oh, that’s where you hold the, the

10   defendant is held if and until the defendant is released from

11   state custody and a detention hearing becomes necessary.

12             MR. LISTON:     Yes, Your Honor, yeah.       Okay, I

13   understand that.     I believe in this situation he has completed

14   his state sentence, his state custody from which the federal

15   has the habeas is a pretrial custody.

16             THE COURT:     He’s still in custody though--

17             MR. LISTON:     That is correct.

18             THE COURT:     --until they drop it.       So it’s the--

19             MR. LISTON:     But it’s--

20             THE COURT:     --United States v. King.

21             MR. LISTON:     That’s right.

22             THE COURT:     You can talk with Attorney Richardson--

23             MR. CAPIN:     All right.

24             THE COURT:     --if there is a change in that--

25             MR. CAPIN:     Fair enough.

 1             THE COURT:     --because it does affect whether or not

 2   the defendant gets credit.

 3             MR. CAPIN:     I think the, if it is a U.S. v. King,

 4   issue it’s only one until the state null prosses the charges--

 5             THE COURT:     Right.

 6             MR. CAPIN:     --that we’ve now adopted--

 7             THE COURT:     Right.

 8             MR. CAPIN:     --which would happen imminently.

 9             THE COURT:     Exactly.

10             MR. CAPIN:     So--

11             MR. LISTON:     He tells me also, Your Honor, that there

12   is a bail in the state case.        I’m advised of that and, I’m sure

13   the government or the federal people would have a federal

14   detainer so there’s, it would make defendant--

15             THE COURT:     Well its clear that counsel and the

16   government need to talk.        The defendant is detained pursuant to

17   United States v. King.
