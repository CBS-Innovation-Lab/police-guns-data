              ORDER ON DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS

      The Grand Jury returned an indictment charging the Defendants with

conspiracy to commit a Hobbs Act robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a) (Count

One); Hobbs Act robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 1951(a) (Count Two); and

brandishing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C.

§§ 2, 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) (Count Three). (ECF No. 1). The Defendants move to dismiss

Count Three on the grounds that conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery and Hobbs

Act robbery do not constitute crimes of violence as defined in § 924(c)(3). (ECF No.

121). For the following reasons, the motion is DENIED.


                             METHOD OF ANALYSIS

      In the parties’ initial briefing, both sides assumed that a categorical analysis

of the Hobbs Act was required. To perform a categorical analysis, I am required to

identify the minimum criminal conduct necessary for conviction under the predicate

offense’s statutory elements without regard to the underlying facts in the case. United
States v. Acosta, 470 F.3d 132, 135 (2d Cir. 2006).1 If a Hobbs Act robbery could be

committed without “the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force

against the person or property of another,” then the crime categorically is not a crime

of violence for purposes of § 924(c)(3)(A).

        At oral argument, I invited the parties to address whether it made sense to use

a categorical approach in the context of a motion to dismiss a § 924(c) count of an

indictment. It seemed strange to perform the categorical analysis for a count that is

heading to trial. Both parties pointed me to a First Circuit opinion holding that it was

not error to instruct a jury that the predicate crimes of tampering with and retaliating

against an informant were, as a matter of law, crimes of violence for purposes of §

924(c). See United States v. Weston, 960 F.2d 212, 217 (1st Cir. 1992) abrogated on

other grounds by Stinson v. United States, 508 U.S. 36 (1993). While the First Circuit

did not use the term “categorical” in Weston, the parties nonetheless believe that

categorical analysis is required.




1        If a statute is divisible and an offense can be committed in alternate ways, I may peek at a
limited number of documents (charging instrument, jury instructions, plea colloquy, plea agreement)
to see if I can determine which of the alternate offenses supported the conviction. Descamps v. United
States, 133 S. Ct. 2276, 2281-85 (2013). Once that is done, I return to a fact-blind analysis of whether
the minimum criminal conduct necessary for conviction under the alternative of the offense involved,
has as an element, the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against the person or
property of another.

         The parties agree on the question of divisibility, and I will go along with their conclusions:
(i) that the Hobbs Act is divisible; (ii) that the dividing line is between Hobbs Act extortion and Hobbs
Act robbery; and (iii) that the robbery portion of the Hobbs Act is not divisible. Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss
6 (ECF No. 121) (citing United States v. Williams, 179 F. Supp. 3d 141, 149 (D. Me. 2016)); Gov.’s
Opp’n 8-9 (ECF No. 128). Because the Defendants do not contest that they are being charged with
Hobbs Act robbery, there is no need to do any further modified categorical analysis.


                                                   2
       The Third Circuit recently addressed this precise question. Despite the

defendant and government’s agreement that categorical analysis was appropriate,

the Third Circuit resisted:

       We do not agree that the categorical approach applies here. When the
       predicate offense, Hobbs Act robbery, and the § 924(c) offense are
       contemporaneous and tried to the same jury, the record of all necessary
       facts [are] before the district court. The jury’s determination of the facts
       of the charged offenses unmistakably shed[s] light on whether the
       predicate offense was committed with “the use, attempted use, or
       threatened use of physical force against the person or property of
       another.”

United States v. Robinson, No. 15-1402, 2016 WL 7336609, at *3 (3rd Cir. Dec. 19,

2016). In addition to Robinson, a number of lower courts have pointed out that

categorical analysis does not make much sense in the case of a contemporaneously

charged § 924(c) count.2

       This growing consensus is based on the origins and purposes behind categorical

analysis. The categorical approach was designed to guide courts in determining

whether a predicate offense constitutes a crime of violence for the purposes of

fashioning an appropriate sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C.

§ 924(e) (“ACCA”). Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575 (1990). At issue in Taylor

was whether the defendant’s two prior state burglary convictions should be

considered violent felonies under ACCA. The Supreme Court unanimously held that

Sept. 8, 2016); United States v. McCallister, No. 15-171, 2016 WL 3072237, at *2-7 (D.D.C. May 31,
2016); United States v. Wells, No. 14-280, 2015 WL 10352877, at *4 (D. Nev. Dec. 30, 2015); United
States v. Morgan, No. 14-20610, 2015 WL 9463975, at *2-5 (E.D. Mich. Dec. 18, 2015); United States
v. Standberry, 139 F. Supp. 3d 734, 739 (E.D. Va. 2015); United States v. McDaniels, 147 F. Supp. 3d
427, 430-33 (E.D. Va. 2015).


                                                 3
to determine whether the burglaries qualified, the sentencing court could look only

to the conviction and the statutory definition of the offense, not to the underlying

facts involved in the particular offense.

       In reaching this conclusion, the Taylor Court focused on three factors. First,

the Court noted that “[s]ection 924(e)(1) refers to ‘a person who . . . has three previous

convictions’ for—not a person who has committed—three previous violent felonies or

drug offenses.” Id. at 600. The Court interpreted this text as congressional intent to

focus on the category of the conviction, not the underlying facts. See id. Second, the

legislative history of ACCA suggested that a categorical approach was intended. “If

Congress had meant to adopt an approach that would require the sentencing court to

engage in an elaborate factfinding process regarding the defendant’s prior offenses,

surely this would have been mentioned somewhere in the legislative history.” Id. at

601. Third, the Court pointed out “the practical difficulties and potential unfairness

of a factual approach.” Id. The Court was concerned that facts not found by a jury

would be used to enhance the Defendant’s sentence and envisioned the practical

difficulties of determining the factual basis for a defendant’s past, potentially old,3

convictions. Id.

       The Supreme Court has repeatedly restated the rationale for using categorical

analysis under ACCA. See Mathis v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2243, 2252-53 (2016);

Descamps v. United States, 133 S. Ct. 2276, 2287 (2013). The categorical approach



3       As the Third Circuit pointed out in Robinson, the most recent of Taylor’s prior burglary
convictions occurred seventeen years before the proposed application of ACCA enhancements.

                                               4
has been refined, Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13 (2005) (applying categorical

analysis to a defendant entering a plea instead of having a trial) and extended to

other statutes and guidelines. See Moncrieffe v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 1678, 1684 (2013)

(using categorical analysis to determine whether a crime is an aggravated felony

under the Immigration and Nationality Act); Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. 1, 9-11

(2004) (applying categorical analysis under definition of crime of violence in 18 U.S.C.

§ 16); Stinson, 508 U.S. at 39 (applying categorical analysis under the career offender

guideline, U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1). All these applications involve a backward look at a prior

conviction.

        The reasons used to support categorical analysis in Taylor do not fit the § 924(c)

context. First, the text of § 924(c), which uses the term “offense,” is different than

that of § 924(e), which speaks in terms of “previous convictions.” Second, the elaborate

fact-finding process that Taylor was concerned about is not going to pose the same

problems in a contemporaneously charged § 924(c) offense. The government must

plead and prove the § 924(c) count beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury, or the

defendant must admit a factual basis for a plea, so there are no fairness or Sixth

Amendment concerns.4 Finally, there are no concerns about having to relitigate the

factual basis for old convictions or rely on old, possibly inaccurate recitations of fact.

Rather, there will either be “a live case where fresh evidence will be presented to a



4       Although Weston indicates that the determination of whether a predicate felony constitutes a
crime of violence is a matter of law, this does not preclude a jury from doing the fact-finding regarding
how a predicate act was committed. I can envision either staged deliberations or questions on a special
verdict form that would allow the jury to determine the means of committing the offense before going
on to decide a § 924(c) count.

jury,” United States v. Woodley, No. 15-cr-20007, 2015 WL 7770859, at *4 (E.D. Mich.

Dec. 5, 2015), or a guilty plea that will be based on an adequate factual basis to

demonstrate whether the way in which the crime was committed had the requisite

use of physical force. Despite the agreement of the parties to the contrary, I conclude

that categorical analysis is not appropriate here and would deny the motion to

dismiss on that basis alone. But, out of an abundance of caution and because it does

not affect the outcome, I will conduct the categorical analysis.


                                     DISCUSSION

I.    Statutory Background

      The categorical analysis requires a close look at the language of both § 924(c)

and the Hobbs Act.

             Using or Carrying a Firearm During a Crime of Violence,
             18 U.S.C. § 924(c)

      Under § 924(c),

      any person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence . . . uses
      or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses
      a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime
      of violence . . . if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to a term of
      imprisonment of not less than 7 years . . . .

18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(i)(A), (ii). The term “crime of violence” as used in §924(c) means:

      an offense that is a felony and—

      (A) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of
      physical force against the person or property of another, or

      (B) that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force
      against the person or property of another may be used in the course of
      committing the offense.


                                           6
18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(3)(A)-(B). Section 924(c)(3)(A) is commonly referred to as the “force

clause,” and § 924(c)(3)(B) as the “residual clause.”

        The parties have not pointed to a Supreme Court or First Circuit case defining

the term “physical force” under § 924(c)(3). In Johnson v. United States, the Supreme

Court defined the term “physical force” for purposes of ACCA as “violent force

. . . capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.” 559 U.S. 133, 140

(2010) (“Johnson I”). Here, the parties agree that the Johnson I definition of physical

force applies. It is not clear to me that § 924(c)(3) requires violent force,5 but I will

accept the Government’s concession, at least as it is applied to the portion of §

924(c)(3) that deals with physical force against the person of another.

        Whether the residual clause under § 924(c)(3) is still valid is an open question

in this Circuit. In United States v. Johnson, the Supreme Court held that a similar,

but not identical, residual clause of ACCA was unconstitutionally vague. 135 S. Ct.

2551 (2015) (“Johnson II”).



5       In United States v. Nason, the First Circuit interpreted the term “physical force” as it is used
in the definition of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence in 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(33)(A). 269 F.3d 10
(1st Cir. 2001). After consulting Black’s Law Dictionary and other dictionaries, the First Circuit
determined that the “widely accepted” meaning of “physical force” was “characterized as power,
violence, or pressure directed against another person's body.” Id. at 16. “ ‘Violence’ is essentially a
subset of physical force involving injury or risk of harm.” Id. at 17. The parties do not analyze whether
Congress intended the term “physical force” to have a more demanding standard under § 924(c), and
I do not undertake to do that research myself. I would note that two district courts within the Second
Circuit have refused to apply the “violent force” definition from Johnson I to § 924(c). United States v.
Pena, 161 F. Supp. 3d 268, 272 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (“Pena I”); United States v. Pena, No. 14- 555-3, 2016
WL 3208913 (E.D.N.Y. June 3, 2016) (“Pena II”). Instead, the courts in the Pena cases used the “power,
violence, or pressure directed against a person or thing” standard that the Second Circuit had used
under 18 U.S.C. § 16’s definition of “crime of violence,” which has an identical force clause as § 924(c).
Pena II, 2016 WL 3208913, at *3 (quoting Santana v. Holder, 714 F.3d 140, 144 (2d Cir. 2013)).
“Although the Johnson [I] definition may be the law of the land in the context of the ACCA—which
uses a force clause that lacks reference to the use of force against property—the Santana definition
remains ‘forceful’ in the context of 18 U.S.C. § 16, and, in this Court’s view, § 924(c)(3).” Id.


                                                    7
             The Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951

      The Hobbs Act provides that:

      Whoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or
      the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or
      extortion or attempts or conspires to do so, or commits or threatens
      physical violence to any person or property in furtherance of a plan or
      purpose to do anything in violation of this section shall be fined under
      this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.

18 U.S.C. § 1951(a).

      The Hobbs Act defines “robbery” as:

      The unlawful taking or obtaining of personal property from the person
      or in the presence of another, against his will, by means of actual or
      threatened force, or violence, or fear of injury, immediate or future, to his
      person or property, or property in his custody or possession, or the
      person or property of a relative or member of his family or of anyone in
      his company at the time of the taking or obtaining.

18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(1) (emphasis added).

II.   The Defendants’ Arguments

      The Defendants make essentially three arguments in support of their motion

to dismiss the § 924(c) charge: (i) a Hobbs Act robbery is not a crime of violence

because it does not have as an element the use, attempted use or threatened use of

physical force as required under the § 924(c) force clause; (ii) a conspiracy to commit

Hobbs Act robbery is similarly not a crime of violence; and (iii) the § 924(c) residual

clause is unconstitutional in the wake of Johnson II.

             Hobbs Act Robbery and the Force Clause

      The First Circuit has not yet addressed whether Hobbs Act robbery

categorically constitutes a crime of violence post-Johnson II. Before Johnson II, the

First Circuit concluded that Hobbs Act robbery was categorically a crime of violence,

                                           8
but it did not specifically do so under the force clause. See United States v. Morales-

Machuca, 546 F.3d 13, 21 (1st Cir. 2008) (not specifying whether Hobbs Act robbery

was a crime of violence under the force or residual clause); United States v. Turner,

501 F3.d 59, 67-68 (1st Cir. 2007) (finding conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery

was a crime of violence under the residual clause).

       At least two Circuits have addressed the question post-Johnson II and

concluded that the Hobbs Act categorically qualifies as a crime of violence under

§ 924(c)(3)(A). United States v. Hill, 832 F.3d 135, 141-44 (2d Cir. 2016) (rejecting

claim that “fear of injury” under Hobbs Act can be accomplished without the “use,

attempted use or threatened use of physical force”); United States v. Howard, 650

Fed. App’x. 466, 468 (9th Cir. 2016) (“Hobbs Act robbery by means of ‘fear of injury’ .

. . qualifies as crime of violence.”).

       Three judges within this District have also recently concluded that Hobbs Act

robbery constitutes a crime of violence under § 924(c)(3)(A). United States v. Williams,

179 F. Supp. 3d 141, 154-55 (D. Me. 2016); Craig v. United States, No. 16-303, 2016

WL 5874965, at *5 (D. Me. Oct. 7, 2016); United States v. Pomerleau, No. 7-115, 2016

WL 6471202, at *2 (D. Me. Nov. 1, 2016). Numerous district courts outside this

Circuit have likewise concluded that Hobbs Act robbery categorically is a crime of

violence under the § 924(c) force clause.6


6       Blackstone v. United States, No. 99-257, 2016 WL 7469579, at *5 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 27, 2016);

v. Bailey, No. 14-328, 2016 WL 3381218, at *2-6 (C.D. Cal. June 8, 2016); Pena, 2016 WL 3208913, at

2016); United States v. Clarke, 171 F. Supp. 3d 449, 453 (D. Md. 2016); United States v. Hancock, 168

                                                 9
       The Defendants argue that Hobbs Act robbery categorically fails to qualify as

a crime of violence under the force clause for three reasons. First, Defendants contend

that the minimum criminal conduct required for a Hobbs Act robbery conviction

would be a threat of damage to property, which could be accomplished without violent

force. Second, they claim that putting a victim in fear of injury to her person could

also be accomplished without violent force. Third, and this argument is buried within

the Defendants’ fear of injury argument, the Defendants contend that Hobbs Act

robbery by “actual or threatened force” could be accomplished by force not amounting

to violent force.7

       Interestingly, the issue of whether a Hobbs Act robbery is a crime of violence

under § 924(c) is tearing through the district courts. New opinions are being filed on

this topic practically every week. So far, all the courts have rejected the argument

that the force required to generate “fear of injury to person or property” is less than

2015); Standberry, 139 F. Supp. 3d at 740; United States v. Hunter, No. 12-124, 2015 WL 6443084, at

7        The Defendants also suggest that Hobbs Act robbery could be accomplished without the
“intentional threat of physical force” and therefore categorically fail to satisfy an implied intent
requirement under § 924(c)(3)(A). Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss 2, 7. The Defendants do not develop this
argument, however, and I will not make it for them. Díaz-Colón v. Fuentes-Agostini, 786 F.3d 144, 149
(1st Cir. 2015) (“[w]e deem waived claims not made or claims adverted to in a cursory fashion,
unaccompanied by developed argument.”). I note, however, that other courts who have considered this
argument have rejected it. See, e.g., United States v. Hill, 832 F.3d 135, 143 n.10 (2d Cir. 2016);
Williams, 179 F. Supp. 3d at 153-54; Barrows, 2016 WL 4010023, at *3-4; Bailey, 2016 WL 3381218,

the force required by § 924(c).8 But the Defendants’ third argument—that the

quantum of force needed for a Hobbs Act robbery committed with “actual or

threatened force” is less than violent force—appears to have been squarely presented

only to one court. See United States v. Johnson, No. 16-29, 2016 WL 7223264, at *3-4

(C.D. Cal. Dec. 12, 2016) (holding that Hobbs Act robbery is categorically a crime of

violence). I address each of the Defendants’ arguments in turn.

             1.      Whether Fear of Injury to Property Requires Violent
                     Physical Force

      In support of their first argument, the Defendants posit a number of

hypotheticals that they claim demonstrate the minimal culpable conduct required for

a Hobbs Act robbery. A perpetrator could commit a Hobbs Act robbery by putting

someone in fear of injury to his property, for example, by merely threatening to pour

out an expensive bottle of wine, flush drugs down the toilet, delete computer records,

contaminate food, or deface art. Defs.’ Reply 2 (ECF No. 137). Since these actions do

not involve physical force capable of causing injury, they conclude, Hobbs Act robbery

categorically fails as a predicate for a § 924(c) charge.

      There are two problems with this argument. First, under the categorical

analysis, judges are directed to determine not whether there is a “theoretical

possibility” that the minimum criminal conduct would require the use of physical

force, but rather whether there is a “realistic probability.” Gonzales v. Duenas-

Alvarez, 549 U.S. 183, 193 (2007); see also United States v. Fish, 758 F.3d 1, 6 (1st




8     See supra note 5.


                                           11
Cir. 2014) (“[i]n assessing whether the elements of the candidate proposed as a

predicate crime are overbroad, we need not consider fanciful, hypothetical

scenarios.”). To show a “realistic probability,” the defendant must point to a case

where “courts in fact did apply the statute” in the manner he claims they would.

Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U.S. at 193. Here, the Defendants have not pointed to any cases

with similar factual scenarios that were actually prosecuted. The Defendants

examples are theoretically possible, but not realistically probable, and under Duenas-

Alvarez, I am not required to consider them.

        Second, the Defendants’ argument assumes that the Johnson I definition of

“physical force against the person of another” under ACCA extends to the meaning of

physical force against property under § 924(c)(3).9 Johnson I interprets the ACCA

force clause as requiring violent force or force “capable of causing physical pain or

injury to another person.” 559 U.S. at 140. Applying the logic of Johnson I to the

context of force against property, it would seem reasonable to focus on the effect of

the force on the property and to require force capable of causing damage to property.

Therefore, a Hobbs Act robbery involving the fear of injury to property is logically a

threat of force capable of causing damage to property. Accordingly, I am unpersuaded

by the Defendants’ arguments that their Hobbs Act robbery hypotheticals—which all




9        Section 924(c)(3)’s force clause reads “has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened
use of physical force against the person or property of another . . . .” 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(3)(A) (emphasis
added). ACCA’s force clause requires that the predicate offense “has as an element the use, attempted
use, or threated use of physical force against the person of another.” 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(i).


                                                   12
involve a fear of damage or destruction of property—would not have as an element

the threatened use of physical force against property required by § 924(c)(3)(A).

             2.     Whether Fear of Injury to Person Requires Use of Violent
                    Physical Force

      Defendants’ second argument is that a Hobbs Act robbery committed by

placing a victim in fear of injury to their person could be committed without violent

force if, for example, they had an intimidating style of dress or demeanor or simply

told a victim to “give me your wallet.” Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss 9. The Government

responds that a Hobbs Act robbery by means of fear of injury is designed to reach

conduct where the defendant did not make a threat, but “intentionally instilled or

exploited the victim’s fear of injury from the use of force.” Gov.’s Opp’n 12 (ECF No.

128) (quoting United States v. Pena, 161 F. Supp. 268, 280 (S.D.N.Y. 2016)).

      The Defendants have offered nothing new here. Their hypotheticals are far-

fetched, not backed up by real-life cases, and have been rejected by numerous other

courts. For the reasons set forth in Hill and echoed in Williams and every other court

that has considered it, I agree that the “fear of injury” prong of the Hobbs Act should

be interpreted as a fear of injury from the use of force capable of causing injury to a

person or property. See Hill, 832 F.3d at 141-44; Williams, 179 F. Supp. 3d at 151;

Howard, 650 Fed. App’x. at 468; cases collected supra, note 5.

             3.     Whether Actual or Threatened Force Requires Use of
                    Violent Physical Force

      In their third argument—that the means of “actual or threatened force” itself

does not necessarily involve the type of violent force required by Johnson I—the

Defendants are breaking new ground. The cases cited by the parties have mostly

                                          13
assumed or the defendants have conceded that the “actual or threatened force” clause

has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force. See,

e.g., Hill, 832 F.3d at 141-44; Williams, 179 F. Supp. 3d at 152. But here, the

Defendants boldly go where few have gone before, taking issue with the statement in

Williams that it is “self-evident that a Hobbs Act robbery committed by means of

‘actual or threatened force’ or violence meets the required ‘physical force’ element.”

Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss 8 (quoting Williams, 179 F. Supp. 3d at 152). The Defendants

argue “[a]ll force is not violent force” and provide as an example a purse snatching,

which they claim “meets the ‘actual force’ requirement of a Hobbs Act robbery, yet

does not amount to the level of force required for a crime of violence post-Johnson [I].”

Mot. to Dismiss 8.

      The Government assumes that a Hobbs Act robbery requires “violent force” as

defined in Johnson I and points to Williams and Hill. But, as discussed, those cases

addressed arguments made under the “fear of injury” clause. The Government does

not address the argument that the term “actual force” could require less force than

“violent force” under Johnson I. I do not blame the Government for not discerning

the Defendants’ argument, however, because it is poorly developed and hidden within

the Defendants’ section on “fear of injury.”

      At issue is the level of force required for a Hobbs Act robbery conviction under

the “actual or threatened force” clause. The Defendants rely on Jackson v. United

States for their argument that actual force could be less than violent force. No. 06-94,

2016 WL 3167073 (D. Me. June 6, 2016). In Jackson, Judge Singal concluded that a



                                           14
conviction for robbery under the Maine robbery statute, 17-A M.R.S.A. § 651(1)(C),

did not categorically qualify as a violent felony under ACCA’s force clause. The

Jackson decision relied on a Law Court opinion in a purse snatching case that

interpreted the Maine robbery “physical force” requirement as “any physical force.”

2016 WL 3167073, at *2 (quoting Raymond v. State, 467 A.2d 161, 164-65 (Me. 1983)).

      I agree with the Government that Jackson is distinguishable. Under Maine

law any degree of physical force is sufficient to elevate theft to a robbery, and that

categorically removes Maine robbery as a violent felony predicate under ACCA.

Jackson would be persuasive in this case only if I were to interpret Hobbs Act robbery

as committable by any degree of force.

      To interpret the “actual or threatened force” clause of the Hobbs Act for the

amount of force required, I follow the roadmap for statutory construction set down in

United States v. Nason. 269 F.3d 10 (1st Cir. 2001). First, I examine the text of the

Hobbs Act, which, as stated above, defines “robbery” as:

      the unlawful taking or obtaining of personal property from the person
      or in the presence of another, against his will, by means of actual or
      threatened force, or violence, or fear of injury, immediate or future, to his
      person or property, or property in his custody or possession, or the
      person or property of a relative or member of his family or of anyone in
      his company at the time of the taking or obtaining.

18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(1) (emphasis added). In interpreting the term “actual force,” I

assume “absent evidence to the contrary, that Congress knew and adopted the widely

accepted legal definitions of meanings associated with the specific words enshrined

in the statute.” Nason, 269 F.3d at 16. As the First Circuit did in Nason, I consult

Black’s Law Dictionary, which defines “actual force” as “[f]orce consisting in a


                                           15
physical act, esp. a violent act directed against a robbery victim.”10 Black’s Law Dict.

(10th ed. 2014).

       “Ultimately, context determines meaning.” Johnson I, 559 U.S. at 139; see also

United States v. Castleman, 134 S. Ct. 1405, 1410-12 (2014) (defining “physical force”

differently in the context of domestic violence than in the ACCA context of a violent

felony). Here the context for the term “actual force” is the Hobbs Act robbery statute,

which requires an “unlawful taking or obtaining of personal property from the person

or in the presence of another, against his will” that “obstructs, delays, or affects

commerce.” 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a)-(b)(1). Black’s Law Dictionary’s definition of “actual

force” and its reference to a violent act against a robbery victim, suggests to me that

the ordinary meaning of “actual force” in the robbery context involves something more

than any physical force. It is reasonable, therefore, that the meaning of Hobbs Act

“actual force” is force “capable of causing pain or injury” or force “capable of damaging

property.”

       In Nason, the First Circuit went on to consider whether the wording of adjacent

statutory provisions or the legislative history suggested a meaning other than the

ordinary meaning of the term used there. The Defendants here offer no statutory

comparisons and make no legislative history arguments that would suggest a

different definition. In fact, other than to suggest that a purse snatching has the




10      Interestingly, Black’s Law Dictionary’s definition of “actual force” cross references the term
“physical force.”


                                                 16
requisite force to constitute a violation of the Hobbs Act, the Defendants offer no

exegesis of what level of force is required by the term “actual force” in the Hobbs Act.

      This brings me back to the purse snatching scenario. In my opinion, a purse

snatching is capable of causing pain or injury to person and/or property. Thus, if it

met the commerce element, it could be the basis for a Hobbs Act robbery and could be

considered a crime of violence under § 924(c)(3). The Defendants have not met their

burden under Duenas-Alvarez of providing examples of real Hobbs Act robbery

prosecutions involving actual or threatened force not capable of causing injury. See

549 U.S. at 193.

      To summarize, I conclude that all the means of committing a Hobbs Act

robbery—actual or threatened force, violence, and placing a person in fear of injury

to person or property—have as an element the use, attempted use or threatened use

of physical force as defined by Johnson I.

             Hobbs Act Conspiracy and the Force Clause

      The Defendants argue that conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery does not

“have as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force

against the person or property of another.” Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss 9. Because

conspiracy requires as little as a “tacit understanding” with no overt act, the

Defendants argue, there is no conduct element that would satisfy § 924(c)(3)(A). Defs.’

Reply 3 (quoting United States v. Palmer, 203 F.3d 55, 63 (1st Cir. 2000)).

      The First Circuit has previously held that conspiracy to commit a crime of

violence is itself a crime of violence under § 924(c). Turner, 501 F.3d at 68. However,

this conclusion was made in the context of the residual clause’s “substantial risk” of
                                             17
physical force requirement. It seems plain to me that the “use, attempted use, or

threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another” is not an

element of conspiracy, which requires simply the intent to enter into an agreement

and the intent to achieve the criminal objective of that agreement. See United States

v. Gore, 636 F.3d 728, 731 (5th Cir.2011); United States v. White, 571 F.3d 365, 368-

69 (4th Cir. 2009), abrogated on other grounds by Johnson II, 135 S. Ct. 2551; United

States v. King, 979 F.2d 801, 801-03 (10th Cir.1992); United States v. Baires-Reyes,

No. 15-122, 2016 WL 3163049, at *2 (N.D. Cal. June 7, 2016); United States v.

Edmundson, 153 F. Supp. 3d 857, 859-60 (D. Md. 2015). I therefore conclude that

conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery is categorically not a crime of violence under

the force clause of § 924(c)(3)(A).

              The Residual Clause

       My conclusion that conspiracy is not categorically a crime of violence under

§ 924(c)(3)(A) raises the issue of whether conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery

constitutes a crime of violence under § 924(c)(3)(B). As introduced above, § 924(c)’s

definition of “crime of violence” has a residual clause in addition to a force clause,

which covers any felony “that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical

force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of

committing the offense.” § 924(c)(3)(B).

       In Johnson II, the Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of the

residual clause found in ACCA. The ACCA residual clause defines a violent felony as

“any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year . . . that . . . is

burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct
                                           18
that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.” § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).

The Supreme Court held:

       Two features of [ACCA’s] residual clause conspire to make it
       unconstitutionally vague. In the first place, the residual clause leaves
       grave uncertainty about how to estimate the risk posed by a crime. It
       ties the judicial assessment of risk to a judicially imagined “ordinary
       case” of a crime, not to real-world facts or statutory elements. . . .

       At the same time, the residual clause leaves uncertainty about how
       much risk it takes for a crime to qualify as a violent felony. It is one
       thing to apply an imprecise “serious potential risk” standard to real-
       world facts; it is quite another to apply it to a judge-imagined
       abstraction. By asking whether the crime “otherwise involves conduct
       that presents a serious potential risk,” moreover, the residual clause
       forces courts to interpret “serious potential risk” in light of the four
       enumerated crimes—burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving
       the use of explosives. . . . By combining indeterminancy about how to
       measure the risk posed by a crime with indeterminancy about how much
       risk it takes for the crime to qualify as a violent felony, the residual
       clause produces more unpredictability and arbitrariness than the Due
       Process Clause tolerates.

Johnson II, 135 S. Ct. at 2557-58. In reaching its conclusion, the Supreme Court

noted that Johnson II marked the fifth time it had dealt with whether a crime fell

under ACCA’s residual clause. Id. at 2558-60.

       The Defendants argue that § 924(c)’s residual clause, like ACCA’s, is

unconstitutionally vague.11 Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss 11-13. Both statutes, the

Defendants argue, call for categorical analysis to determine whether conduct in the

“ordinary case” of an offense poses a “substantial risk.” See Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss 11-

13; see also Johnson II, 135 S. Ct. at 2557-58.



11     Under the Fifth Amendment, a criminal statute is impermissibly vague where it “fails to give
ordinary people fair notice of the conduct it punishes, or so standardless that it invites arbitrary
enforcement.” United States v. Johnson, 135 S. Ct. 2551, 2556 (2015) (“Johnson II”).


                                                19
       The Government argues that § 924(c)’s residual clause remains viable after

Johnson II because it is distinguishable from ACCA’s residual clause in five material

aspects. For its first two arguments, the Government focuses on the differences in the

language in the statutes. It claims that § 924(c)’s residual clause is “more targeted

and straightforward” because it “confines the risk assessment to only those risks that

arise during the commission of the offense” and speaks in terms of “force” rather than

“injury.” Gov.’s Opp’n 15-16. Third, the Government contends that the enumerated

list in ACCA’s residual clause introduces a level of confusion not found in §

924(c)(3)(B). Gov.’s Opp’n 16-17. Fourth, the Government argues that § 924(c), which

sets forth a new offense only if perpetrated with a firearm, functions differently and

more narrowly than ACCA, which identifies offenses for a recidivist enhancement.

Gov.’s Opp’n at 17. Finally, the Government points out that “[i]n contrast to its ACCA

jurisprudence, the Court has never had occasion to resolve a disputed question about

the meaning” of § 924(c)’s residual clause. Gov.’s Opp’n 17. And, when the Court

addressed the 18 U.S.C. § 16(b) residual clause, which is worded identically to

§ 924(c)(3)(B), its interpretation of what conduct constitutes an “ordinary case” was

unanimous. Gov.’s Opp’n 17 (citing Leocal, 543 U.S. at 10).

       I acknowledge that if a categorical approach is mandated,12 § 924(c)’s residual

clause requires an assessment of risk as applied to an “ordinary case” abstraction.

Whether § 924(c)’s residual clause survives depends on whether one reads Johnson



12      Again, I am reminded how this whole controversy could be avoided if we jettisoned the
categorical approach for contemporaneously charged § 924(c) counts. To me it makes little sense to
imagine the “ordinary case” when we will have real-world facts that can be tried to a jury.


                                               20
II broadly or narrowly. See, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez-Longoria, 831 F.3d 670,

675-76 (5th Cir. 2016) (en banc) (upholding the constitutionality of § 16(b)’s residual

clause and suggesting that Johnson II should be read narrowly “as a long-considered

ill-ease and eventual repudiation of the categorical approach in the specific context of

the Armed Career Criminal Act’s residual clause.”). I see little point in getting out

ahead of the Supreme Court in this complicated area.

        I agree with the Second, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits that § 924(c)’s residual

clause is distinct enough from ACCA’s residual clause to uphold its constitutionality.

        [S]everal factors distinguish the ACCA residual clause from
        § 924(c)(3)(B). First, the statutory language of § 924(c)(3)(B) is distinctly


13      The majority of district courts to consider this issue have also distinguished § 924(c)(3)(B) from
ACCA’s residual clause. See United States v. Moreno-Aguilar, No. 13-496, 2016 WL 4089563, at *6-9
(D. Md. Aug. 2, 2016); Kundo v. United States, No. 16-436, 2016 WL 3079755, at *2-3 (D. Utah, May

      narrower, especially in that it deals with physical force rather than
      physical injury. Second, the ACCA residual clause is linked to a
      confusing set of examples that plagued the Supreme Court in coming up
      with a coherent way to apply the clause, whereas there is no such
      weakness in § 924(c)(3)(B). Third, the Supreme Court reached its void-
      for-vagueness conclusion only after struggling mightily for nine years to
      come up with a coherent interpretation of the clause, whereas no such
      history has occurred with respect to § 924(c)(3)(B). Finally, the Supreme
      Court was clear in limiting its holding to the particular set of
      circumstances applying to the ACCA residual clause, and only some of
      those circumstances apply to § 924(c)(3)(B).

Taylor, 814 F.3d at 376.

      Because I hold that the residual clause under § 924(c) is constitutional after

Johnson II, I easily conclude that the Hobbs Act conspiracy count is a crime of

violence under the residual clause. Turner, 501 F.3d at 68 (“[c]onspiracy under the

Hobbs Act constitutes a ‘crime of violence’ for purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)).


                                   CONCLUSION

       For the reasons stated above, the Court DENIES the Defendants’ motion.
