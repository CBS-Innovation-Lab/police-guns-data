                      UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND


UNITED STATES                        :
                                     :
vs.                                  :           CR No. 06-135-S
                                     :
JUAN FORBES                          :


                                     ORDER

      Juan Forbes has filed a motion to extend time to file a motion

to vacate sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 in the above

matter.1

      This motion must be denied.        First, the motion is premature.

From this Court’s records it appears that Forbes' conviction for

federal drug and gun offenses was affirmed by the First Circuit on

January 9, 2009.         As such, his conviction became final 90 days

thereafter, i.e. on or about April 9, 2009, and he would have one

year from that date -- until April 9, 2010 -- to file a § 2255

motion.

      Second,   even     if   not   premature,   this   Court     is   without

jurisdiction to grant it.           Although the First Circuit has not

directly addressed this issue, other courts have determined that a

district court is without jurisdiction to extend the time to file

a   2255   motion   to    vacate,   unless   such   motion   to    extend   is


      1
       Forbes has entitled his motion, "Motion for Extended Time
Inference[sic] to Tolling of Filing of 28 USC 2255 as Timely," but
this Court construes it as a motion to extend, as described above.

accompanied or preceded by the motion to vacate. See Green v.

United States, 260 F.3d 78, 82-83 (2d Cir. 2001) (a district court

does   not   have   subject-matter    jurisdiction    to   extend   one-year

limitation period to file §2255 motion unless “(1) the moving party

requests the extension upon or after filing an actual section 2255

motion,   and   (2)   ‘rare   and   exceptional’   circumstances     warrant

equitably tolling of limitations period”); United States v. Miller,

No. 06-CR-20080, 2008 WL 4541418 (C.D. Ill. Oct. 9, 2008) (same);

United State v. Leon, 203 F.3d 162, 164 (2d Cir. 2000) (federal

court lacks jurisdiction to consider timeliness of a §2255 petition

until a petition is actually filed).          This is because without the

filing of an actual motion for post-conviction relief, “there is no

case or controversy to be heard, and any opinion [a district court]

were to render on the timeliness issue would be merely advisory.”

Green, 260 F.3d at 82 (quoting Leon, 203 F.3d at 164).

       Here, Forbes’ motion to extend is not accompanied by any §2255

motion to vacate, nor does not the motion itself articulate any

cognizable claim under § 2255.            In the absence of such a claim,

this Court lacks jurisdiction to grant such extension, and Forbes’

motion for extension must be denied. See Green, 260 F.3d at 83.

       In view of the foregoing, it is hereby ORDERED that Forbes’

motion to extend the time to file his § 2255 petition be DENIED.

This denial is without prejudice to Forbes’ timely filing a § 2255

motion to vacate, if he so chooses.

IT IS SO ORDERED:
