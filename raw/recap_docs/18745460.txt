                       IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                         FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO



UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,                                    CR. NO. 05-235 (CCC)

       Plaintiff,

       v.

CARLOS OLIVERAS-GONZALEZ [2],

       Defendant.


             MAGISTRATE JUDGE’S REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
                  RE: MOTION TO DISMISS THE INDICTMENT


       The superseding indictment (Docket No. 132) in this case charges defendant Carlos Oliveras-

González (“Oliveras”), and others, with various drug trafficking offenses under 21 U.S.C. §§ 841

and 846, and related firearms offenses under 18 U.S.C. §924(c). Before the court are Oliveras’s

motion to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy grounds (Docket No. 559) and the

government’s opposition. (Docket No. 561). This matter was referred to me for a report and

recommendation by the presiding district judge. (Docket No. 563, 567). For the reasons that follow,

I recommend that defendant’s motion be denied.

                                        BACKGROUND

       Trial by jury in this case began on August 4, 2010. On that day, the court impaneled and

swore in a jury of twelve jurors and two alternates, and heard the testimony of one witness. (Docket

No. 526, 530).

       The second day of trial did not go as smoothly. That morning, a daily newspaper in Puerto

Rico published an article about the case, stating that Oliveras had been convicted and sentenced at

a previous trial, that his conviction had been overturned, and that codefendants had pled guilty. This

prompted the defense to move the court to poll the jurors individually as to whether they had been

tainted by the article. (Docket No. 529). The court granted defendant’s request and proceeded to poll

the jurors in chambers one-by-one as to whether they had read the newspaper article. (Docket No.

231). This process soon revealed that, contrary to the court’s instructions, Juror Number 18 had

read the article and had discussed it with other jurors. The defendant requested that Juror Number

18 be dismissed, and the court granted this request. (Docket No. 561-1, p. 40, 44).

        The court also questioned Juror Number 7 and discovered that he had heard about the article.

It was further revealed that Juror Number 7 suffered from hearing problems and that he had not heard

parts of the testimony and court proceedings the previous day. The defendant moved to dismiss

Juror Number 7, and the court granted this request. (Docket No. 561-1, p. 68-78, 82; Docket No.

531).

        At that point, the court and parties were still left with twelve jurors. However, the court

subsequently questioned Juror Number 25. Although Juror Number 25 did not appear to be tainted

by the newspaper article, this juror repeatedly stated that, after hearing the evidence the government

had presented thus far in the case, she believed that the defendant was required to prove his

innocense. (Docket No. 561-1, p. 118-21). This prompted the defense to move for Juror Number

25's disqualification (Docket No. 561-1, p. 121), which the court granted, based on the juror’s

apparent inability to follow the court’s instructions that the government at all stages had the burden

to prove the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and that the defendant was not required to

prove his innocense. (Docket No. 561-1, p. 122).

REPORT AND RECOM M ENDATION

        With the disqualification of Juror Number 25, only eleven jurors remained. The court

therefore asked the parties if they would stipulate to continuing the case with fewer than twelve

jurors, to which defendant’s counsel replied, “The answer is no, Judge. I have discussed that with

my client and there is no stipulation.” (Docket No. 561-1, p. 127). The court then informed that the

jury would have to be discharged and the case will have to start over with another jury. The court

then discussed with counsel the need to ensure that the new jurors would understand the fundamental

rights of a person accused of a crime, to which defendant’s counsel responded, “Definitely.” The

judge then brought the jury into the courtroom and informed that the jury would be discharged. The

defense made no objection to the discharge of the jury either in chambers or in open court. Finally,

the court asked if the parties objected to discharging the jury in the jury room, and defendant’s

counsel said she did not object. (Docket No. 561-1, p. 127-29).

                                                DISCUSSION

        Oliveras moves to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that retrial with a new jury would

violate the Double Jeopardy Clause, which provides that no person will “be subject for the same

offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” U.S. CONST. amend. V. The Double Jeopardy

Clause bars a second prosecution for the same offence only if jeopardy attached in the first

proceeding. Jeopardy attaches in a jury trial when the jury is impaneled and sworn. United States

v. Pierce, 60 F.3d 886, 889 (1st Cir. 1995).

        When the original proceeding ends in a mistrial, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar

retrial if, taking all the circumstances into consideration, there is manifest necessity for declaring the

mistrial. United States v. Brown, 426 F.3d 32, 37-38 (1st Cir. 2005). In considering the need to

declare a mistrial, the court must explore viable alternatives to a mistrial. Id.; United States v.

Cr. 05-235 (CCC)
REPORT AND RECOM M ENDATION

Toribio-Lugo, 376 F.3d 333, 39 (1st Cir. 2004). “Before ordering a mistrial, the court must give

each defendant and the government an opportunity to comment on the propriety of the order, to state

whether that party consents or objects, and to suggest alternatives.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.3.

        Even in the absence of manifest necessity, when a mistrial is granted at the defendant’s

request, the Double Jeopardy Clause precludes retrial only if the government has acted in bad faith

in provoking the defense into requesting the mistrial. United States v. Dinitz, 424 U.S. 600, 611-12

(1976). Moreover, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar retrial when the defendant fails to

object to a mistrial despite ample opportunity to do so. United States v. McIntosh, 380 F.3d 548,

554-55 (1st Cir. 2004) (consent to mistrial implied when defendant failed to object to declaration

of mistrial); United States v. DiPietro, 936 F.2d 6, 11 (1st Cir. 1991).

        In this case, the court, by discharging the jury, effectively declared a mistrial in the original

proceeding. Moreover, the defense did not specifically request a mistrial or the discharge of the jury.

Therefore, under the scenario before the court, the Double Jeopardy Clause permits retrial on the

same charges only if: (1) there was manifest necessity for declaring a mistrial, taking all the

circumstances into account; Brown, 426 F.3d at 27-28; or (2) the defendant consented to the mistrial.

McIntosh, 380 F.3d at 554-55. After careful consideration, I find that both of these circumstances

were present in this case.

        First, the mistrial resulted from manifest necessity. The incident regarding the newspaper

article, and the consequent polling of the jury, resulted in the disqualification of three jurors at the

defendant’s request. Since the original jury contained fourteen members (twelve jurors and two

alternates), the available number of jurors fell below the required twelve. See Fed. R. Crim. P.

23(b)(1). The court then proceeded to consider a practical alternative to a mistrial: proceeding with

United States v. Carlos Oliveras-González [2]                                                      Page 5

eleven jurors by agreement of the parties. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 23(b)(2)(A). The court specifically

asked if the parties would stipulate to proceeding with eleven jurors, to which the defense replied,

“The answer is no, Judge. I have discussed that with my client and there is no stipulation.” (Docket

No. 561-1, p. 127). The court’s exploration of proceeding with eleven jurors, and the defendant’s

clear rejection of that alternative, stand in stark contrast to the facts of Toribio-Lugo, where the First

Circuit found no manifest necessity for mistrial after the defendant merely expressed a preference

to wait for a missing juror rather than to proceed with eleven. 376 F.3d at 38-39.

        Oliveras, nevertheless, argues that the court failed to consider two other possible alternatives

to mistrial, namely continuing the trial before the judge without a jury or impaneling an additional

juror. Importantly, however, the defendant failed to suggest either of these alternatives to the court

at any time before the jury was discharged. As the First Circuit has noted, “‘Judges are not expected

to be mind readers. Consequently, a litigant has an obligation to spell out its arguments squarely and

distinctly, or else forever hold its peace.’” McIntosh, 380 F.3d at 555, quoting United States v.

Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990). Moreover, there is nothing in the record to suggest that

either of these after-the-fact suggestions would have been acceptable to the defense. In fact, the

defendant’s request to disqualify Juror Number 7 because he did not hear parts of the first day’s

testimony strongly suggests that the defendant would not have been amenable to one of his after-the-

fact suggestions, namely, the impaneling of additional jurors who would have missed the entirety

of the first day’s testimony. In short, the totality of the circumstances dictate that the mistrial was

declared due to manifest necessity and after the court adequately considered the clear practical

alternative of proceeding with eleven jurors.

        The record also reveals that the defendant, through counsel, consented to the discharge of the

jury. While meeting with the attorneys in chambers, and after the defense counsel informed that the

defendant would not consent to proceeding with eleven jurors, the court stated its intention to

discharge the jury and start again with a new jury. The court further suggested that the court and

counsel meet to discuss ways in which to ensure that the next jury would better understand

fundamental principles regarding the rights of the accused. The defendant’s attorney did not voice

any objection to the court’s intent to discharge the jury and to start over with a new jury, and

affirmatively agreed with (“Definitely”) with the court’s suggestions regarding the new jury. The

court went on to discuss with counsel when the retrial would start, with the defendant’s counsel

suggesting, “Monday at 10, remember I have my 9:00 [commitment].” The judge and the attorneys

then went into the courtroom, whereupon the court informed the jury that it would be discharged

because there were fewer than twelve jurors. Again, the defendant voiced no objection. Finally, the

judge asked if there was any objection that the actual discharge of the jurors take place in the jury

room, and defendant’s counsel replied, “Defense has none, Your Honor.” (Docket No. 561-1, p. 127-

29).

        All of these circumstances evince that the defendant either expressly, or at least impliedly,

consented to the discharge of the jury. In DiPietro, the First Circuit found that the very similar

behavior from defense counsel constituted consent to a mistrial:

                But defense counsel did not object. For several minutes after the
                decision was announced, she and the government counsel and the trial
                judge remained in the courtroom. She listened to the court’s record
                explanation for the reason for a mistrial and did not object. She
                formulated and stated a motion for judgment of acquittal and did not
                object to the mistrial. Finally, she consulted her calendar and
                discussed with the court and government counsel acceptable dates for
                a new trial, and scheduled the trial. But she did not object to the
                mistrial.

936 F.2d at 11. Here, the defense had ample opportunity to object, both in chambers and in open

court, to the court’s stated intention to discharge the jury. The failure to do so, given the

circumstances on record, constitutes consent to the granting of a mistrial. McIntosh, 380 F.3d at 555

(“To preserve his or her double jeopardy rights, a criminal defendant must object to a mistrial at the

time the mistrial is declared.”). Accordingly, I recommend that the motion to dismiss on double

jeopardy grounds be denied.

                                                CONCLUSION

        For the foregoing reasons, I recommend that defendant Oliveras’s motion to dismiss the

indictment be DENIED.

        This report and recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 636(b)(1)(B) and Rule 72(d)

of the Local Rules of this Court. Any objections to the same must be specific and must be filed with

the Clerk of Court within fourteen (14) business days. Failure to file timely and specific objections

to the report and recommendation is a waiver of the right to appellate review. See Thomas v. Arn,

474 U.S. 140, 155 (1985); Davet v. Maccorone, 973 F.2d 22, 30-31 (1st Cir. 1992); Paterson-Leitch

Human Servs., 836 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1987).

        IT IS SO RECOMMENDED.
