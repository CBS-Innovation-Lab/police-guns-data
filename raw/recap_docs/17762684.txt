                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND



UNITED STATES

      v.                                               CR. No. 11-019-01-ML

SAMOL MOM



                            MEMORANDUM AND ORDER

      Petitioner Samol Mom (“Mom”), proceeding pro se, has filed a

timely motion      to   vacate, set    aside,    or   correct   his   sentence

pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.         For the reasons stated below, the

motion is denied.

      I.   Background and Travel

      On March 30, 2011, Mom pleaded guilty to possessing a firearm

after having been convicted of a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C.

§922(g)(1). According to the prosecution’s version of events, Mom

was arrested in September 2010 by police officers responding to a

report of shots fired in a Providence neighborhood. Upon arriving

at the scene, the officers received witness information regarding

a   gray   Lexis   automobile    leaving   the   area.   The    witness   also

described the driver of the Lexis and his passenger and was able to

provide the Rhode Island registration of the car.

      The officers proceeded to the address at which the car was

registered and observed the Lexis parked behind the house located


                                      1
Case 1:11-cr-00019-ML-PAS Document 37 Filed 06/04/13 Page 2 of 11 PageID #: 156



at that address. The officers observed two individuals hunched

forward inside the car and it appeared that the men were retrieving

or placing something beneath the seats. As one of the officers

removed the driver from the Lexis, he noticed the handle of a

handgun protruding from beneath the driver’s seat. The driver was

identified as Mom. A search of the Lexis revealed a loaded semi-

automatic handgun under the driver’s seat.1 The firearm was test

fired and was found to be operable; it was also identified as a

stolen    weapon.2   Mom   was   determined    to   have   been   previously

convicted of several felony offenses.

      In March 2011, Mom - who was represented throughout the

subsequent criminal proceedings by counsel appointed for him -

entered into a plea agreement with the government, pursuant to

which he agreed to plead guilty to being a felon in possession of

a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §922(g)(1). During the course

of a change of plea hearing on March 30, 2011, Mom pleaded guilty

to the charged offense and agreed to the factual presentation of

the evidence by the government. On June 16, 2011, Mom was sentenced

to 63 months of incarceration and a term of 36 months of supervised

release. Mom’s sentence was based on a criminal history category VI

     The passenger was identified as Elliott Marzette; a loaded
semi-automatic pistol was found under the passenger seat.

     Mom disputed that the firearm was stolen and did not admit to
this allegation in his plea colloquy.

                                      2
Case 1:11-cr-00019-ML-PAS Document 37 Filed 06/04/13 Page 3 of 11 PageID #: 157



and a total offense level of 19 (a base offense level 20, increased

by 2 levels because the firearm was stolen, decreased by a 3 level

adjustment    for   acceptance    of   responsibility),    resulting    in   a

sentencing guideline range of 63 to 78 months.

      In accordance with his plea agreement, because the sentence

imposed by the Court was within the guideline range determined by

the Court, Mom did not file a direct appeal of his conviction and

sentence. Instead, Mom filed a collateral appeal pursuant to 28

U.S.C. §2255, in which he asserts that his three prior felony drug

convictions - which qualified him as a felon, and on which his

criminal history category was calculated - had been amended to

misdemeanors. (Docket # 25). In addition, Mom filed a motion

requesting a Rule 11 hearing3 and for the sentencing transcripts

(Docket # 26). Mom opposed the government’s request (Docket # 29)

for additional time to respond to Mom’s §2255 motion and to obtain

certified copies of the judgments of conviction at issue. (Docket

# 30). After the government filed a response in opposition to Mom’s

§2255 motion (Docket # 31), Mom filed a motion to amend his §2255


      3

     No hearing is required in this matter because the files of
this case conclusively establish that the claims in Mom’s §2255
motion are without merit. David v. United States, 134 F.3d 470,
477-478 (1st Cir.1998)(“Even if a hearing is requested, a district
court properly may forgo it when (1) the motion is inadequate on
its face, or (2) the movant's allegations, even if true, do not
entitle him to relief, or (3) the movant's allegations ‘need not be
accepted as true because they state conclusions instead of facts,
contradict the record, or are ‘inherently incredible.’”)(quoting
United States v. McGill, 11 F.3d 223, 225-226 (1st Cir.1993)).

                                       3

motion by adding a memorandum thereto. (Docket # 32). In this

additional filing, Mom suggested, inter alia, that he received

ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel failed to

assert that (1) this Court had no jurisdiction over the case

because charges for the same criminal conduct were pending in state

court;    (2)   the    “government      did    not    have   ...   legislative

jurisdiction over the location where the alleged events giving rise

to the offense transpired”; (3) a defendant who serves less than

one year on a conviction is not considered a felon; (4) the search

and seizure of Mom occurred in violation of the Fourth Amendment of

the Constitution; and (5) Mom’s counsel failed to conduct any pre-

trial investigation and/or discovery. Thereafter, Mom filed a

motion requesting the “right to reply at a later date in lieu of

his recently filed amendment.” (Docket # 33). Finally, Mom filed a

motion requesting that the Court take judicial notice of that fact

that   Mom   has   taken   steps   to       vacate   his   prior   state   court

convictions. (Docket # 34).

       II. Standard of Review

       Pursuant to Section 2255, a prisoner may move to vacate, set

aside or correct his sentence “upon the ground that the sentence

was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United

States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such

sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum

authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack .

. .”   28 U.S.C. § 2255(a).       Relief under Section 2255 is available

to the petitioner only if the Court finds a lack of jurisdiction,

constitutional error, or a fundamental error of law.                     See United

States v. Addonizio, 442 U.S. 178, 184-84, 99 S.Ct. 2253, 60

L.Ed.2d 805    (1979) (holding that “an error of law does not provide

a   basis   for   a   collateral      attack    unless     the    claimed      error

constituted a ‘fundamental defect which inherently results in a

complete miscarriage of justice.’”)(quoting Hill v. United States,

368 U.S. 424, 428, 82 S.Ct. 468, 471, 7 L.Ed.2d 417 (1962)).

       A fundamental error of law is a defect “‘which inherently

results in a complete miscarriage of justice’ or ‘an omission

inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.’”

Knight v. United States, 37 F.3d 769, 772 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting

Hill   v.   United    States,   368     U.S.   at   428,   82    S.Ct.    at   471).

Sentencing error claims are generally not cognizable in a §2255

proceeding, absent “exceptional circumstances.” Knight, 37 F.3d at

773–74.

       III. Mom’s §2255 Motion

       In his §2255 motion, Mom asserts four grounds for his request

to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. Mom’s Mot. Page 4 of

6 (Docket # 25). First, Mom states that his guilty plea was not

made   knowingly,     willingly    or    intelligently.         Id.   Second,    Mom

contends that he was provided with ineffective assistance of

counsel who, Mom alleges, provided him with misadvice. Id. Third,


                                         5
Case 1:11-cr-00019-ML-PAS Document 37 Filed 06/04/13 Page 6 of 11 PageID #: 160



Mom states that his waiver of the right to pursue a direct appeal

was not knowingly, willingly and intelligently made, because he was

given incorrect and inaccurate information by his counsel and the

prosecution. Id. Finally, Mom suggests that his sentence was

illegally        imposed    on   him    and       that   this    Court    was   without

jurisdiction to impose a sentence of 63 months on him. Id. at Page

5 of 6.

       Although Mom challenges his conviction and sentence on four

different grounds, the gravamen of his arguments with respect to

each of those grounds is directed at Mom’s disagreement with the

calculation of his criminal history. Specifically, Mom maintains

that his three prior drug convictions in Rhode Island state court

were       for   misdemeanor     possession         to   which    he     pleaded   nolo

contendere. Id. at Pages 4-5 of 6. Thus, Mom argues that (1) he did

not have the qualifying offenses to be adjudged a felon, precluding

his conviction of being a felon in possession of a firearm, and (2)

the state convictions could not be used to compute his significant

criminal history category.

       In response, the government submitted documentation - which

have not been challenged by Mom - related to the three convictions4

that       served   to     qualify     Mom    as    a    felon   and     that   weighed



       4

     The Court notes that Mom had an extensive criminal history
which included numerous convictions for a variety of offenses in
addition to the three felonies at issue.

                                              6
Case 1:11-cr-00019-ML-PAS Document 37 Filed 06/04/13 Page 7 of 11 PageID #: 161



significantly in calculating Mom’s criminal history category:

        (1) In 2004, Mom pleaded nolo contendere in Rhode Island

state court to manufacture, delivery and possession of a Schedule

I/II controlled substance, and to possession of marijuana. Mom was

sentenced to six years’ imprisonment, with three months to serve

and 69 months suspended with 69 months’ probation for the former,

and one year suspended with one year probation for the latter.

Judgment of Conviction and Commitment (Docket # 31-1 at Pages 1-2

of 4) and Request to enter plea of nolo contendere or guilty. Id.

at Page 4 of 4. In 2008, Mom admitted to having violated the terms

of his probation, for which the suspension was removed and Mom was

sentenced to 69 months’ imprisonment, six months to serve, 63

months suspended with 63 months’ probation. Judgment of Conviction

and Commitment. Id. at Page 3 of 4.

      (2) In 2008, Mom pleaded nolo contendere in Rhode Island state

court to possession of a Schedule I-V controlled substance, for

which he was sentenced to 36 months’ imprisonment, six months to

serve, 30 months suspended with 36 months’ probation. Judgment of

Conviction and Commitment (Docket # 31-2, Pages 1-2 of 3), request

to enter plea of nolo contendere or guilty. Id. at Page 3 of 3.

      (3) In 2009, Mom pleaded nolo contendere in Rhode Island state

court to possession of a Schedule I-V controlled substance, for

which he was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment, nine months to

serve, 63 months suspended with 63 months’ probation. Judgment of


                                      7
Case 1:11-cr-00019-ML-PAS Document 37 Filed 06/04/13 Page 8 of 11 PageID #: 162



Conviction and Commitment (Docket # 31-2, Pages 1,2 of 3), Request

to enter plea of nolo contendere or guilty. Id. at Page 3 of 3.

      In his §2255 motion, Mom appears to challenge his status as a

felon    because     (1)   he   pleaded        nolo   contendere   to   the   three

convictions at issue, and (2) he served less than one year on each

of those convictions. Neither of those arguments carry any weight.

      First, pursuant to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, a

prior sentence constitutes a predicate conviction for purposes of

computing a defendants’ criminal history if the sentence was

previously imposed upon adjudication of guilt “whether by guilty

plea, trial, or plea of nolo contendere, for conduct not part of

the instant offense.” 2011 U.S.S.G. §4A1.2(a)(1) (emphasis in

original); United States v. Cadavid, 192 F.3d 230, 238-239 (1st

Cir. 1999). This determination is consistent with § 12-18-3 of the

Rhode Island General Laws, which provides that a plea of nolo

contendere of “any person who is sentenced to serve a term in the

adult correctional institutions or who is given a suspended or

deferred sentence in addition to probation,” is considered a

conviction. R.I. Gen. Laws § 12-18-3(b)(1982); United States v.

Patrone, 948 F.2d 813, 817 (1st Cir. 1991)(concluding that “a nolo

contendere    plea    followed    by   a       sentence   of imprisonment     or a

suspended sentence constitutes a conviction.”).

      Second, for the purpose of computing a defendant’s criminal

history, a “felony” is defined as “any federal, state, or local


                                           8
Case 1:11-cr-00019-ML-PAS Document 37 Filed 06/04/13 Page 9 of 11 PageID #: 163



offense punishable by death or a term of imprisonment exceeding one

year, regardless of the actual sentence imposed.” 2011 U.S.S.G.

§4A1.2(o)(emphasis added); United States v. Almenas, 553 F.3d 27

(1st Cir. 2009)(rejecting defendant’s argument that offense - which

carried a punishment of up to two and one-half years’ incarceration

- did not qualify as a felony because it was categorized as a

misdemeanor under state law and where the defendant was only

required to pay a fine).

      Under Rhode Island law, “any criminal offense which at any

given time may be punished by imprisonment for a term of more than

one year, or by a fine of more than one thousand dollars ($1,000),

is   declared     to    be    a     felony;...”      R.I.    Gen.   Laws    §   11-1-2

(1985)(emphasis added). Accordingly, an offense which is punishable

by more than one year of imprisonment constitutes a predicate

felony    offense      for    the   purpose     of   calculating      a    defendant’s

sentence, regardless whether a part or all of the sentence has been

suspended.      State    v.    Burke,     811     A.2d      1158,   1168-1169    (R.I.

2002)(noting the United States Supreme Court’s conclusion that

“‘[a] suspended sentence is a prison term imposed for the offense

of conviction. Once the prison term is triggered [by a probation

violation], the defendant is incarcerated not for the probation

violation, but for the underlying offense.’” (quoting Alabama v.

Shelton, 535 U.S. 654, 654, 122 S.Ct. 1764, 1770, 152 L.Ed.2d 888,

898 (2002)).


                                           9
Case 1:11-cr-00019-ML-PAS Document 37 Filed 06/04/13 Page 10 of 11 PageID #: 164



       In sum, it is undisputable that Mom was previously convicted

 in Rhode Island state court for three separate offenses for which

 sentences of incarceration of more than one year could be imposed.

 Neither the fact that Mom pleaded nolo contendere to those offenses

 nor that he was required to serve less than one year on each

 offense     with     the    remainders       suspended,        change         the    felony

 categorization of those offenses. As such, each of those three

 convictions    could       serve    to   qualify    Mom       as   a    felon       who   was

 prohibited from possessing firearms and all three convictions were

 appropriately included in the computation of Mom’s criminal history

 category.

       With respect to the additional arguments that Mom has raised

 in   his   amended    §2255       petition    (Docket     #    32),     the    Court      has

 considered those arguments and finds them to be without merit.

       V.    Conclusion

       For all of the foregoing reasons, Mom’s motion to vacate, set

 aside, or correct his sentence is DENIED and DISMISSED.

                    Ruling on Certificate of Appealability

       Pursuant      to     Rule    11(a)     of   the   Rules          Governing      §2255

 Proceedings for the United States District Courts, this Court

 hereby finds that this case is not appropriate for the issuance of

 a certificate of appealability because Mom has failed to make “a

 substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right” as to

 any claim, as required by 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).

Case 1:11-cr-00019-ML-PAS Document 37 Filed 06/04/13 Page 11 of 11 PageID #: 165



       Mom is advised that any motion to reconsider this ruling will

 not extend the time to file a notice of appeal in this matter.           See

 Rules Governing § 2255 Cases, Rule 11(a).
