               ASSENTED-TO MOTION TO EXCLUDE TIME UNDER
                           SPEEDY TRIAL ACT


     The United States respectfully moves that this Court exclude

from the calculation of the time within which the defendant must

be brought to trial under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161,

et seq. (“STA”), the period between November 30, 2005 and the

status conference currently set for April 27, 2006.          As grounds

therefor, the United States states that, in order for the

defendant to make an informed decision regarding the disposition

of this matter, he needs to determine whether he qualifies as an

armed career criminal for purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 924(e).            The

Unites States further states that, in the wake of Shepard v.

United States, 544 U.S. 13 (2005), the parties have been

attempting to, but have not been able to, make this

determination.    In this connection, the Court has allowed the

defendant’s motion for a pre-plea presentence report, which the

parties anticipate will provide needed guidance in this regard.

In light of the importance of this issue to the defendant’s
   Case 1:04-cr-10227-RWZ   Document 37   Filed 04/12/2006   Page 2 of 2



potential sentence, the United States submits that, consistent

with 18 U.S.C. §3161(h)(8)(A), the ends of justice served by

continuing the matter from November 30, 2005 to April 25, 2006 in

connection with the parties’ efforts to determine the defendant’s

criminal history outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial.

     The defendant, through his counsel, has assented to the

exclusion of said period for purposes of the STA.

                                  Respectfully submitted,

                                  MICHAEL J. SULLIVAN
