GORTON, J.

     In this criminal case the defendant, Moises Cintron

(“Cintron”), is charged with one count of being a felon in

possession of a firearm and ammunition.       He has moved to

suppress, inter alia, statements made to members of law

enforcement following his arrest on the ground that they were not

made pursuant to a knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of

Miranda rights.   This Court convened an evidentiary hearing on

January 30, 2009, to address the limited issue of whether

Cintron’s voluntary intoxication had any material effect on the

validity of his Miranda waiver.

I.   Background

     A.   Findings of Fact

     Cintron was arrested on the morning of November 7, 2007,

during the course of a vehicle stop on Route 128 in Lynnfield,

Massachusetts, after police observed a gun protruding from his

                                  -1-

pocket.   The facts surrounding that vehicle stop are recounted in

detail in this Court’s December 15, 2008, Memorandum and Order

(“the December 15 M&O”), in which the Court denied most aspects

of Cintron’s motion to suppress.

     Following his arrest, Cintron was placed in the back of a

police cruiser by Massachusetts State Police Trooper Stevie

Browning (“Browning”).    Browning subsequently informed Cintron of

his Miranda rights and transported him to the police barracks in

Danvers, Massachusetts.    Upon arrival, Browning took Cintron to

the “booking” area and re-advised him of his Miranda rights.          At

that time Cintron indicated that he understood those rights.

     Cintron proceeded to tell Trooper Browning (untruthfully)

that his name was Elizear Caceras (“Caceras”).        He also provided

Browning with what turned out to be the correct date of birth and

social security number of that individual.       At that time Cintron

also stated that he had purchased the firearm found in his

possession for $200.    During his interview with Trooper Browning,

Cintron was relaxed and cooperative.      Although he appeared tired

and lethargic, he was not confused and was responsive to

Browning’s questions.

     Cintron was subsequently questioned by Officer Scott Frost,

a member of the Danvers Police Department.       At that time Officer

Frost was a Drug Recognition Expert who specialized in

recognizing the physical characteristics of a person under the


                                  -2-

influence of either drugs or alcohol.          During questioning by

Frost, Cintron admitted to snorting a line of heroin earlier that

morning and Frost observed a number of characteristics that he

considered consistent with heroin use.          During the interview

Cintron repeatedly fell asleep between questions and fell back

against the wall or to the side.         Cintron also had difficulty

keeping his eyes open and his speech was slurred.            According to

Frost, Cintron physically appeared “out of it.”

     Despite exhibiting signs of heroin use, Cintron was

cooperative and responsive throughout most of his interview with

Frost.    Toward the end, however, when Frost sought to administer

physical tests, Cintron refused to cooperate and indicated that

he just wanted to sleep.

     Later that afternoon Cintron was interviewed by Special

Agent Michael Turner (“Turner”) of the Bureau of Alcohol,

Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (“the ATF”).           Turner began the

interview by again informing Cintron of his Miranda rights and

obtaining a signed waiver.        The signature line on the waiver form

begins with the letter M followed by the name Elizear Caceras.

     Upon questioning by Turner, Cintron admitted his real name

and also stated that he purchased the firearm for $250 from a man

in Brockton.     Cintron also asked Turner “What can you do for me?”

in an apparent effort to negotiate a deal.          Turner observed that

Cintron appeared tired and nodded off at times during the


                                     -3-

interview but that he responded appropriately to the questions

asked and did not need to have questions repeated.

      Evidence of Cintron’s criminal history was also introduced

at the evidentiary hearing.      That evidence reflects that, since

1990, Cintron has been arraigned on 64 charges as an adult and 19

as a juvenile.

      B.   Procedural History

      Cintron was indicted on December 19, 2007 and filed the

pending motion to suppress on July 17, 2008.         This Court denied

most of that motion on December 15, 2008, but concluded that an

evidentiary hearing was necessary to determine the validity of

Cintron’s Miranda waiver.      That evidentiary hearing was held on

January 30, 2009, and supplemental briefing was subsequently

submitted by both parties.

II.   Analysis

      A.   Legal Standard

      This Court begins “with the presumption that the defendant

did not waive his [Miranda] rights” and “the government bears the

burden of proving a valid waiver by a preponderance of the

evidence.”    United States v. Downs-Moses, 329 F.3d 253, 267 (1st

Cir. 2003).      To be valid, a defendant’s waiver of Miranda rights

must be made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.          Miranda

v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 444 (1966).        According to the First

Circuit Court of Appeals:


                                   -4-
      Case 1:07-cr-10435-NMG Document 35 Filed 04/01/09 Page 5 of 8



     Determining the validity of a Miranda waiver usually
     entails two separate inquiries. The waiver must be
     both voluntary, and knowing and intelligent.

United States v. Baezanson-Perkins, 390 F.3d 34, 39 (1st

Cir. 2004) (citing Moran v. Burbine, 475 U.S. 412, 421

(1986)).

     A waiver is voluntary if it is “the product of a free

and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or

deception.”    Id. (quoting Moran, 475 U.S. at 421).       Because

there is no suggestion that “police resorted to physical or

psychological pressure” here, the voluntariness of Cintron’s

statements is not an issue.     See Moran, 475 U.S. at 421.

     To be knowing and intelligent a waiver “must have been

made with a full awareness both of the nature of the right

being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to

abandon it.”    Baezanson-Perkins, 390 F.3d at 39 (quoting

Moran, 475 U.S. at 421).    Courts must look to the totality

of the circumstances to determine whether a defendant had

the “requisite level of comprehension” to waive his

Miranda rights.    Moran, 475 U.S. at 421.     Such circumstances

include “the tactics used by the police, the details of the

interrogation, and any characteristics of the accused that

might cause his will easily to be overborne.”        United States

v. Palmer, 203 F.3d 55, 60 (1st Cir. 2000).

     B.    Application

     In light of the totality of the circumstances, this

Court concludes that Cintron’s intoxication was not so

severe as to invalidate his waiver of Miranda rights.         This

Court has considered, on the one hand, the fact that Cintron

was impaired by his use of heroin and, thus, in a condition

where his will might have been more easily overborne.         See

Palmer, 203 F.3d at 60.    His inability to stay awake,

slurred speech and lack of balance and coordination cause

concern.   Nevertheless, those facts do not alone demonstrate

that Cintron’s waiver was made without full awareness of the

consequences.   See id. at 61-62 (waiver valid despite the

fact that defendant was suffering from heroin withdrawal and

under the influence of an anti-depressant).        Moreover, other

circumstances surrounding Cintron’s interrogation reveal

that he did possess the “requisite level of comprehension”

to waive his Miranda rights.     See Moran, 475 U.S. at 421.

     First, despite being under the influence of drugs,

Cintron had the presence of mind to provide officers with a

false name along with an accurate date of birth and social

security number for the alias he had assumed.        The ability

to recite accurately the name, date of birth and social

security number of an assumed identity demonstrates a high

degree of mental acuity and an awareness of what was going


                               -6-
       Case 1:07-cr-10435-NMG Document 35 Filed 04/01/09 Page 7 of 8



on.

      Second, Cintron’s response to questions during his

interrogations indicate that at no time was his will

overborne.    During his interview with Officer Frost, Cintron

decided at which point he no longer wanted to cooperate and

at that time asked to be left alone so he could sleep.

Cintron also attempted to negotiate a deal with Agent

Turner, strongly suggesting that he understood his right to

answer, or not answer, questions as he saw fit.         See United

States v. Depina, No. 06-cv-10337, 2007 WL 2572436, at *3

(D. Mass. Sept. 7, 2007) (noting that refusal to answer

certain questions suggests that suspect’s will was not

overborne).

      Finally, the government has produced evidence of

Cintron’s lengthy criminal history, which includes

arraignments for well over 50 offenses in the past 20 years.

As a “veteran of the criminal justice system” Cintron was

likely well aware of his Miranda rights and the consequences

of his decision to waive them.        See id.

      The Court also rejects the defendant’s assertion that

the testimony elicited at the evidentiary hearing failed to

establish that Trooper Browning read Cintron his Miranda

rights simply because the witness did not specifically

recite what those rights were.        The thrust of Browning’s


                                -7-
      Case 1:07-cr-10435-NMG Document 35 Filed 04/01/09 Page 8 of 8



testimony was that Cintron understood his Miranda rights and

that testimony was not refuted by the defendant or any other

evidence before the Court.     This Court concludes that

Cintron validly waived his Miranda rights and therefore his

motion to suppress will be denied.



                              ORDER

     In accordance with the foregoing, the defendant’s

motion to suppress (Docket No. 15) is DENIED.
