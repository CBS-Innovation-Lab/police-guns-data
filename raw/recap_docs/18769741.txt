                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                       DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

             v.                              Case No. 05-cr-184-01-SM

Theoun So

                                    ORDER

      Defendant So’s motion to continue the final pretrial conference and trial is

granted (document 17). Trial has been rescheduled for the June 2006 trial

period. Defendant So shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights not later than

March 31, 2006. On the filing of such waiver, his continuance shall be

effective.

      The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18

U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would

unreasonably deny defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances.

      Final Pretrial Conference: June 13, 2006 at 1:30 p.m.

      Jury Selection: June 20, 2006 at 9:30 a.m.
