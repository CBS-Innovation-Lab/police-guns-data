UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
v. NO. 03-CR-30044-MAP
GARRETT GORDON,
Defendant

MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
RE: GOVERNMENT’S MOTIONS
FOR EXCLUDABLE DELAY
(Docket Nos. 42 & 46)
December 28, 2005
PONSOR, D.J.

I. INTRODUCTION

 

Defendant was indicted on November 6, 2003 for being a
felon in possession of a firearm, for possessing cocaine base
with the intention of distributing it, and for possessing a
firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense.
Because of his prior record, he faces a probable ndnimum
mandatory twenty-year sentence if convicted.

As the chronology set forth below will demonstrate, this
case has taken an unusually long time to reach trial. Before
the court now are the two motions by the government to exclude

relatively' modest; periods of time from the Speedy Trial

Case 3:03-cr-30044-I\/|AP Document 71 Filed 12/28/05 Page 2 of 14

calculation, pursuant. to 18 ‘U.S.C. § 3161(h). Defendant,
through recently appointed counsel, has opposed thesezmotions.
The government’s lack of diligence in providing appropriate
discovery, Defendant argues, may well be found, after hearing,
to make allowance of the requested exclusions improper under
18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(C). Despite Defendant’s opposition,
the government’s motions were allowed on December 19, 2005;
this memorandum will set forth the court’s reasoning.
II. PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND

Following Defendant’s indictment on November 6, 2003,
this case was superintended by Magistrate Judge Kenneth P.
Neiman through June 25, 2004, when Judge Neiman issued his
Interim Scheduling Order and Final Status Report. The order
established July 23, 2004 as the date for Defendant to file
his Motion to Suppress, August 13, 2004 for the government’s
opposition, and September 9, 2004 for a final pretrial
conference. Judge Neiman's order confirmed that, as of
September 9, 2004, ng time had run from the statutory seventy-
day Speedy Trial clock.

Despite Magistrate Judge Neiman’s order, defense counsel

Jonathan R. Elliott, Sr. (predecessor to Defendant’s current

Case 3:03-cr-30044-I\/|AP Document 71 Filed 12/28/05 Page 3 of 14

counsel) neglected to file any motion to suppress and,
instead, filed a Motion for Additional Time to file the
suppression motion on September 9, 2004, the date of the
pretrial conference. The papers suggest that the delay may
have been related, in part, to Defendant’s attempts to
cooperate with the government.

On September 9, 2004, the court established a second
schedule for filing a motion to suppress. Defense counsel was
to submit the motion by October 8, 2004, opposition was to be
filed by October 29, 2004, and a hearing was scheduled for
December 13, 2004. An order issued excluding time from the
Speedy Trial clock from September 9, 2004 to October 8, 2004
to permit counsel time to prepare the motion.

Once again, Attorney Elliott failed to file any motion to
suppress in response to the court's order. Finally, on
December 14, 2004, the suppression motion was filed and duly
opposed on January 24, 2005. Recognizing that the time had
been used by defense counsel to prepare the motion, the court
issued an order excluding the period between October 8, 2004
and January 19, 2005 from the Speedy Trial calculation.

Evidentiary hearings followed on the suppression motion on

Case 3:03-cr-30044-I\/|AP Document 71 Filed 12/28/05 Page 4 of 14

February 16, March ll, and March 14, 2005. At the conclusion
of the hearings, the court denied the motion from the bench.
The court then set a trial date of June 27, 2005. A motion to
exclude the time from March 14 to June 27, based on the
interests of justice, was allowed on April 20, 2005 on the
ground that counsel had needed time for negotiations regarding
a possible plea, and, further, on the need to establish a
reasonably convenient trial date that would permit continuity
of counsel. Thus, no days were deductible from the Speedy
Trial clock from the date of Defendant's indictment up to the
first date established for his trial on June 27, 2005.

Defendant’s trial was thereafter continued to July 5,
2005 to accommodate a government witness who would be out of
the area due to a medical emergency for his wife. That period
is hereby excluded pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(3)(A). On
June 23, 2005 the trial was continued a second time to August
8.

Because of occasional references to cooperation by
Defendant and a possible plea, and because of defense
counsel's failure previously to comply with court orders for

filing motions, the court requested the Magistrate Judge to

Case 3:03-cr-30044-I\/|AP Document 71 Filed 12/28/05 Page 5 of 14

conduct a status conference on August 1, 2005 to confirm that
the case would definitely be going to trial on August 8, 2005.
This conference was held, counsel appeared, and the certainty
of trial was confirmed.

On August 3, 2005, the government conveyed to defense
counsel information regarding an inculpatory intercepted phone
conversation between Defendant and one Raymond Shaver. The
evidence regarding the conversation had been maintained in a
file related to Shaver, who was also the subject of an
investigation and of criminal charges both in federal and
state courts, and was not discovered by government counsel in
this case until shortly before trial. Although the government
had not listed Raymond Shaver on the witness list submitted in
preparation for the Gordon trial, government counsel
apparently considered disclosure proper since the interception
contained Defendant’s voice.

Attorney Elliott, counsel for Gordon, has also
represented Shaver on pending federal and state court criminal
charges. On August 4, 2005, Attorney Elliott. moved to
withdraw his appearance, based upon the argument that Shaver’s

possible appearance in the Gordon trial would create a

Case 3:03-cr-30044-I\/|AP Document 71 Filed 12/28/05 Page 6 of 14

conflict for him.l

When counsel gathered on August 8, 2005 to commence the
scheduled trial, the court pronounced.itself “a little puzzled
about the exact basis for the motion to withdraw.” (Dkt. No.
58, Tr. Hr’g 2.) The court pointed out that it did not appear
that Shaver was even going to be a witness in the Gordon
trial, and therefore the court did not “understand what the
problem is here.” (lc_i4 at 3.)

In response to inquiries, counsel for the government
indicated that, despite the absence of Shaver from its witness
list, the government migh§ consider calling him either in its
case-in-chief, or as a rebuttal witness. If this should
happen, the fact that counsel for Defendant had also
represented Shaver would create a problem.

Nevertheless, the court continued to press counsel, since
an obvious solution to the problem existed. The court could
simply proceed to trial and bar the government from calling

Shaver, based upon the failure to include him in its list of

 

lDefendant's current counsel also points to some other
late-supplied discovery, but this discovery did not play any
role in the filing of prior counsel’s Motion to Withdraw and
thus is irrelevant to consideration of the Speedy Trial issues
now before the court.

Case 3:03-cr-30044-I\/|AP Document 71 Filed 12/28/05 Page 7 of 14

witnesses and upon its failure to disclose the evidence of the
conversation between Shaver and Defendant until shortly before
trial. In retrospect, this simple approach probably should
have been followed by the court.

The court did not follow this approach because of the
extremely harsh, practical consequences that would have
resulted from proceeding to trial at that time -- upon both
Defendant in this case, Garrett Gordon, and upon the potential
witness,. Raymond Shaver. An understanding of this consequence
requires some background on two points.

First, prior to this trial date, Raymond Shaver, indicted
in a separate proceeding and represented by Attorney Elliott,
had pled guilty before me to charges that carried a mandatory
minimum sentence of life imprisonment. Shaver’ s appearance in
the Gordon trial, and a motion from the government confirming
his substantial assistance, might have been the only way
Shaver could avoid a lifetime in prison. By barring the
government from calling Shaver in this case, and proceeding to
trial, the court would have eliminated that possibility.

Second, if convicted, Gordon himself faced a likely

mandatory sentence of twenty years. Again, plea negotiations

Case 3:03-cr-30044-I\/|AP Document 71 Filed 12/28/05 Page 8 of 14

recognizing substantial assistance might result in a lower
sentence. Indeed, counsel for the government stated that
Gordon “is much closer to a plea, which we would accept at the
eleventh hour if the court would accept. But the concern I
have again is the finality of that plea if it were going to
take place with what we’ve spoken about today with Mr. Shaver
being a potential witness.” (lg¢ at 15-16.) In other words,
given the conflicts presented by Mr. Elliott’s simultaneous
representation of Shaver and Gordon, and Gordon’s knowledge of
that representation, any plea he might offer, even if it
benefitted him, would be vulnerable to attack later on the
ground that he felt pressured to plead due to his attorney's
simultaneous representation of a potential witness against
him.

Confronted with this confusing situation, the court
(regrettably in retrospect) made the determination to allow
the motion of Attorney Elliott to withdraw, with the result
that the trial had to be continued to accommodate new counsel.
The purpose of the court's ruling was to allow both Shaver and
Gordon to negotiate, while represented by conflict-free

counsel, with the government in an effort to perhaps palliate

Case 3:03-cr-30044-I\/|AP Document 71 Filed 12/28/05 Page 9 of 14

the extraordinarily severe sentences they were facing.

On September 6, 2005, the government filed the first of
the two motions now before the court, seeking to exclude the
period of August 8 to September 9, 2005 from the Speedy Trial
calculations, on the ground that the period was needed for
appointment of new counsel. (§§g Dkt. No. 42.) On September
9, counsel for the government filed the second motion, seeking
an exclusion of the period from September 9 to October 27,
2005 on the ground that new counsel would need the time for
trial preparation. (§gg Dkt. No. 46.) 18 U.S.C. §
3161(8)(B)(iv) allows the court to permit an exclusion from
the Speedy Trial calculation, on the ground that it serves the
ends of justice, where a continuance is necessary to give a
defendant “reasonable time to obtain counsel” and “reasonable
time necessary for effective preparation.”

The filing by the government of the motions on September
6 and 9, 2005 served to stop the Speedy Trial clock pending
hearing on the motion followed by a thirty-day advisement
period, once the court had received all materials necessary to
render a decision. §§g 18 U.S.C. §§ 3161(h)(l)(F) and (J).

As noted, new counsel for Defendant has opposed these two

Case 3:03-cr-30044-I\/|AP Document 71 Filed 12/28/05 Page 10 of 14

motions and objected to any further exclusions from the Speedy
Trial clock, even those periods of time that might be
necessary for him to prepare for trial or plea in this case.
Defense counsel argues that Attorney Elliott's Motion to
Withdraw was precipitated by the government's late disclosure
of the evidence of the inculpatory conversation.between Shaver
and Gordon to Elliott. If the evidence relating to Shaver had
been disclosed in a timely fashion, the argument runs,
Attorney Elliott would have become aware of the conflict
earlier and either would have withdrawn his representation of
Shaver, or would have filed his motion to withdraw from this
case much sooner.

Defense counsel contends that, before the court rules on
the government’s motions to exclude, it must permit defense
counsel to take discovery and hold an evidentiary hearing on
the degree of diligence exhibited by government counsel in
attempting to obtain the evidence of the Shaver/Gordon
conversation and provide it in a timely fashion to defense
counsel. 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(C) forbids exclusions from
the Speedy Trial clock arising from continuances caused by

“lack of diligent preparation . . . on the part of the

10

Case 3:03-cr-30044-I\/|AP Document 71 Filed 12/28/05 Page 11 of 14

attorney for the government.”

In response to the defense opposition, the government
contends that the record is sufficient, without discovery or
any evidentiary proceeding, to permit the court to conclude
that the government was diligent in discovering and providing
the information regarding the Shaver/Gordon conversation prior
to trial.

III. DISCUSSION

 

Both the government and defense arguments land somewhat
to the side of the point. The government's diligence, or lack
thereof, in locating the evidence of the conversation between
Shaver and Gordon is irrelevant. The court was prepared to
deny Attorney Elliott's Motion to Withdraw and take the case
to trial on August 8, 2005, barring the government from
putting on any testimony from Raymond Shaver. Thus, the late
disclosure of the discovery regarding Shaver would have had no
impact on the trial whatsoever and would not have prejudiced
Defendant in any way.

The decision to allow Attorney Elliott to withdraw, and
the resultingl expenditure of time while new counsel was

appointed and prepared for trial, was the responsibility of

11

Case 3:03-cr-30044-I\/|AP Document 71 Filed 12/28/05 Page 12 of 14

this court and was made in the interests of justice to protect
the rights of two defendants facing very long prison
sentences. Each defendant, it appeared, was interested in
possibly cooperating, but both had been represented by the
same attorney. Out of concern for both Gordon and Shaver, the
court took the responsibility to insure that they were both
adequately advised by independent and conflict-free counsel
before pressing Gordon to trial. These circumstances
presented precisely a situation where failure to grant a
continuance might have resulted in a “miscarriage of justice"

-- i.e., a sentence for one or both of the defendants far

 

longer than might otherwise be sought by the government.
Avoiding such a miscarriage is recognized as a ground for
excluding time from the Speedy Trial calculation. §g§ 18
U.S.C. § 3161 (h) (8) (B) (i) .

Apart from the practicalities faced by the court on
August 8, 2005, exclusion is justified by the straightforward
circumstances underlying the government's current motions.
The period from August 8 to August 23, 2005 must be excluded
because Defendant simply had no attorney during that time.

Attorney Elliott had withdrawn and current counsel had.not.yet

12

Case 3:03-cr-30044-I\/|AP Document 71 Filed 12/28/05 Page 13 of 14

filed his appearance, Moreover, the period from August 23 to
September 6 must be excluded as time needed by counsel to
prepare the case. Indeed, counsel frankly admits that, even
as of the date of this memorandum, he will need more time to
adequately prepare for trial. (§§g Dkt. No. 67, Emergency Mot.
to Continue Jan. 3, 2006 Trial Date.)2 The time from
September 6, 2005 to the date of this memorandum has been
excluded as necessary to receive memoranda, hear argument, and
obtain transcripts necessary to rule on the government's
September 6 and 9 motions. §§g 18 U.S.C. §§ 3161(h)(l)(F) and
(J).

The only non-excluded dates from the Speedy Trial clock
are the thirty days from July 5 until August 4, 2005, the date
when Attorney Elliott’s Motion to Withdraw was filed. Thus,
forty days remained on the Speedy Trial clock as of the
court's ruling on the government's motions on December 19,
2005.

Following the court's ruling on December 19, the clerk

 

2Defense counsel’s arguments are ironic, but not flatly
inconsistent. He contends that no new counsel would have been
needed, and thus no extra time for preparation required,r if
the government had made timely disclosure of the discovery
evidencing the conflict to Attorney Elliott.

13

Case 3:03-cr-30044-I\/|AP Document 71 Filed 12/28/05 Page 14 of 14

was ordered to contact counsel and inform them that trial
would commence on January 3, 2006, a date well within the
period remaining under the Speedy Trial Act. In response,
defense counsel filed his Emergency'Mbtion to Continue, Docket
No. 67, which was heard and allowed on December 23, 2005. The
basis for the motion was, as noted above, counsel’s
understandable need for time to prepare. Trial is now set for
February 6, 2006, a date still well within the Speedy Trial
clock. To keep the record clear, however, the court has
ordered the government to submit, with defendant’s assent, a
motion to exclude the time between December 23, 2005 and
February 6, 2006, from the Speedy Trial calculation.
It is So Ordered.
