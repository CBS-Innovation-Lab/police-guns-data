                        MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
                         September 11, 2008
     Defendant James Werra has been charged in a one-count

indictment with possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C.

§ 922(g)(1).   He seeks to suppress the firearm seized during a

search of his person conducted by the Brockton Police on November

10, 2006.   For the reasons discussed below, I will deny the

motion to suppress.   Because the facts and circumstances

presented by the motion offer the potential for multiple branches

to the decision tree, however, I also address related disputes

whose resolution may become the predicate for an alternative

analysis or disposition of the motion to suppress.

                         I. FINDINGS OF FACT

     A.     The Background

     On November 10, 2006, at approximately 10:00 a.m., Brockton

Police Detective Michael Schaaf was driving with Massachusetts

State Trooper Robert Fries in Brockton.        The two were taking

                                   1
        Case 1:06-cr-10414-DPW Document 34 Filed 09/11/08 Page 2 of 28


part in an initiative to arrest people for whom arrest warrants

had been issued.      One person with an arrest warrant outstanding

for whom Schaaf and Fries were looking was Jeanine Daley.            Schaaf

and Fries received information from “Christine,” an informant,

that Daley was staying at 63 Menlo Street and that Christine had

seen Daley there recently.       Christine had provided Schaaf with

reliable information concerning the location of a suspect in the

past.    Schaaf and Fries proceeded to drive to 63 Menlo Street.

        B.   The 63 Menlo Street Residence

        Menlo Street is located in a residential neighborhood.           The

lease to 63 Menlo Street was in the name of Jeffrey Cicerano and

he paid most of the $3000 monthly rent.         Cicerano had his own

bedroom on the first floor, and he maintained control over the

adjacent living room.      There was also a kitchen on the first

floor where other residents would sometimes congregate.            No door

separated the kitchen from the entrance foyer.

        The defendant, James Werra, paid Cicerano to rent the third

floor, which had a bedroom, a kitchenette and a bathroom.

Werra’s girlfriend and her child had previously lived there with

Werra but moved out before November 10.         The third floor was

Werra’s personal space and he had the ability to keep people out

of that part of the building.        In addition to renting the third

floor, Werra sometimes - "not a lot but once in a while,"

according to Cicerano - slept on the couch in the living room on

the first floor, with Cicerano's permission, because people would

“party” on the third floor.

                                      2
            Case 1:06-cr-10414-DPW Document 34 Filed 09/11/08 Page 3 of 28



        Other people also lived at the address and contributed money

for rent.        Mika (or "Miko") Brown and Jeanine Daley paid Cicerano

to live on the first floor.           A person named Paul, whose last name

Cicerano could not remember, rented a room on the second floor.

Additionally, the defendant's brother, Mikey Werra, and his

girlfriend had lived in the house and contributed rent at some

point, but they had moved out before November 10.

        C.      The Officers Enter 63 Menlo Street1

        Upon arriving at 63 Menlo Street, Schaaf and Fries

approached the front door and knocked.             Cicerano answered the

door.        Schaaf and Cicerano knew each other from Cicerano’s past

encounters with law enforcement.              Specifically, Schaaf had

previously arrested Cicerano on an outstanding warrant.                Before

arriving, Schaaf believed 63 Menlo Street to be a “rooming house”

operated as a sober house, but after seeing Cicerano he became

concerned that 63 Menlo Street had become a drug house.

        Standing outside the door, Schaaf asked Cicerano if he could

talk to him.         He also told Cicerano that he wanted to talk to the

people in the house about drug activity.              Cicerano asked Schaaf



        1
      As will be apparent from the findings of fact in this
section, I largely credit the testimony of Cicerano over that of
the officers concerning the circumstances of the officers' entry
of 63 Menlo Street. Without detailing at length the reasons for
making this credibility determination, it will suffice to observe
that given his personal circumstances and disposition, Cicerano
does not appear to me as likely to have consented voluntarily to
the entry by the officers.

                                          3
         Case 1:06-cr-10414-DPW Document 34 Filed 09/11/08 Page 4 of 28



if he had a warrant.       Schaaf said that he did not and asked if he

needed one.2     Cicerano told them he did.       Cicerano began to walk

away from the front door but turned around when the police

started kicking the bottom of the door.          Cicerano asked them what

they were doing.       In response, Schaaf threatened to “close the

house down.”      At that point, Cicerano told Schaaf and Fries that

he would come outside to talk, and they agreed.            When Cicerano

opened the door, however, Schaaf pushed the door open further and

forced his way into the entry foyer.          Cicerano told him he had to

leave.     Schaaf responded that they just wanted to talk, but

Cicerano repeated that the officers had to leave.            Schaaf then

instructed Cicerano to get everyone who was on the second and

third floor of the apartment and bring them downstairs.             Cicerano

went upstairs.




     2
      Given the arrest warrant for Jeanine Daley the officers
were undertaking to execute, it may at first blush appear odd
that Schaaf would not announce he had a warrant in response to
Cicerano's question. But concerns about flight by Daley would
arguably justify a less than candid response by Schaaf. The
government, during argument on their suppression motion, appeared
to offer an ambivalent response to my question whether it was
“contend[ing] that the arrest warrant is sufficient to justify
entering the household." The Assistant United States Attorney
said: "I don't think the officers had enough information about
the presence of Jeanine Daley in there to rely on the arrest
warrant. I think it was a sufficient basis for the[ir] being in
the building and seeking to find her there." Irrespective of the
Government's ambivalence, as will appear below, see infra Section
II.B.1, I find that the warrant did indeed authorize the
officers' entry.

     D.      The Search And Arrest Of Werra3

     Initially, Schaaf remained in the foyer on the first floor

of 63 Menlo Street, while Cicerano went upstairs.            Schaaf looked

through a set of pocket doors, which were open enough for him to

poke his head through, and he observed Werra in the living room

area adjacent to Cicerano's bedroom.          Werra was wearing a

t-shirt, a pair of baggy shorts, and sneakers.            Fries also looked

into the living room.

     The officers saw Werra sitting on a couch and “just sort of

staring out into space” in the living room.           Neither Schaaf nor

Fries knew who Werra was or that he had an outstanding arrest

warrant.     Schaaf asked Werra, “Hey, buddy, are you all right?

What’s going on?”       Werra did not respond.      At that point, Schaaf

heard noise in the foyer and turned from the living room.             Schaaf

saw two individuals enter the foyer from a bedroom on the

opposite side of the first floor and another individual enter the

foyer from the kitchen on the first floor.

     After returning his attention to the foyer, Schaaf saw

movement out of the corner of his eye.          Schaaf turned and saw

Werra walking out of the living room towards him.            Werra’s hands



     3
       As will become apparent from the findings of fact in this
section, I largely credit the testimony of the police officers
over that of Werra concerning their search and arrest of Werra.
To the degree that Werra may be said to have an adequate
recollection of the events, I find his testimony to be lacking in
credibility.

                                       5
         Case 1:06-cr-10414-DPW Document 34 Filed 09/11/08 Page 6 of 28



were in his front pant pockets, “half in half out” and “moving

slightly.”      Schaaf observed that Werra had the clip of a

concealed pocket knife visible outside his front right pocket.

Without telling Werra to remove his hands from his pockets,

Schaaf reached and took the knife from Werra's pocket.             Observing

that Werra still had his left hand in his front pocket and “was

moving a little bit,” Schaaf “was not sure if there was another

knife in the other pocket or any other weapon.”            Schaaf conducted

a pat frisk of Werra's pocket and felt a hard object that he

identified as a firearm.        At that point, Schaaf removed the

firearm and gave it to Fries.         Schaaf then told Werra he was

under arrest.      Werra tried to flee, leading to a brief struggle

in which Werra was subdued.4

                           II. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

     Although Werra does not expressly quite make this

distinction, in essence he challenges two aspects of the police

conduct as grounds for suppression.          First, he claims that the

officers' entry into 63 Menlo Street violated the Fourth

Amendment.      Second, he asserts that Schaaf's stop and pat-frisk

of him violated his Fourth Amendment rights.           As a threshold

matter, I first address whether Werra has a sufficient Fourth

     4
      I note that Jeanine Daley was in fact present at 63 Menlo
Street and consequently the outstanding warrant for her was later
executed there. Although the police officers were not aware of
it at the time, Werra was also subject to an outstanding warrant.

     Case 1:06-cr-10414-DPW Document 34 Filed 09/11/08 Page 7 of 28



Amendment interest to mount either of these challenges to police

conduct.

     A.      Werra's Expectation of Privacy

     In order for Werra to contest a search or seizure on Fourth

Amendment grounds, he bears the burden of demonstrating that he

had a legitimate and reasonable expectation of privacy in the

premises searched or the thing seized.        United States v. Dunning,

312 F.3d 528, 531 (1st Cir. 2002) (per curiam).        I turn now to

evaluate whether Werra had a reasonable expectation of privacy

either as a resident of 63 Menlo Street or in his own person and

associated personal property.

     1.      Werra’s Expectation of Privacy as a Resident
             of 63 Menlo Street

     Werra’s expectation of privacy in the foyer of 63 Menlo

Street hinges largely on the proper characterization of the

building itself.    The Government contends that Werra lacked a

reasonable expectation of privacy in the foyer because the

property was essentially a multi-unit apartment building.         The

First Circuit has explained that “a tenant lacks a reasonable

expectation of privacy in the common areas of an apartment

building.”     United States v. Hawkins, 139 F.3d 29, 32 (1st Cir.

1998).    Common areas are those areas of a building “exposed both

to those who have access to that area and those, including law

enforcement officers, who may be given permission to enter that



                                   7
         Case 1:06-cr-10414-DPW Document 34 Filed 09/11/08 Page 8 of 28



area,”5 and it seems clear that hallways in multi-unit apartment

buildings fall into this category.          United States v. Burnette,

375 F.3d 10, 16 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting United States v.

Osunegbu, 822 F.2d 472, 479 (5th Cir. 1987)), vacated on other

grounds, 543 U.S. 1181 (2005); see also United States v. Legault,

323 F.Supp.2d 217, 222 (D. Mass. 2004) (citing with approval

Commonwealth v. Montanez, 410 Mass. 290, 301-03 (1991), which

held that common hallways in an apartment building were common

areas).     The majority of Circuits that have considered the issue

have also concluded that common hallways in multi-unit apartment

buildings are common areas where tenants lack a reasonable

expectation of privacy.        United States v. Nohara, 3 F.3d 1239,

1242 (9th Cir. 1993); United States v. Acosta, 965 F.2d 1248,

1252-53 (3d Cir. 1992); United States v. Holland, 755 F.2d 253,

255-56 (2d Cir. 1985); United States v. Eisler, 567 F.2d 814, 816

(8th Cir. 1977); but see United States v. Carriger, 541 F.2d 545,

550 (6th Cir. 1976) (holding that tenants of a multi-unit

apartment building had a reasonable expectation of privacy in

locked common areas, including common hallways).

     Werra, for his part, argues that 63 Menlo Street was a

“commune,” similar to a “traditional” family home where all

     5
       It bears emphasizing that my findings of fact have
determined that the police officers were not in the foyer with
permission. But at this juncture, I consider only whether Werra
has standing to object to their presence, whether or not they
were there with permission.

                                       8
     Case 1:06-cr-10414-DPW Document 34 Filed 09/11/08 Page 9 of 28



residents possess a reasonable expectation of privacy throughout

the entire dwelling.    See Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 589-

90 (1980); Kyllo v. United States, 533 U.S. 27, 34 (2001); United

States v. Paradis, 351 F.3d 21, 27 (1st Cir. 2003); United States

v. Weidul, 325 F.3d 50, 52 n.1 (1st Cir. 2003).        Consequently,

Werra maintains that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy

in the foyer.

     I agree with the general propositions advanced by both

parties.    That is, as the government contends, a person who

occupies one unit in a multi-unit apartment building does not

have a reasonable expectation of privacy in common areas of the

building.   Similarly, as the defendant contends, in a traditional

home, all residents possess a reasonable expectation of privacy

throughout the entire interior of the building.        But these well-

established conventional categories for living arrangements do

not bring the main issue here into complete focus because 63

Menlo Street does not fit squarely into the paradigm for either a

traditional family home or a multi-unit apartment building.           The

required inquiry must therefore ask whether the arrangements at

63 Menlo Street make it more like a traditional family home or

more like a multi-unit apartment building.

     The parties have not identified, and I have not found, any

reported decisions that have, with sustained reasoning, expressly

examined the distinction between traditional family homes and


                                   9
     Case 1:06-cr-10414-DPW Document 34 Filed 09/11/08 Page 10 of 28



multi-unit apartment buildings.      Determining whether a person has

a reasonable expectation of privacy in an area or an item is, of

course, a fact-specific inquiry.        Before turning to the details

of 63 Menlo Street, however, it may be useful to identify several

illustrative factors for analyzing whether a residence is more

akin to a traditional home or a multi-unit apartment building.

     The most important factor is whether or not the building

contains recognizably separate living units.        Distinct, complete

living spaces indicate that the dwelling is more like an

apartment building because each tenant’s functional home is not

shared by others in the building.       While each tenant would have a

reasonable expectation of privacy in his or her personal living

space within that kind of building, that expectation would not

extend to common areas shared with other tenants.         By contrast,

if the building did not contain compartmentalized living spaces,

the residents would effectively be living together in a single,

shared unit.   This might occur, for example, where all tenants

shared essential parts of the living space, such as bathrooms and

kitchens.   In that circumstance, each tenant would presumably

have a reasonable expectation of privacy throughout the entire

interior of the building.

     A related factor is the legal right of a resident to exclude

others from certain parts of the building.        See United States v.

Anderson, 154 F.3d 1225, 1232 n.3 (10th Cir. 1998), cert. denied,


                                   10
     Case 1:06-cr-10414-DPW Document 34 Filed 09/11/08 Page 11 of 28



526 U.S. 1159 (1999) (“The right to exclude others is an

important consideration in determining whether an individual has

[a reasonable expectation of privacy].”).       The presence or

absence of locks may be a factor in making this determination,

because it could be a manifestation of a resident’s belief that

he had the right to exclude others from a particular part of a

building.   However, the presence or absence of locks is not a

dispositive factor.    It is, for example, conceivable that an

apartment building could contain five distinct units and no

locks, because the tenants of each unit were friends or the

building was located in a safe area.      In that situation each

tenant would still presumably have the legal right to exclude

others from the unit he or she personally occupied.

     The number of people living in a building can also be

relevant in categorizing the building.       For example, if 30 people

lived in a large building, then it most likely would be

characterized as a multi-unit apartment building.         But if three

people lived in the same building, it could be either a multi-

unit apartment building or a home, depending on how the space was

divided and what rights each individual had with respect to that

space.

     I also note that the formal legal relationship among the

residents of a building is not necessarily determinative in

classifying the residence as either a traditional home or a


                                   11
        Case 1:06-cr-10414-DPW Document 34 Filed 09/11/08 Page 12 of 28



multi-unit apartment building.        For example, if two people living

together as a couple each had access to all spaces in the

dwelling, then it would be considered a traditional home, whether

or not they were legally married.          See, e.g., United States v.

Paradis, 351 F.3d at 27 (holding that the apartment of

defendant's girlfriend was his "home" for purposes of the Fourth

Amendment).

        With these considerations in mind, I now turn to analyze the

63 Menlo Street residence.        The evidence regarding the 63 Menlo

Street building lacked many details concerning the rights of the

residents within the building and the relationships among those

who lived there.      Neither Cicerano nor Werra offered detailed

testimony about the respective rights of each of the residents in

the building.      For example, it is unclear whether the residents

shared bathrooms and kitchens, to precisely what extent they were

assigned specific parts of the building, and whether they locked

doors to keep other people out.         In the absence of these key

facts, I find that Werra has not carried his burden of

demonstrating that 63 Menlo Street was akin to a traditional

home.    Rather, it was more like a multi-unit building where

Werra's reasonable expectation of privacy varied for different

locations within the building.

        Boundaries were sufficiently defined at 63 Menlo Street to

afford Werra a reasonable expectation of full privacy in the

third floor for which he paid rent.         That area contained a

                                      12
     Case 1:06-cr-10414-DPW Document 34 Filed 09/11/08 Page 13 of 28



kitchenette and appears to have been an independent living unit

from which Werra could exclude others.       But he had no reasonable

expectations of privacy in the foyer because others over whom he

had no control could pass through it without his permission.           As

to the living room, Werra's expectation of privacy was limited to

the permission for use granted by Cicerano.

     For these reasons, I conclude Werra does not have standing

to challenge the legality of the police’s entrance into 63 Menlo

Street on Fourth Amendment grounds.      Because he is unable to

contest the legality of the police entrance, he is barred from

claiming on those grounds that the evidence the police obtained

in the subsequent seizure of weapons in the foyer should be

suppressed pursuant to the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine.

     2.   Werra's Expectation of Privacy in his Person

     The question whether Werra can contest the legality of the

police’s entrance into the foyer at 63 Menlo Street is separate

from the question whether Werra may challenge the stop and pat-

frisk that Schaaf conducted of him once circumstances developed

inside the building.    Werra had an independent reasonable

expectation of privacy in his person and in associated personal

property that was not in plain view from the foyer.         In United

States v. Maddox, the Sixth Circuit explained that an individual

“retains, almost wherever he goes, a legitimate expectation of

privacy in his person.”    944 F.2d 1223, 1234 (6th Cir. 1991); see

also United States v. Thornton, 493 F.Supp.2d 1024, 1031 (S.D.

                                   13
     Case 1:06-cr-10414-DPW Document 34 Filed 09/11/08 Page 14 of 28



Ohio 2007) (noting that the Fourth Amendment “expressly provides

that [defendant] had a legitimate expectation of privacy in ‘the

invaded place,’ his ‘person.’”).        For example, although a party

guest at another person’s apartment does not have a reasonable

expectation of privacy for items found within the apartment, he

does “retain his preexisting expectation of privacy in his person

and his personal property.”     Id. at 1234 n.4.     Likewise, even

though Werra’s status as a resident of 63 Menlo Street did not

provide him with a reasonable expectation of privacy for the

foyer of the building, he did retain a reasonable expectation of

privacy in his own person while he was there.        Consequently,

Werra has a sufficient Fourth Amendment interest to challenge the

legality of the stop and pat-frisk that led to Schaaf’s seizure

of the firearm in Werra’s pocket.

     B.   The Legality of the Stop and Frisk

     Two distinct inquiries must be made in order to determine

whether Werra’s Fourth Amendment rights regarding his person were

violated by the police.    First, did the police have the authority

initially to stop or restrain Werra's movements?        Second, if they

did, did Werra present a sufficient threat to justify the

subsequent pat-frisk?

     1.   The Stop

     Schaaf’s restraint of Werra’s movements was a seizure for

purposes of the Fourth Amendment.        See Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1,

16 (1968) (“[W]henever a police officer accosts an individual and

                                   14
     Case 1:06-cr-10414-DPW Document 34 Filed 09/11/08 Page 15 of 28



restrains his freedom to walk away, he has ‘seized’ that

person.”)   I turn now to consider whether this seizure was a

valid investigatory stop under Terry v. Ohio, or alternatively,

whether it was permissible pursuant to the officers’ authority to

secure the premises in order to execute the arrest warrant for

Jeanine Daley.

     a.     The Stop of Werra was Not Permissible Under
            Terry v. Ohio

     The government contends that Schaaf’s restraint of Werra was

permissible as an investigatory stop.         In Terry, the Supreme

Court affirmed the constitutionality of investigatory stops in

certain circumstances when police lack a warrant or probable

cause.    Id. at 30.   The Court stated that investigatory stops are

permissible when a police officer “observes unusual conduct which

leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that

criminal activity may be afoot.”        Id.   In a later case, the Court

explained that “[b]ased upon [the] whole picture the detaining

officers must have a particularized and objective basis for

suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity.”

United States v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 417-18 (1981).         In

assessing the totality of the circumstances, police officers may

“draw[] inferences and make[] deductions . . . that might well

elude an untrained person.”     Id. at 418.      Additionally, “the

evidence . . . must be seen and weighted not in terms of library

analysis by scholars, but as understood by those versed in the


                                   15
     Case 1:06-cr-10414-DPW Document 34 Filed 09/11/08 Page 16 of 28



field of law enforcement.”     Id.    Finally, “[a]lthough an

officer’s reliance on a mere ‘hunch’ is insufficient to justify a

stop, the likelihood of criminal activity need not rise to the

level required for probable cause, and it falls considerably

short of satisfying a preponderance of the evidence standard.”

United States v. Arvizu, 534 U.S. 266, 274 (2002) (internal

quotation marks and citations omitted).       This standard is

described as “reasonable suspicion.”       Id.

     In this case, the police lacked reasonable suspicion that

Werra was himself engaged in any criminal activity.         The only

specific facts Schaaf identified to support his decision to stop

Werra were that Werra was walking toward him, he had what Schaaf

believed to be a knife clipped to his right front shorts pocket,

and he was moving his hand a little bit in his front left shorts

pocket.    When the totality of the circumstances are taken into

account, these facts are not sufficient to give reasonable

suspicion to a police officer that Werra was engaged in criminal

activity.

     When Werra walked into the foyer, Schaaf had already

instructed Cicerano to bring other residents of the premises to

the foyer.   Other people located on the first floor had also come

to the foyer after Cicerano was sent upstairs to gather those

present.    In light of what was happening in the residence,

Werra’s actions of walking into the foyer, when objectively

                                     16
     Case 1:06-cr-10414-DPW Document 34 Filed 09/11/08 Page 17 of 28



viewed, are not themselves either unusual or suspicious.          When

police enter a building without a warrant, it is not at all

surprising that the commotion would cause residents to come out

of their private spaces to determine what was transpiring.

Werra’s mere act of walking toward the police officers did not

provide them with the requisite reasonable suspicion to carry out

an investigatory stop.

     Werra’s possession of what was likely a concealed pocket

knife also did not provide the officers a basis for a Terry stop.

There is nothing in the record that indicates Werra’s possession

of the knife was illegal, and no testimony suggests he was

reaching for or brandishing it when he entered the foyer.

According to Schaaf’s own testimony, the type of knife Werra had

was common.   Moreover, there seems to have been no way Werra

could have walked through the pocket doors of the living room

without walking directly toward the two police officers.

Furthermore, Schaaf did not testify that Werra was walking

towards him quickly or in a threatening manner.

     The movement of Werra’s left hand did not provide the police

any better reason to stop Werra under Terry.        The police did not

know that Werra possessed a firearm before the pat-frisk, and

they did not observe a bulge in Werra’s pocket.        Werra’s simple

act of moving his hand around did not provide the police with a

particularized and objective basis for suspecting Werra was


                                   17
     Case 1:06-cr-10414-DPW Document 34 Filed 09/11/08 Page 18 of 28



engaged in criminal activity.     As a result, the police officers

were not justified in stopping Werra in a classic Terry

investigatory stop.6

     b.     The Stop of Werra was Permissible in Securing
            the Premises to Execute the Arrest Warrant of
            Jeanine Daley

     Although not argued in a developed fashion by the

government, there is an alternative to Terry to justify the

effective restraint of Werra's movements in the foyer and the pat

frisk which followed from it.     The officers were permitted to

stop Werra in order to execute the arrest warrant for Jeanine

Daley safely and effectively.     In Michigan v. Summers, the

Supreme Court held that a warrant to search for contraband

“implicitly carries with it the limited authority to detain the

occupants of the premises while a proper search is conducted.”

452 U.S. 692, 705 (1981).     In Summers, police officers approached

a house to execute a search warrant for narcotics and encountered

the defendant walking down the front steps.        Id. at 693.    The

officers sought the defendant’s assistance in entering the home

and then detained him while they carried out the search of the

premises.    Id.   The Supreme Court held that even in the absence

of any individualized suspicion of criminal activity, the



     6
      While I have considered each of Werra's actions separately
for clarity of analysis, I also find that even when viewed
collectively, they did not provide the police with reasonable
suspicion for a Terry stop.

                                   18
     Case 1:06-cr-10414-DPW Document 34 Filed 09/11/08 Page 19 of 28



detention was permissible under the Fourth Amendment.         Id. at 705

n.19 (“[T]he officer is not required to evaluate either the

quantum of proof justifying detention or the extent of the

intrusion to be imposed by the seizure”); see also Cherrington v.

Skeeter, 344 F.3d 631, 638 (6th Cir. 2003) (explaining that

police officers have the authority to briefly detain “even wholly

innocent bystanders” when executing a warrant).        The Court

explained that when police are executing a warrant, the liberty

interest of an occupant of the premises is outweighed by the

substantial law enforcement interest in exercising “unquestioned

command of the situation” in order to protect the safety of the

officers, execute the warrant in an orderly manner, and prevent

the flight of any suspects.     Id. at 702-03.     Although Summers

dealt with the execution of a search warrant, several courts have

persuasively extended its application to the execution of arrest

warrants, holding that the same law enforcement interests are

applicable in both scenarios.     See Cherrington, 344 at 638;

United States v. Enslin, 327 F.3d 788, 797 (9th Cir. 2003), cert.

denied, 540 U.S. 917 (2003); Anderson v. United States, 107

F.Supp.2d 191 (E.D.N.Y. 2000), aff’d, 41 Fed. Appx. 506 (2d Cir.

2002).

     The authority of police to detain individuals under Summers,

however, is limited by the authority of the police to conduct the

underlying search or arrest.     See Jacobs v. City of Chicago, 215

F.3d 758, 772 (7th Cir. 2000) (“[W]here a search is illegal and

                                   19
     Case 1:06-cr-10414-DPW Document 34 Filed 09/11/08 Page 20 of 28



not supported by probable cause, the justification for using the

search as the foundation for the seizure disappears because it

was the connection of the individual with a location suspected of

harboring criminal activity that provided the reasonable basis

for the seizure.”); Marks v. Clarke, 102 F.3d 1012, 1032 (9th

Cir. 1997) (holding that Summers would not “authorize detaining

the occupants in furtherance of an illegal search”); Hill v.

McIntyre, 884 F.2d 271, 278 (6th Cir. 1989) (holding that the

reasonableness of a Summers detention depended on “the existence

of probable cause and on the propriety of the search.”).          For the

detention of Werra to have been permissible under Summers,

therefore, both the arrest warrant for Jeanine Daley and the

manner in which it was executed by the officers must have been

proper.7   The validity of the arrest warrant has not been


     7
       In United States v. Leon, the Supreme Court held that
where police officers properly executed an invalid warrant that
they reasonably thought was valid, the exclusionary rule should
not apply to any subsequently discovered evidence. 468 U.S. 897,
918-19 (1984). The Court, however, limited this exception to
cases where “the officers properly executed the warrant and
searched only those places and for those objects that it was
reasonable to believe were covered by the warrant.” Id. at 918.
On this basis, several Circuit Courts have refused to extend the
Leon “good faith” exception to the improper execution of a
warrant. See United States v. Medlin, 798 F.2d 407, 410 (10th
Cir. 1986) (“Unlike cases in which the police properly execute an
invalid warrant that they reasonably thought was valid, in cases
of improper execution there is police conduct that must be
deterred.”); United States v. Hitchcock, 286 F.3d 1064 (9th Cir.
2002), amended on other grounds, 298 F.3d 1021 (9th Cir. 2002);
see also United States v. Husband, 226 F.3d 626, 636 (7th Cir.
2000) (noting the court was “not convinced that [Leon’s]
reasoning should be extended to situations where the challenge is
to the manner of execution of a valid warrant.”). The First

     Case 1:06-cr-10414-DPW Document 34 Filed 09/11/08 Page 21 of 28



disputed.   The determinative question, therefore, is whether the

officers were properly executing the warrant when they detained

Werra – in other words, whether the warrant authorized Schaaf and

Fries to enter the premises at 63 Menlo Street to search for and

arrest Jeanine Daley, even without obtaining the consent of any

of the building’s residents.

     In Payton v. New York, the Supreme Court held that an arrest

warrant “implicitly carries with it the limited authority to

enter a dwelling in which the suspect lives when there is reason

to believe the suspect is within.”      445 U.S. 573, 603 (1980).8     A

majority of Circuits have interpreted Payton to mean that the

police officers executing the warrant must have a “reasonable

belief” that the arrestee: (1) lives at the residence, and (2) is

within the residence at the time of entry.       United States v.

Thomas, 429 F.3d 282, 286 (D.C. Cir. 2005); cert. denied, 127

S.Ct. 660 (2006).   The “reasonable belief” standard falls short

of requiring the officers to have “probable cause.”         See

generally Solis-Alarcon v. United States, 514 F.Supp.2d 185, 195



Circuit has not expressed a view on this issue, but because I
find that the officers in this case did properly execute the
arrest warrant for Jeanine Daley, it is unnecessary for me to
address it further here.
     8
      By contrast, absent exigent circumstances, police officers
must obtain a search warrant to enter the residence of a third
party to search for the subject of an arrest warrant. See
Steagald v. United States, 451 U.S. 204, 206 (U.S. 1981); Joyce
v. Town of Tewksbury, 112 F.3d 19, 21-22 (1st Cir. 1997) (en
banc) (per curiam).

                                   21
     Case 1:06-cr-10414-DPW Document 34 Filed 09/11/08 Page 22 of 28



(D.P.R. 2007) (collecting cases).9      Although the First Circuit

has not yet directly confronted this issue, it has suggested in

dictum that it supports the “reasonable belief” standard.          See

United States v. Weems, 322 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 2003) (citing

United States v. Gay, 240 F.3d 1222, 1226-27 (10th Cir. 2001)).

Therefore, I will apply that standard in this case.         The

existence of a “reasonable belief” is not determined by the

subjective beliefs of the officers, but is instead evaluated

objectively, based on what a reasonable police officer in the

same position would have reasonably believed.        See El Bey v.

Roop, 530 F.3d 407, 416-17 (6th Cir. 2008); United States v.

Clayton, 210 F.3d 841, 844-45 (8th Cir. 2000).        Cf. Bolton v.

Taylor, 367 F.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 2004) (applying an “objective

observer” analysis to determine whether there was “reasonable

suspicion” to justify a Terry stop).

     Although it is a close question, I conclude that the arrest

warrant authorized the officers to enter the premises at 63 Menlo

Street to search for and arrest Jeanine Daley.        Before going to

63 Menlo Street, Schaaf and Fries spoke with an informant named

Christine, who had previously provided Schaaf with accurate

information concerning the whereabouts of a suspect.         Christine


     9
      Among the Circuits that have considered the issue, only the
Ninth Circuit has come to a contrary conclusion, holding that
Payton requires the police to have probable cause that the
subject lives at the residence and is present at the time of
entry. See United States v. Gorman, 314 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.
2002).

                                   22
     Case 1:06-cr-10414-DPW Document 34 Filed 09/11/08 Page 23 of 28



told Schaaf that Daley was “staying at 63 Menlo Street,”10 and

that she had seen Daley there recently.       Schaaf was also aware

that Jeanine Daley had been a drug abuser, and on his previous

visit to 63 Menlo Street he had observed it to be a sober house

with tenants living on the premises.

     To be sure, this evidence is thin.       For example, the

officers did not conduct any surveillance of the premises to

verify that Jeanine Daley was staying there, see, e.g., Solis-

Alarcon v. United States, 514 F. Supp. 2d at 193 (finding a

“reasonable belief” of suspect’s residence in part because agents

had observed the suspect’s car parked at the location), nor did

they seek verification from other sources that she was indeed a

resident, see, e.g., United States v. Pelletier, 469 F.3d 194,

197 (1st Cir. 2006) (finding a “reasonable belief” of suspect’s

residence in part because officers confirmed with maintenance

worker that suspect was sole occupant of a motel room).

Furthermore, the arrest warrant for Daley indicated a different

address: 10 Marshall Road in North Easton.

     Nonetheless, considering the circumstances in their

entirety, I find that the officers had a sufficient basis to form

a “reasonable belief” that Jeanine Daley lived at 63 Menlo

Street.   The tip that Daley was “staying at” that address came


     10
      Fries could not recall whether Christine provided the
precise address but did recall that she provided enough
information that Schaaf could identify the building to which she
was referring.

                                   23
     Case 1:06-cr-10414-DPW Document 34 Filed 09/11/08 Page 24 of 28



from a previously reliable informant and was consistent with what

Schaaf knew about both Daley’s drug abuse and the building at 63

Menlo Street.    See United States v. Lauter, 57 F.3d 212, 215 (2d

Cir. 1995) (holding that a tip from a reliable informant that a

suspect recently moved into a particular apartment was sufficient

to justify a “reasonable belief” that the suspect lived there);

see also Thomas, 429 F.3d at 286 (accepting, without any further

details, that officers had a “reasonable belief” a suspect lived

at a particular address because they had done an

“investigation”).   The fact that Menlo Street may not have been

Daley’s permanent home, if indeed she had one, is not

determinative.   For the purposes of a Payton analysis, a

suspect’s residence can include not only the suspect’s permanent

home but also a temporary residence, such as a motel room where

the suspect effectively lived at the time of the entry.          See

United States v. Pelletier, 469 F.3d 194, 199 (1st Cir.         2006);

see also United States v. Weems, 322 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 2003)

(noting in dictum that if the defendant “effectively lived” where

he was found, “the arrest warrant itself would be enough to

authorize entry . . . to effectuate his arrest”).         But see Perez

v. Simmons, 884 F.2d 1136, 1141 (9th Cir. 1988) (holding that

Payton only allows entry into a suspect’s “actual home” and not a

temporary residence).

     Furthermore, I find that the officers had sufficient basis

to form a “reasonable belief” that Daley would be present at the

                                   24
     Case 1:06-cr-10414-DPW Document 34 Filed 09/11/08 Page 25 of 28



time of their entry into the premises.       The officers arrived

relatively early in the morning, at approximately 10:00 a.m., and

Christine told Shaaf that she had seen Daley at that location

“recently.”   See Thomas, 429 F.3d at 286 (“As for whether the

officers had reason to believe Thomas would be at home when they

executed the warrant, the early morning hour was reason

enough.”); see also United States v. Hayes, 209 Fed. Appx. 548,

551 (7th Cir. 2006) (per curiam, unpublished) (finding a

“reasonable belief” that suspect would be home at 10:00 a.m.

where suspect was an unemployed drug addict).

     Therefore, although the government indicated at oral

argument that it did not believe the arrest warrant was a

sufficient basis for the police to enter 63 Menlo Street without

consent (Tr. 3:12-14, Oct. 15, 2007), I find that a reasonable

officer in the same position could have formed an objectively

“reasonable belief” that Jeanine Daley lived at the premises and

was present at the time of entry.       The arrest warrant gave the

officers the authority to enter the building, and, under Summers,

the authority to detain occupants temporarily in order to search

for Daley safely and effectively.11      On this basis, I conclude


     11
       When a search warrant authorizes officers to enter a
residence, they are still required to give notice of their
“authority and purpose” before entering without consent. See 18
U.S.C. § 3109. Arguably, the officers’ failure to inform
Cicerano that they had an arrest warrant for a resident of the
building fell short of this responsibility. See Miller v. United
States, 357 U.S. 301 (1958); but see United States v. One Parcel
of Real Property, 873 F.2d 7, 9-10 (1st Cir. 1989) (noting that

                                   25
     Case 1:06-cr-10414-DPW Document 34 Filed 09/11/08 Page 26 of 28



that the officers had sufficient justification for initially

stopping and restricting Werra’s movements, and I now turn to

consider the propriety of the pat-frisk.

     2.   The Pat-Frisk

     Simply because a stop can be made does not necessarily mean

that a police officer may conduct a frisk of the stopped

individual.   Rather, an officer generally “must be able to point

to particular facts from which he reasonably inferred that the

individual was armed and dangerous” in order to conduct a frisk.

Sibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40, 64 (1968).        See also Ybarra v.

Illinois, 444 U.S. 85, 93 (1979) (holding, by analogy to Terry,

that an officer executing a search warrant may only frisk persons

present “to find weapons that he reasonably believes or suspects

are then in the possession of the person he has accosted.”).

Police do not need to be absolutely certain that an individual is

armed or dangerous, but the evidence must demonstrate that “a

reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in

the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger.”

Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. at 27.     The determinative question,



“an express announcement would be a useless gesture if the
house’s occupant already knew the police’s purpose”). Even so,
violations of the so-called “knock and announce” rule do not
require application of the exclusionary rule to subsequently
discovered evidence, where the police had a valid grant of
authority to enter the target’s residence. See Hudson v.
Michigan, 547 U.S. 586, 596 (2006); United States v. Jones, 523
F.3d 31, 36 (1st Cir. 2008). It is therefore unnecessary to
resolve this issue here.

                                   26
     Case 1:06-cr-10414-DPW Document 34 Filed 09/11/08 Page 27 of 28



therefore, is whether a reasonably prudent police officer would

have been warranted in concluding that Werra posed an objective

threat of danger to the police or others.

     I find that under the circumstances confronting the officers

the pat-down frisk of Werra was justified.       According to Schaaf’s

testimony, after Werra walked into the foyer, Schaaf stopped him

and removed the knife that was clipped to his pocket “for

[Schaaf’s] safety, [Werra’s] safety, and also Trooper Fries’

safety.”   This seems a prudent step given that the officers were

seeking a fugitive in a building with multiple floors and at

least several occupants.    To be sure, Werra did not appear to

pose an imminent threat to the police officers at that point; as

I have discussed, Werra’s act of walking into the foyer was not

unusual under the circumstances and was not itself threatening.

Nevertheless, the officers' suspicion that the premises was being

used as a drug house, when coupled with the readily identifiable

knife clipped to Werra's pants and his act of walking into the

foyer, formed a sufficient basis for an objective officer to

conclude that Werra was armed and potentially dangerous - even if

it was not a sufficient basis to conclude Werra was himself

engaged in criminal activity.     See Section II.B.1.a, supra.         With

the knife in one pocket, Werra’s act of moving his hands slightly

in his other pocket as he approached Schaaf lent further support

for the conclusion that he posed a potential threat to the safety

of the officers.   Consequently, Schaaf's seizure of Werra's knife

                                   27
     Case 1:06-cr-10414-DPW Document 34 Filed 09/11/08 Page 28 of 28



and his pat-frisk of Werra’s pocket were justified.

                            II. CONCLUSION

     For the foregoing reasons, I DENY Werra’s motion to

suppress.
