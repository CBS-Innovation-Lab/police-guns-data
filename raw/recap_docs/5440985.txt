vii COURT DETERMINATIONS 0F REST!TUTION
A {Zl Restttution Not Applicabte.

B Total Amount of Restitution:
C Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

l [:I For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under lS U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U,S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

2 [:l For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under lS U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount ofthe victims’ losses would complicate or prolong thc sentencing process to a degree
that thc need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(B).
3 l:l For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3663 and/or required by thc sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
ordered bccausc thc complication and prolongation of thc sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh

thc need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a](l)(B)(ii}.

4 ij Rcstitution is not ordered for other rcasons. (Explain.]
