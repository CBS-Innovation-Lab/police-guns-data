                     PARTIAL RULING ON DEFENDANT’S
                          MOTION TO SUPPRESS

      This is a prosecution for possession of unregistered destructive devices,

specifically pipe bombs. Apparently they were discovered unexpectedly while

agents were conducting a search for illegal drug activity and a firearm.

      The defendant Michael Pressey has filed a motion to suppress evidence on

the following grounds:

      1.    That the search warrant affidavit does not contain probable cause;

      2.    That the issuing judge was not authorized to issue a search warrant;

      3.    That the search exceeded the scope of the warrant;

      4.    That there was no probable cause for his arrest and the resulting

evidence of his identity and his bedroom; and

      5.    That he was not advised of his Miranda rights upon arrest and before

questioning.

      I DENY the motion to the extent that it is based on Grounds 1, 2, and 3.

Ground 1: Adequacy of the Affidavit

       Pressey argues that the affidavit did not provide a basis for the issuing judge

to evaluate “the credibility and reliability of the source of the information” the

affiant relied upon. Mot. to Suppress Evid. at 2 (Docket Item 39). He focuses in

particular upon the use of a confidential informant who, he says, provided “the

only evidence of Mr. Pressey’s involvement in any of the drug transactions.” Id. at

2-3.   He argues that “[a]bsolutely no information is offered concerning the

reliability of the informant.”    Id. at 3.   I disagree.   The affidavit recounted

numerous instances where the confidential informant’s information was confirmed

by law enforcement, as well as the informant’s activities while wearing an

electronic monitoring device and under surveillance. It also established that

Pressey lived next door to a William Hopkins who was dealing drugs, and that

there was regular traffic back and forth between their respective apartments. On

one occasion when the informant told agents that he had been informed that

Hopkins went next door to Pressey’s apartment to get drugs, an agent conducting

surveillance saw someone leave the drug dealer’s apartment, go to Pressey’s

apartment, enter, and then return. Aff. and Request for Search Warrant ¶ 15

(Docket Item 39-1). Likewise, Special Agent Calloway “told me [the affiant] that he

watched [an individual] walk over to [Pressey’s apartment] and saw Pressey and

[the other individual] exit the side porch door at [Pressey’s apartment] and return

back over to the garage at [the adjacent apartment] and provide [the confidential

informant] a glassine baggie containing white powder believed to be cocaine.” Id.

¶ 36. That white powder was turned over to agents and field tested positively for
                                                                                    2

cocaine. Id. ¶ 37. I conclude that under the standards established by Illinois v.

Gates, 462 U.S. 213 (1983), there was enough in the affidavit to support the

veracity of the informant and enough to support probable cause for searching

Pressey’s residence.

Ground 2: Authority of the Issuing Judge

      The search warrant was issued by a Maine Superior Court Justice. In the

past, only Maine district judges issued warrants. But in 2007 Maine’s Chief

Justice, acting pursuant to statutory authority, expressly authorized Superior

Court Justices to sit as District Court judges. My colleague Judge Woodcock has

recently reviewed the state law on the subject and concluded that warrants issued

by Superior Court Justices are valid.       United States v. Cameron, 2009 WL

2832247 (Sept. 1, 2009). I agree completely with his reasoning and see no reason

to repeat it.

Ground 3: Scope of the Warrant vs. Scope of the Search

      The warrant authorized the search of the premises and of any vehicles

under Pressey’s control. The warrant also authorized seizure of illegal drugs and

related evidence. It also authorized seizure of firearms, explosive devices, etc. but

only if the premises were found to contain illegal drug-related evidence. Search

Warrant ¶ F (Docket Item 45).

      Pressey argues that “[t]he search of the closed containers where the pipe

bombs were allegedly located, exceeded the scope of the search warrant.” Mot. to

Suppress at 10. He is wrong. Under the warrant, the agents were entitled to

search the containers to see if they contained illegal drugs. United States v.
                                                                                   3

Rogers, 521 F.3d 5, 10 (1st Cir. 2008) (approving search of containers if it is

reasonable to believe that they might conceal items subject to the warrant). Once

agents discovered the illegal pipe bombs in the closed containers, they were

entitled to seize the pipe bombs as illegal contraband irrespective of the warrant-

based authority. United States v. Robles, 45 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1995) (“Law

enforcement agents may seize evidence in plain view during a lawful search even

though the items seized are not included within the scope of the warrant.”); see

also Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128, 137-42 (1990) (holding evidence

admissible that was discovered in plain view during search for other items recited

in search warrant, even if officer conducting search was interested in discovering

evidence not specifically mentioned in warrant).

      The motion is therefore DENIED IN PART.

      The motion shall be scheduled for an evidentiary hearing on Grounds 4 and

5.
