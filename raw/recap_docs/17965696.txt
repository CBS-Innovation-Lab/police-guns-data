                 ORDER ON MOTION TO REDUCE SENTENCE


      Based upon the retroactive drug calculation Guideline, which took effect

November 1, 2014, the defendant Patricia Morrison has filed a motion seeking a

reduction of her previously imposed sentence.         U.S. Sentencing Guidelines

Manual app. C, Amendment 782 (2014); U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual

§ 1B1.10(d) (2014).

      At her sentencing in April, 2009, Morrison was held responsible for 2.97

kilograms of cocaine base, which generated a base offense level (BOL) of 36. She

then received a 2-level increase for possessing firearms, a 3-level increase for her

role in the offense and a 3-level reduction for accepting responsibility, resulting

in a total offense level (TOL) of 38. She had a Criminal History Category III,

making her guideline range 292 to 365 months. However, she then received a

downward departure because of her criminal history under Guideline § 4A1.3

and a variant sentence below the range. Ultimately, I sentenced Morrison to 180

months’ imprisonment.
      Under the newly amended drug calculations, Morrison’s base offense level

is reduced to 34 and her total offense level is reduced to 36. With her Criminal

History Category III, this results in a revised guideline range for Morrison of 235

to 293 months.

      Because the original sentence I imposed is below the low end of the revised

guideline range, Morrison is not eligible for any further reduction. See U.S.

Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 1B1.10(b)(2)(A) (“the court shall not reduce the

defendant’s term of imprisonment . . . to a term that is less than the minimum

of the amended guideline range”).

      The motion to reduce sentence is DENIED.

      SO ORDERED.

      DATED THIS 5TH DAY OF DECEMBER, 2014
