                 GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO PETITIONER'S
              MOTION TO VACATE HIS CONVICTION AND SENTENCE
                       PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C. §2255


I.    INTRODUCTION

              The Petitioner, Luis Loriano (Loriano), files this

motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.          In his motion, Loriano

claims his attorney at the time of the entry of his guilty plea

did not provide him with effective representation.              Loriano

specifically alleges that he was not fully inform him about the

one of the elements of the offense charged in the indictment.                 He

further claims that the court erred when it failed to grant his

attorney’s post plea motion to withdraw as counsel.

      The government contends that Loriano’s claims are without

merit.      Therefore, the government requests that the motion be

denied and dismissed.



II.   TRAVEL AND FACTS

      On November 10, 2004, a federal grand jury in the District

of Rhode Island returned an indictment charging that on March 3,
       Case 1:04-cr-00108-S   Document 44   Filed 10/22/2007   Page 2 of 11



2004, Loriano possessed a firearm after having previously been

convicted of a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).

Loriano subsequently appeared before the United States District

Court on January 3, 2005 and, after having been advised of and

acknowledging his understanding of the elements of all three

charged offenses and the terms and conditions of the plea

agreement signed by him on December 28, 2004 and his agreement

with the government’s factual summary, pled guilty to the single

count of the indictment.        Subsequent to the defendant’s entry of

his guilty plea, defense counsel filed a motion to withdraw,

which the Court denied on February 15, 2005.            The Court then

sentenced the defendant on April 1, 2005 to a term of 200 months

incarceration, a five year term of supervised release and a $100

special assessment.



III.    ARGUMENT



       A.   THE LAW OF SECTION 2255 MOTIONS

       Section 2255 provides in pertinent part:

       A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established
       by Act of Congress claiming the right to be released upon
       the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the
       Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court
       was without jurisdiction to impose such a sentence, or that
       the sentence is in excess of the maximum authorized by law,
       or is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may move the
       court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or
       correct the sentence.

     A motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 is a substitute for habeas

corpus.   Relief is available under this section only if the same

relief is available under the writ.       Hill v. United States, 368

U.S. 424, 427 (1962).      The grounds justifying relief under § 2255

are limited.   Section 2255 does not grant to a defendant the

right to retry cases in which he has been adjudged guilty.

Taylor v. United States, 177 F.2d 194, 195 (4th Cir. 1949).

     In United States v. Addonizio, 442 U.S. 178, 184-85 (1979),

the Supreme Court stated:

     It has, of course, long been settled law that an error that
     may justify reversal on direct appeal will not necessarily
     support a collateral attack on a final judgment . . .
     [U]nless the claim alleges a lack of jurisdiction or
     constitutional error, the scope of collateral attack has
     remained far more limited . . . The Court has held that an
     error of law does not provide a basis for collateral attack
     unless the claimed error constituted 'a fundamental defect
     which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of
     justice'. . . Similar limitations apply with respect to
     claimed errors of fact.

See also, Davis v. United States, 417 U.S. 333, 346 (1974).

     A collateral attack may not do service for an appeal.

United States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 165 (1982); Dirring v.

United States, 370 F.2d 862, 865 (1st Cir. 1967).           To obtain

collateral relief, a prisoner must clear a significantly higher

hurdle than would exist on a direct appeal.

     The standard of review of a § 2255 motion for alleged trial

errors to which no contemporaneous objection was made is not the

plain error standard, but the cause and actual prejudice



                                    3
    Case 1:04-cr-00108-S   Document 44   Filed 10/22/2007   Page 4 of 11



standard.   Frady, 456 U.S. at 166-67.      A defendant cannot raise

in a federal habeas proceeding issues which he failed to raise at

trial or on direct appeal absent a showing of cause for the

failure and a showing of prejudice.       Prou v. United States, 199

F.3d 37, 47 (1st Cir. 1999); Knight v. United States, 37 F.3d

769, 774 (1st Cir. 1994).

     Section 2255 provides that the Court, after receiving said

motion, should hold a hearing "unless the motion and the files

and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is

entitled to no relief."     Rule 4 of the Rules Governing

Proceedings in the United States District Courts Under § 2255

provides in pertinent part that "[i]f it plainly appears from the

face of the motion and any annexed exhibits and the prior

proceedings in the case that the movant is not entitled to relief

in the District Court, the judge shall make an order for its

summary dismissal and cause the movant to be notified."            The

burden is on the movant to prove by a preponderance of the

evidence that he is entitled to a hearing.         Myatt v. United

States, 875 F.2d 8, 11 (1st Cir. 1989).

     The First Circuit has stated that no hearing is required

where the § 2255 motion: "(1) is inadequate on its face, or (2)

although facially adequate, is conclusively refuted as to the

alleged facts by the files and records of the case."            Moran v.

Hogan, 494 F.2d 1220, 1222 (1st Cir. 1974); United States v.


                                    4
    Case 1:04-cr-00108-S   Document 44     Filed 10/22/2007   Page 5 of 11



Carbone, 880 F.2d 1500, 1502 (1st Cir. 1989).            Moreover, the

First Circuit has also held that "no hearing is required where

the district judge is thoroughly familiar with the case."

Ouellette v. United States, 862 F.2d 371, 377 (1st Cir. 1988);

Panzardi-Alvarez v. United States, 879 F.2d 975, 985 n.8 (1st

Cir. 1989).   A District Judge's personal observation and

recollection of the events may supplement the record.              Gregory v.

United States, 585 F.2d 548, 550 n.l (1st Cir. 1978); United

States v. DiCarlo, 575 F.2d 952, 954-55 (1st Cir. 1978).               In

considering a motion under § 2255, the District Court should

accept the movant's allegations as true "except to the extent

they are contradicted by the record, inherently incredible, or

conclusions rather than facts."         United States v. Mosquera, 845

F.2d 1122, 1124 (1st Cir. 1988).



     B.   INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL

     The two-part test for evaluating ineffective assistance of

counsel claims was established by the Supreme Court in Strickland

v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-688 (1984).           A defendant must

show both: 1) that his attorney's performance fell below an

objective standard of reasonableness; and 2) that he was

prejudiced as a result of his attorney's deficient performance.

Id.; Mathews v. Rakiey, 54 F.3d 908, 916 (1st Cir. 1995); Scarpa

v. Dubois, 38 F.3d 1, 8-9 (1st Cir. 1994); United States v.


                                    5
    Case 1:04-cr-00108-S   Document 44   Filed 10/22/2007    Page 6 of 11



Caggiano, 899 F.2d 99, 101 (1st Cir. 1990).        The defendant’s

burden is by the preponderance of the evidence.

     With regard to the first element, "[c]ounsel's judgment is

subject to highly deferential review," United States v. Gomes,

177 F.3d 76, 83 (1st Cir. 1999) and "[a] fair assessment of

attorney performance requires that every effort be made to

eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight."             Strickland, 466

U.S. at 689.   The defendant must establish that counsel's

performance was not within the wide range of reasonable

professional assistance.     Singleton v. United States, 26 F.3d

233, 238 (1st Cir. 1994).     The Court should indulge a "'strong

presumption that counsel's conduct falls within a wide range of

reasonable professional assistance.'"       Singleton, 26 F.3d at 238

(quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689); See also Scarpa, 38 F.3d

at 8.

     Prejudice exists when there is a “reasonable probability

that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the

proceeding would have been different.”        Strickland, 466 U.S. at

694; Gonzalez-Soberal v. United States, 244 F.3d 273 (1st Cir.

2001).   Where, as here, the focus of the ineffective assistance

claim is defense counsel’s performance during the plea process,

the prejudice requirement should be focused on whether counsel’s

constitutionally defective performance affected the outcome of

the plea process.    Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 57, 59 (1985).              The


                                    6
    Case 1:04-cr-00108-S   Document 44   Filed 10/22/2007   Page 7 of 11



petitioner, therefore, must show that, but for defense counsel’s

errors, there is a reasonable probability that he would not have

pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.             Id.



     C.   ISSUES

     1.    Understanding the Elements of the Offense

     Loriano complains that his attorney failed to fully explain

to him the elements of the offense charged in the indictment.

If, in fact, the petitioner did plead guilty to this crime

without having been informed of the elements, the plea would be

invalid and should be vacated.      Bradshaw v. Stumpf, 545 U.S. 175,

182-83 (2005).     That, however, was not the situation here.

Rather, the defendant’s own sworn statements clearly establish

that, prior to the entry of his guilty pleas, he was both

informed and well aware of the elements of the offense charged in

the indictment.

     During the course of the change of plea hearing on January

3, 2005, Loriano, while under oath and in response to a series of

questions from the Court, stated that he had received a copy of

the indictment and reviewed it with his attorney (plea transcript

@ pp. 3-4).   He further affirmed that he understood the charge

brought against him in the instant case and that he was satisfied

with the representation he had received from his defense counsel

(plea transcript @ p. 4).     Subsequent to that exchange with the


                                    7
    Case 1:04-cr-00108-S   Document 44   Filed 10/22/2007   Page 8 of 11



Court, the prosecutor listed aloud in the petitioner’s presence

the elements of the offense in question (plea transcript @ p.

18), followed by a review of the evidence that the government

would have introduced to prove those elements beyond a reasonable

doubt (plea transcript @ pp. 18-20).       Loriano, who was still

under oath, then acknowledged that he had listened carefully to

the prosecutor’s recitation of the facts and agreed that they

were an accurate description of what actually happened in this

case (plea transcript @ pp. 20-21).       Significantly, the

prosecutor specifically mentioned the commerce element in his

review of the elements of the offense (plea transcript @ p. 18).

Furthermore, during the factual recitation, the prosecutor stated

that the government would have introduced evidence establishing

that the firearm possessed by Loriano had been manufactured

outside of the State of Rhode Island and then subsequently

transported over state lines, thereby becoming part of interstate

commerce (plea transcript @ p. 20).       Since the government need

only prove that the firearm unlawfully possessed by Loriano

traveled in interstate commerce at some point in its existence,

the prosecutor’s statement of the evidence the government

intended to introduce on this point and the defendant’s agreement

with those facts is more than sufficient to establish the

required nexus with interstate commerce.        Scarborough v. United




                                    8
       Case 1:04-cr-00108-S    Document 44   Filed 10/22/2007    Page 9 of 11



States, 431 U.S. 563 (1977); United States v. Cory, 207 F.3d 84,

88-91 (1st Cir. 2000).

       2.    Court’s Denial of Counsel’s Motion to Withdraw

       Loriano also complains that Court erred by denying his

counsel’s motion to withdraw, which was filed after the Loriano’s

entry of his guilty plea but before sentencing.                 In support of

his argument, defendant claims that he only pled guilty because

defense counsel told him that he would be convicted based upon

his criminal record.          He further asserts that he was dissatisfied

with the advice given to him by counsel during the pendency of

the instant case.       All of those assertions are, however,

contradicted by Loriano’s sworn statements during the January 3rd

change of plea hearing.

       At the time of that hearing, Loriano stated under oath that

he was satisfied with his attorney’s representation (plea

transcript @ p. 4).       He also assured the Court that no one had

attempted to force him to plead guilty (plea transcript @ p. 12)

and that it was his wish to plead guilty (plea transcript @ p.

21).

       3. Failure to File Complaint

       Loriano contends that the government was required to file a

new complaint against him following the dismissal of his first

indictment.      That contention is simply inaccurate.             Furthermore,

Loriano mistakenly claims that the government failed to initiate


                                        9
      Case 1:04-cr-00108-S   Document 44   Filed 10/22/2007   Page 10 of 11



a second set of grand jury proceedings.          A review of the record

reveals that a second grand jury did return an indictment against

the defendant in the instant case on November 10, 2004.



VI.   CONCLUSION

      The United States therefore requests that the petitioner’s

motion be denied and dismissed.
