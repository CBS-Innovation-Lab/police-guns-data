                 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                       DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

           v.                           Criminal No. 09-cr-92-01-JL

Matthew Miller


                                O R D E R


      The assented to motion to reschedule jury trial (document no.

10) filed by defendant is granted in part.            The continuance is

limited to 60 days.

      Defendant shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights within 10

days.   The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting

a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), for the

reasons set forth in the motion.

      SO ORDERED.
