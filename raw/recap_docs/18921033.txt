                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                         DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                   Criminal No. 05-cr-279-01-JD


David P. Lafond

                                  O R D E R

     On October 20, 2009, defendant David P. Lafond appeared for

a probable cause hearing under Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.1 on one

alleged violation of conditions of supervision.            I therefore find

probable cause to hold him for a revocation hearing.

     Defendant sought bail conditions under Rule 32.1(a)(6).

Under Rule 32.1(a)(6) defendant bears the burden of establishing

by clear and convincing evidence that he will not flee and that

he poses no danger to any other person or to the community. There

was no evidence of supervised release.          However, he has been

convicted of being a felon in possession, violated for assaulting

an ex-girlfriend, given a second chance for using alcohol and now

charged with operating a vehicle as an habitual offender.                Each

of these demonstrate an indifference to restrictions against

dangerous conduct.       That history, including his current charge,

demonstrates that he is a danger to the community.             There are no

conditions which are likely to assure his presence and the safety

of the community.

      Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the defendant be detained

pending trial.

      The defendant is committed to the custody of the Attorney

General or her designated representative for confinement in a

corrections facility separate, to the extent practicable, from

persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody

pending appeal.     The defendant shall be afforded a reasonable

opportunity for private consultation with defense counsel.             On

order of a court of the United States or on request of an

attorney for the government, the person in charge of the

corrections facility shall deliver the defendant to the United

States Marshal for the purpose of an appearance in connection

with a court proceeding.

      SO ORDERED.
