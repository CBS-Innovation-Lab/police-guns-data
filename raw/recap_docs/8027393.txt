                 GOVERNMENT’S MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF ITS
                    OBJECTION TO PETITIONER'S MOTION TO
                      VACATE, SET ASIDE, OR CORRECT HIS
                     SENTENCE PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C. § 2255

I.      INTRODUCTION

        Petitioner's argues that his counsel in the District Court was constitutionally inadequate in

that before petitioner pleaded guilty counsel did not negotiate an agreement with the government

that petitioner was not an armed career criminal as defined by 18 U.S.C. § 924(e). Petitioner

says that he was unaware that he faced a possible fifteen year sentence if he pleaded guilty to an

"alleged sale of a $200 handgun."

        First, the government would not have agreed that petitioner was not an armed career

criminal. That was for the court to decide during the sentencing phase. Second, the record is

clear that petitioner was aware that he faced a possible fifteen year sentence. Third, it was in

petitioner's benefit to have pleaded guilty. He thus avoided a sentence higher than fifteen years.

His motion should be denied.

II.     FACTS

        The following are the government's facts as set forth in the presentence report to which

petitioner did not object.
     Case 1:05-cr-00074-T-LDA          Document 30        Filed 03/03/2008      Page 4 of 9



       On March 10, 2005, one Thomas Brett called the Westerly Police to report that his house

had been burglarized sometime after noon on March 8. There were many items stolen including

four handguns.

       On March 11th a tip led the police to call a Mac Hindle about one of the stolen guns, a

Jennings 9mm. Hindle said that on March 9th he got a telephone call at his apartment in Westerly

from his upstairs neighbor, Cindy O'Malley, who is William Bennett's sister. She told him that

Bennett had a pistol for sale.

       Sometime later William Bennett arrived at Hindle's apartment, came in and showed

Hindle a Jennings 9mm in a leather shoulder holster. Hindle gave $200 to Bennett and Bennett

gave him the gun and holster.

       After talking to the police Hindle took them to this apartment and gave them the Jennings

9mm. It was one of the stolen guns.

       The police knew Bennett had a felony record so they went to his house and asked him if

he would come down to the police station to talk about a gun. Bennett came down, was read his

rights, and was asked about the Jennings 9mm. Bennett denied breaking into anyone's house but

did admit to selling Hindle the gun.

       Further tips led the police separately to two other men. One was a small-time drug dealer

who turned over another one of the stolen guns to the police. He said that he had bought it from

Bennett. The other man was a felon from nearby Connecticut who also turned over another of

the stolen guns to the police. He said that he had bought it from Bennett.

       Bennett has a felony record and the gun was not manufactured in Rhode Island. Two

other felons were charged by the State of Rhode Island with committing the burglary. Bennett

       Case 1:05-cr-00074-T-LDA          Document 30        Filed 03/03/2008       Page 5 of 9



was not charged with burglary; there was insufficient proof that he had committed it.

         After being indicted as a felon in possession of a firearm, petitioner pleaded guilty. His

counsel contested the ACC designation and lost. Petitioner received the mandatory minimum

sentence: fifteen years.

III.     THE LAW

         a.     Timeliness

                It appears that this motion is timely in that it was filed January 24, 2008 which is

within the one year time period from the denial of petitioner's petition for writ of certiorari by the

U.S. Supreme Court on March 26, 2007.

         b.     Ineffective Assistance Claims

         A defendant who claims that he was deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to effective

assistance of counsel must demonstrate:

         (1)    That his counsel's performance "fell below an objective standard of
                reasonableness:"; and

         (2)    "[A] reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result
                of the proceeding would have been different."

Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 694 (1984). See Cofske v. United States, 290

F.3d 437, 441 (1st Cir. 2002).

         In assessing the adequacy of counsel's performance:

                [T]he Court looks to "prevailing professional norms." A flawless
                performance is not required. All that is required is a level of
                performance that falls within generally accepted boundaries of
                competence and provides reasonable assistance under the
                circumstances.

      Case 1:05-cr-00074-T-LDA          Document 30         Filed 03/03/2008       Page 6 of 9



Ramirez v. United States, 17 F.Supp, 2d 63, 66 (D.R.I. 1998) (quoting Scarpa v. DuBois, 38 F.3d

1, 8 (1st cir. 1994) and citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688). Under the second prong of the

Strickland test, a defendant must show actual prejudice. Id. at 693.

IV.     ARGUMENT

It is clear from both the plea agreement and the plea colloquy that defendant was well aware that

he could face a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years if he were found to be an armed

career criminal. The agreement specifically states that if the court finds "that he shall be

sentenced pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1) there is a minimum sentence of fifteen years

imprisonment." Exhibit A, p.3. In the plea colloquy defendant said that he has been read the

plea agreement by his lawyer and that he understood it. Exhibit C, p. 12.

        During the plea hearing the prosecutor told the court that there was going to be a disputed

issue as to whether one of petitioner's burglaries qualified as a violent felony, and that this had a

bearing as whether he was an armed career criminal. Exhibit C, pp. 3,4. The court further

informed petitioner of the possibility that he could be found to be an armed career criminal and

thus receive a minimum sentence of fifteen years. Exhibit C, p. 14. Furthermore the court made

a finding that defendant understood the nature and consequences of the plea.       At the plea

hearing the court read defendant the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty, including his

right to a trial. Exhibit C, p.15.

        Defense counsel's strategy in this case made sense. The evidence that petitioner

committed the crime of being a felon in possession of a firearm was very strong: the gun buyer

was prepared to testify that the gun was sold by petitioner in a hand-to-hand exchange in the

buyer's own apartment, the gun was recovered from the buyer by the police and petitioner


                                                  4
     Case 1:05-cr-00074-T-LDA            Document 30        Filed 03/03/2008      Page 7 of 9



admitted to the police that he had made the sale of the gun. Defendant has a number of felony

convictions. This was not a case of a gun recovered from a concealed place in a car or apartment

with no confession by the felon later charged with possessing the gun. It is highly unlikely that

defendant would have won at trial.

        By pleading guilty to the charge, defendant put himself in a position to get the benefit of a

guidelines reduction both if he were found to be an armed career criminal and if he were not. If

defendant had not pleaded guilty but instead had been found guilty after trial he would not have

received a 3 level reduction in guideline offense level and the agreement by the government to

recommend the higher of either the 15 years or the minimum applicable guideline range.

        With the plea the probation officer calculated the offense level as 30 and the criminal

history as IV (if petitioner were an armed career criminal). That range is 135-168, below the

mandatory minimum of 180 months. If he had not pleaded he would have had an offense level of

33 and criminal history category of IV. This would have given him a range of 188-235 months.

He would not have been eligible for a 180 month sentence and, given his history of violence,

could have received a 235 month sentence. If petitioner were not found to be an armed career

criminal, then his offense level would have 13 and criminal history category of III.. Whether he

won or lost the ACC argument, it benefitted petitioner to have pleaded guilty.

        Given the unsettled state of the law on what constitutes a violent felony under 18 U.S.C.

924(e), it made sense for counsel to argue that there was insufficient proof that defendant's prior

crime constituted a burglary. As this court said, "This is an issue that continues to plague this

court and other courts, and every time it seems that we have some definitive rules that we get a

different factual situation, slightly different wrinkle."


                                                   5
     Case 1:05-cr-00074-T-LDA          Document 30         Filed 03/03/2008   Page 8 of 9



       Defense counsel's level of performance fell well within the generally accepted boundaries

of competence and provided reasonable assistance under the circumstances. Petitioner was in a

difficult position and took the best course open to him.

V.     CONCLUSION

       Petitioner's motion should be denied.
