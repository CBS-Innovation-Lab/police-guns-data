                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE




United States of America

     v.                                   Criminal No. 05-cr-60-PB

Howard Fosher



                                  O R D E R


     The defendant has moved to continue the November 1, 2005

trial in the above case, citing the need for additional time to

complete plea negotiations and due to a medical condition for

which he continues to be treated.         The government does not object

to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reasons and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from November 1, 2005 to December 6, 2005.            In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
