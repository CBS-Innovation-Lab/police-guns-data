13 'f`ota| r\mount ot`Restitution:
C Rcstitiition not ordered (Check only one.):

l m l~`or offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 UiS.C § 3663 A. restitution is riot ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S.C § 3663A(c)(3}(A).

2 [j For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 UiS C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount ofthe victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S C. § 3663A(c)(3)(B).
3 m For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U,S.C. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines7 restitution is not
ordered because the complication and prolongation ofthe sentencing process resulting from the fashioning ot`a restitution order outweigh

the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U,S.C. § 3663(a)(1)(l3)(ii).
