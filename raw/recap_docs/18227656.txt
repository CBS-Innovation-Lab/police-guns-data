            RECOMMENDED DECISION ON 28 U.S.C. § 2255 MOTION

       In this action, Petitioner Arthur Adams moves, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255, to

vacate, set aside or correct his sentence. (Motion, ECF No. 57.) Following a guilty plea,

Petitioner was convicted in 2005 of being a felon in possession of a firearm; the Court

sentenced Petitioner to 192 months in prison. (Judgment, ECF No. 27 at 1-2.) The First

Circuit affirmed the sentence. (United States v. Adams, No. 05-2261 (1st Cir. Mar. 29,

2006).) In his section 2255 motion, Petitioner challenges his sentence based on Johnson

v. United States, --- U.S. ---, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015). In his reply, he also argues that he is

entitled to relief under Mathis v. United States, --- U.S. ---, 136 S. Ct. 2243 (2016). (Reply,

ECF No. 64 at 2.) Specifically, Petitioner argues that several of the prior convictions on

which his Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), sentence was based

no longer qualify as ACCA predicate offenses after Johnson and Mathis. (Reply at 1-2.)

           Following a review of Petitioner’s motion and the Government’s request for

dismissal, I recommend that the Court grant the Government’s request, and dismiss

Petitioner’s motion.

                   I.      FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

           Petitioner was indicted in February 2005 for being a felon in possession of a firearm,

pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1), 924(e). (Indictment, ECF No. 1.) The indictment

alleged several prior state felonies, of which two Massachusetts convictions for unarmed

burglary are at issue here: (1) a 1994 conviction (three counts) (Middlesex Cty. Sup. Ct.,

No. 1994-00104); and (2) a 1992 conviction (Middlesex Cty. Sup. Ct., No. 1992-441).1

           Petitioner pled guilty to the federal charge in April 2005. (Minute Entry for Change

of Plea Hearing, ECF No. 21.) At Petitioner’s sentencing in 2005, the Court found the

facts as set forth in the revised presentence investigation report.                   (Sentencing Tr.,

ECF No. 35 at 19.) The Court found that Petitioner was an armed career criminal within

the meaning of section 924(e), based on at least three prior violent felonies; the Court,

1
    Several other prior convictions are not at issue:

         The Government does not argue in its sur-reply that Petitioner’s 1994 Massachusetts conviction for
breaking and entering a dwelling in the daytime (nine counts) (Middlesex Cty. Sup. Ct., No. 1994-104)
qualifies as a predicate offense under 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), following Mathis v. United States, --- U.S. ---,
136 S. Ct. 2243 (2016). (Sur-reply, ECF No. 67 at 2.) The Government concedes that Petitioner’s 1986
Maine aggravated assault conviction (Me. Super. Ct., Cum. Cty., No. 86-763) would not qualify as a
predicate offense under the force clause of section 924(e)(2)(B)(i), following Bennett v. United States,
Nos. 1:94-cr-11-GZS, 1:16-cv-251-GZS, 2016 WL 3676145, 2016 U.S. Dist. Lexis 87254 (D. Me. July 6,
2016). (Response, ECF No. 60 at 9.) However, the Government preserves its objection as to the Maine
aggravated assault conviction. (Id.) The Government concedes that Petitioner’s 2000 Connecticut
conviction of escape (No. W11D-CR00-0109881-S) does not qualify as a predicate offense after Johnson
v. United States, --- U.S. ---, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015). (Id. at 2 n.2.)

        Petitioner concedes that a 1986 conviction of criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon, in the
Maine Superior Court, Cumberland County (No. 85-1806), qualifies as a predicate offense. (Reply, ECF
No. 64 at 1.)

therefore, determined, pursuant to USSG § 4B1.4(b)(3)(B), that Petitioner’s adjusted

offense level was 33, rather than an otherwise applicable lower level.2 (Sentencing Tr. at

19.) Three levels were subtracted because Petitioner accepted responsibility, and thus the

    Title 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1) states:

          In the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of this title and has three previous
          convictions by any court referred to in section 922(g)(1) of this title for a violent felony or
          a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another, such
          person shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not less than fifteen years, and,
          notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court shall not suspend the sentence of, or
          grant a probationary sentence to, such person with respect to the conviction under section
          922(g).

Section 924(e)(2)(B) defines “violent felony”:

          [T]he term “violent felony” means any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term
          exceeding one year, . . . that –

          (i)        has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against
                     the person of another; or

          (ii)       is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves
                     conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.

Section 4B1.4 of the sentencing guidelines provides in part:

          (a)    A defendant who is subject to an enhanced sentence under the provisions of
          18 U.S.C. § 924(e) is an armed career criminal.

          (b) The offense level for an armed career criminal is the greatest of:

                 (1) the offense level applicable from Chapters Two and Three; or

                 (2) the offense level from § 4B1.1 (Career Offender) if applicable; or

                 (3)(A) 34, if the defendant used or possessed the firearm or ammunition in connection
                 with either a crime of violence, as defined in § 4B1.2(a), or a controlled substance
                 offense, as defined in § 4B1.2(b), or if the firearm possessed by the defendant was of
                 a type described in 26 U.S.C. 5845(a)*; or

                 (B) 33, otherwise.*

          *If an adjustment from § 3E1.1 (Acceptance of Responsibility) applies, decrease the
          offense level by the number of levels corresponding to that adjustment.

Case 2:05-cr-00008-GZS Document 69 Filed 03/16/17 Page 4 of 9                              PageID #: 276



total offense level was 30. (Id.) The Court found the Petitioner’s criminal history to be a

Category VI, which, combined with a total offense level of 30, yielded a guidelines range

of 168 to 210 months in prison. (Id. at 19-20.) The Court increased the lower end of the

range to 180 months, pursuant to USSG § 5G1.1(c)(2), based on the statutory minimum of

180 months, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1). (Id. at 20.)3

        The Court next considered the sentencing factors, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a),

and it focused particularly on the need for just punishment, deterrence, and public

protection. (Id. at 21.) The Court ordered the 192-month term of imprisonment to be

followed by a term of five years of supervised release. (Id. at 22; Judgment at 2-3.)

        Petitioner states that he signed his section 2255 motion on May 11, 2016, and it was

filed on May 16, 2016.4 (Motion at 1.)

                                           II.     DISCUSSION

        A person may move to vacate his or her sentence on one of four different grounds:

(1) “that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United

States”; (2) “that the court was without jurisdiction” to impose its sentence; (3) “that the

sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law”; or (4) that the sentence “is

otherwise subject to collateral attack.” 28 U.S.C. § 2255(a); see Knight v. United States,

3
  The Court’s reference to a lower end of the guideline range as 120 months, directly after the Court said
the lower end was to be modified to 180 months, appears to have been unintended. (Sentencing Tr., ECF
No. 35 at 20.)
4
  Petitioner's motion did not contain a declaration that Petitioner made the allegations under penalty of
perjury, pursuant to Rule 2(b)(5) of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings, which requires that the
section 2255 motion “be signed under penalty of perjury by the movant or by a person authorized to sign it
for the movant.” See 28 U.S.C. § 1746. This recommended decision assumes, without recommending a
decision on the issue, that if the Court did not dismiss the motion, the Court would permit Petitioner to file
a version that contained the required declaration.

37 F.3d 769, 772 (1st Cir. 1994). Petitioner’s motion argues essentially that the sentence

is unconstitutional under Johnson, and that, under Mathis, Petitioner no longer has the

requisite three qualified predicate offenses for armed career criminal status.

          In Johnson, the Supreme Court “struck down the ‘residual clause’ of the [ACCA]

as unconstitutionally vague.”5 Pakala v. United States, 804 F.3d 139, 139 (1st Cir. 2015)

(per curiam). In Welch v. United States, --- U.S. ---, 136 S. Ct. 1257, 1268 (2016), the

Supreme Court held that “Johnson announced a substantive rule that has retroactive effect

in cases on collateral review.” Thus, in cases in which Johnson applies, a section 2255

motion that would otherwise be untimely under section 2255(f)(1), may be considered

timely under section 2255(f)(3).6

5
    In Johnson, --- U.S. ---, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015), the Supreme Court explained:

          Federal law forbids certain people—such as convicted felons, persons committed to mental
          institutions, and drug users—to ship, possess, and receive firearms. [18 U.S.C. § 922(g)].
          In general, the law punishes violation of this ban by up to 10 years’ imprisonment.
          [18 U.S.C. § 924(a)(2)]. But if the violator has three or more earlier convictions for a
          “serious drug offense” or a “violent felony,” the Armed Career Criminal Act increases his
          prison term to a minimum of 15 years and a maximum of life. § 924(e)(1); Johnson v.
          United States, 559 U.S. 133, 136, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010). The Act defines
          “violent felony” as follows:

          “any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year . . . that—

          “(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against
          the person of another; or

          “(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves
          conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.” § 924(e)(2)(B)
          (emphasis added).

          The closing words of this definition, italicized above, have come to be known as the Act's
          residual clause.

135 S. Ct. at 2555-56. The Court held that the residual clause is unconstitutionally vague. Id. at 2557.
6
    Title 28 U.S.C.§ 2255(f) provides:

                                                       5
Case 2:05-cr-00008-GZS Document 69 Filed 03/16/17 Page 6 of 9                           PageID #: 278



       The Supreme Court, however, explicitly limited its holding in Johnson to exclude

claims based on challenges to “the four enumerated offenses, or the remainder of the Act’s

definition of a violent felony.” 135 S. Ct. at 2563. Burglary is one of the offenses

enumerated in section 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) of the ACCA. Petitioner’s prior burglary offenses

are within the enumerated crimes clause and, therefore, Johnson is inapplicable to

Petitioner’s case.

       Based on Mathis v. United States, --- U.S. ---, 136 S. Ct. 2243 (2016), Petitioner

nevertheless argues that his prior burglaries do not qualify as violent felonies under the

enumerated crimes clause of section 924(e)(2)(B). The Mathis decision, however, is not

pertinent to Petitioner’s claim. Mathis does not apply retroactively to Petitioner’s claim

because the Supreme Court has not recognized Mathis “as a case that announced a new

substantive rule that is retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review,” and Mathis

therefore “cannot be read as triggering a new one-year period for habeas relief under 28

U.S.C. § 2255(f)(3).” Dimott, 2016 WL 6068114, at *3, 2016 U.S. Dist. Lexis 142354, at



       A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a motion under this section. The limitation
       period shall run from the latest of −

           (1) the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final;

           (2) the date on which the impediment to making a motion created by governmental
           action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the
           movant was prevented from making a motion by such governmental action;

           (3) the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court,
           if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively
           applicable to cases on collateral review; or

           (4) the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have
           been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.

*6-7; see Mathis, 136 S. Ct. at 2251-52 (noting that the Court’s prior precedent, including

Descamps v. United States, --- U.S. ---, 133 S. Ct. 2276, 2283 (2013), indicated the rule

was not new); United States v. Taylor, --- F. App’x ---, 2016 WL 7093905, at *4, 2016

U.S. App. Lexis 21701, at *12 (10th Cir. Dec. 6, 2016) (concluding that “Mathis did not

announce a new rule,” and citing, inter alia, Dimott, 2016 WL 6068114, at *3, 2016 U.S.

Dist. Lexis 142354, at *6-7). Because Mathis is not retroactively applicable to cases on

collateral review, it does not apply to Petitioner’s case.

       Even if the Supreme Court had given Mathis retroactive effect, Petitioner would not

have been entitled to relief. Mathis is one of a line of cases involving the statutory

interpretation of the term “burglary” as used in section 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). See Mathis,

136 S. Ct. at 2247-50; Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 23 (2005) (“We are, after all,

dealing with an issue of statutory interpretation.”) (citing Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S.

575, 602 (1990)). In Mathis, the Supreme Court recognized the long-standing rule that a

prior conviction will not qualify as an ACCA predicate unless “its elements are the same

as, or narrower than, those of the generic offense.” 136 S. Ct. at 2247. The Court held that

the inclusion of land, water or air vehicles, as well as buildings and structures, in Iowa’s

burglary statute rendered the “locational element” of the crime broader than generic

burglary, which includes only buildings and structures. Id. at 2250. The Supreme Court

held that the Eighth Circuit erred when it affirmed the district court’s use of a modified

categorical approach, which had permitted a review of the record to determine the location

where the burglary took place, because under the ACCA, “it is impermissible for ‘a

particular crime [to] sometimes count towards enhancement and sometimes not, depending

                                               7
Case 2:05-cr-00008-GZS Document 69 Filed 03/16/17 Page 8 of 9                               PageID #: 280



on the facts of the case.’” Id. at 2250-51 (quoting Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575,

601 (1990)).

        Unlike the statute at issue in Mathis, the Massachusetts unarmed burglary statute,

which has not been amended since Petitioner’s 1992 and 1994 offenses, is not broader than

generic burglary. Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266, § 15. The statute provides:

        Whoever breaks and enters a dwelling house in the night time, with the intent
        mentioned in the preceding section, or, having entered with such intent,
        breaks such dwelling house in the night time, the offender not being armed,
        nor arming himself in such house, with a dangerous weapon, nor making an
        assault upon a person lawfully therein, shall be punished by imprisonment in
        the state prison for not more than twenty years and, if he shall have been
        previously convicted of any crime named in this or the preceding section, for
        not less than five years.

Id. The Massachusetts unarmed burglary statute contains a single locational element, in

that the offense must have occurred in a dwelling house. See id.; Taylor, 495 U.S. at 593

& n.6 (noting that “[o]nly a few states retain the common-law definition [of burglary], or

something closely resembling it”) (citing, inter alia, Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 266, § 15).

Because the Massachusetts offense of unarmed burglary is not broader than generic

burglary, Mathis would have been inapplicable to Petitioner’s case, even if the Supreme

Court had held that Mathis had retroactive effect in collateral cases.7


7
  Petitioner has more than the minimum three previous convictions required under section 924(e)(1) for
armed career criminal status, given that his 1992 and 1994 burglary convictions, and the 1986 conviction
of criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon, all qualify as predicates. The 1994 conviction alone
counts as three predicates because, according to the revised presentence investigation report, the indictment
alleged that Petitioner burglarized the homes of three different victims on two dates in 1993. These offenses
were "committed on occasions different from one another,” under section 924(e)(1), and therefore each
qualifies as a predicate offense. See United States v. Mastera, 435 F.3d 56, 59-60 (1st Cir. 2006) ("Whether
two crimes occurred on separate occasions within the meaning of the ACCA 'requires a case-by-case
examination of the totality of the circumstances.'") (quoting United States v. Stearns, 387 F.3d 104, 108
(1st Cir. 2004)). In Stearns, the First Circuit held that two burglaries against the same victim on consecutive
days “each represented a distinct ACCA ‘occurrence.’” 387 F.3d at 109.

       In short, Petitioner does not have a claim under either Johnson or Mathis.

                                    III.   CONCLUSION

       Based on the foregoing analysis, an evidentiary hearing is not warranted under Rule

8 of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Cases. In addition, I recommend that the Court

deny Petitioner’s motion for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. I further recommend

that the Court deny a certificate of appealability pursuant to Rule 11 of the Rules Governing

Section 2255 Cases.
