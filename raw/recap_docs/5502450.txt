                ASSENTED-TO MOTION TO CONTINUE TRIAL

     The United States of America, by and through Assistant

United States Attorney William H. Connolly, hereby requests a

continuance of the trial in the above-captioned matter, currently

scheduled for September 24, 2007.         As grounds, the government

states AUSA William Connolly is expecting the birth of a child on

or about September 27, 2007.      In addition, the parties need

additional time to negotiate a possible plea.             The defendant, who

is not in custody, by and through his attorney, assents to this

request.

     The parties have also agreed to exclude the time between

September 24, 2007, and the new trial date, and request that this

Court find that the ends of justice served by granting the

requested exclusion outweigh the best interest of the public and

the defendant in a speedy trial.

                                  Respectfully Submitted,
                                  United States
                                  By:
