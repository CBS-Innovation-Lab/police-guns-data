                     UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                          DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

                v.                           Case No. 05-cr-52-01-SM

Matthias B. Morgan

                                    ORDER

      Defendant Morgan’s motion to continue the final pretrial conference and

trial is granted (document 9). Trial has been rescheduled for the September

2005 trial period. Defendant Morgan shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights

not later than June 30, 2005. On the filing of such waiver, his continuance shall

be effective.

      The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18

U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would

unreasonably deny defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances.

      Final Pretrial Conference: August 30, 2005 at 11:00 a.m.

      Jury Selection: September 7, 2005 at 9:30 a.m.
