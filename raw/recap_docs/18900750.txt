UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
United States of America
v. Criminal No. O9-cr-16l-Ol-SM

Alan Houghton

ORDER OF DETENTION PENDING TRIAL

In accordance with Section 3142(f) of the Bail Reform Act,
18 U.S.C. §§ 3141 §§ §§g;, a hearing was conducted today for the
purpose of determining whether to detain defendant, Alan
Houghton, who has been indicted on five counts of a 9-count
indictment with knowingly and unlawfully distributing cocaine,
and participating in a conspiracy to distribute more than fifty
grams of cocaine,

Under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(b), a court, in making a
determination regarding detention, must evaluate the risk of the
defendant's flight, the risk to the safety of any other person,
and the risk to the safety of the community. In circumstances
when detention is not mandated by the court, the court is
nonetheless empowered to impose conditions on release. 18 U.S.C.
§ 3142(€).

Pursuant to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) a court,

in assessing the risks noted in 18 U.S.C. § 3142(b), shall
consider the following: (1) the nature and circumstances of the
offense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence as to guilt;

(3) the history and characteristics of the accused, including
family ties, past history, financial resources and employment;
and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or
the community that would be posed by a release.

During the course of a hearing conducted pursuant to 18
U.S.C. § 3142, the government typically retains the burden of
persuading the court that “‘no condition or combination of
conditions will reasonably assure' the defendant's presence at
trial.” United States v. Perez~Franco, 839 F.2d 867, 870 (lst

Cir. 1988)(quoting United States v. Palmer-Contreras, 835 F.Zd

15, 17-18 (1st Cir. 1987)); United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d
789, 793 (1st Cir. 1991). For its part, the government is

required to offer clear and convincing evidence of dangerousness;
and a preponderance of the evidence to prove risk of flight, §§§
Patriarca, 948 F.2d at 792-93. Facts necessary to find that no
combination will reasonably assure the safety of any person and
the community require satisfaction of the “clear and convincing”

standard. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f)(2).

In specific instances, delineated in 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e), a
presumption arises that no condition or combination of conditions
will reasonably assure the appearance of a defendant and the
safety of the community. Among the instances where a presumption
arises is the situation where,

the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to

believe that the person committed an offense for which a

maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is

prescribed in the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801

et seq)

18 U.S.C. § 3142(e).

In the case at hand, the indictment itself constitutes
probable cause to believe that the offenses charged have been
committed and that the defendant has committed them. Further,
the offenses charged against the defendant are ones for which a
maximum term of imprisonment is ten years or more, as prescribed
in the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 801 et seg. §e§
United States v. Dillon, 938 F.2d 1412, 1417 (1st Cir. 1991).
Thus, Section 3142(e)'s rebuttable presumption that “no condition
or combination of conditions will reasonably assure [defendant's]
appearance . . . and the safety of the community . . .” is
triggered in this case. ee 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e), (f); 21 U.S.C.

§ 841(b)(1)(C); see also United States v. Vargas, 804 F.Zd 157,

162-63 (1st Cir. 1986).
In order to counter the statutory presumption triggered, the

defendant must present evidence which demonstrates that “what is

true in genera1 is not true in [his] particular case.” United
States v. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 384 (1st Cir. 1985). Notably,
the burden is one of production, not of persuasion. ;Q; at 380-
81.

Here, I find that the defendant fails to rebut the
presumption with regard to risk of flight and danger to the
community. Specifically, the government proffers what appears to
be a strong case. The defendant has strong ties to Rhode Island
and ethereal ties to New Hampshire. He collects SSDI and has
serious health issues. Aside from the present charges involving
crack and powder cocaine, the defendant has a prior drug felony
conviction which is 10 years old but which triggers the filing of
an enhanced penalty information. Thus he faces a minimum of 20
years in prison if convicted on the present charges.

The defendant here is the type of individual Congress
envisioned when it established the statutory presumption.

Aside from the presumption imposed in this case by 18 U.S.C.

§ 3142(e), I am satisfied from the representations offered during

the hearing that no condition or combination of conditions will
reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant.

Upon full consideration of the detailed arguments offered by
the government and defense, I am satisfied that the defendant has
not rebutted the presumption that he poses a serious risk of
flight and a danger to the community.

Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the defendant Alan Houghton
be detained pending trial.

The defendant is committed to the custody of the Attorney
General or his designated representative for confinement in a
corrections facility separate, to the extent practicable, from
persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody
pending appeal. The defendant shall be afforded a reasonable
opportunity for private consultation with defense counsel. On
order of a court of the United States or on request of an
attorney for the Government, the person in charge of the
corrections facility shall deliver the defendant to the United
States Marshal for the purpose of an appearance in connection
with a court proceeding.

SO ORDERED.
