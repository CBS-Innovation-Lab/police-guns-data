        MEMORANDUM OF DECISION AND ORDER ON SENTENCE

      On April 5, 2012, the Defendant, Nicholas Emond, entered a guilty plea to a

single count of Providing False or Fictitious Information to a Federal Firearms

Licensee in Acquiring a Firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(a)(6) and 924(a)(2).

The issue before the Court is whether United States Sentencing Guideline

§ 2K2.1(a)(6) applies because the Defendant was a prohibited person when he

committed the offense.

      The Defendant challenges the Government’s factual basis for the elevated

base offense level and brings constitutional challenges under the Second and Fifth

Amendments. He argues that § 922(g)(3) is unconstitutional under the Second

Amendment facially and as applied to him, deprives him of his fundamental right to

bear arms without due process of law, and is unconstitutionally vague. For the

reasons that follow, the Court finds that the elevated base offense level applies. The

Court also holds that § 922(g)(3) is facially constitutional, constitutional as applied

to the Defendant, and not unconstitutionally vague.

                                         DISCUSSION

          A. Whether the Enhancement Applies

      USSG § 2K2.1 applies to prohibited firearm transactions including 18 U.S.C.

§ 922(a)(6). Section 2K2.1(a)(6) sets the base offense level for prohibited firearm

transactions at 14 “if the defendant (A) was a prohibited person at the time the

defendant committed the instant offense . . . .” The sentencing guideline definition

for “prohibited person” refers to any person described in 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g) &

922(n). U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 2K2.1 cmt. n.3. Section 922(g)(3)

makes it a crime for a person “who is an unlawful user of or addicted to any

controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21

U.S.C. 802))” to possess a firearm.

      The Government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the

evidence that the Defendant engaged in (1) regular drug use, (2) for a long period of

time, (3) proximate to or contemporaneous to the offense. United States v.

Caparotta, 676 F.3d 213, 216 (1st Cir. 2012); United States v. Marceau, 554 F.3d 24,

30 (1st Cir. 2009). The First Circuit has explained that the term “unlawful user” in

section 922(g)(3) “requires a ‘temporal nexus between the gun possession and

regular drug use.’” Marceau, 554 F.3d at 30 (citing United States v. Edwards, 540

F.3d 1156, 1162 (10th Cir. 2008)).1 In making its determination of whether the


1     The Code of Federal Regulations defines an unlawful user as:

      A person who uses a controlled substance and has lost the power of self-control with
      reference to the use of controlled substance . . . . Such use is not limited to the use of
      drugs on a particular day, or within a matter of days or weeks before, but rather that
      the unlawful use has occurred recently enough to indicate that the individual is
      actively engaged in such conduct. A person may be an unlawful current user of a


                                                  2

enhanced base offense level applies, “[a] sentencing court is entitled to rely on

circumstantial evidence and draw plausible inferences therefrom.” Marceau, 554

F.3d at 32 (citations omitted).

       The Defendant faces sentencing on a charge that he induced Jessica Bolster

to make a false statement to a federally licensed firearms dealer in connection with

the purchase of a Ruger 9 mm semi-automatic pistol from the Kittery Trading Post

on February 26, 2011. At a conference of counsel held on September 14, 2011, the

Government and counsel for the Defendant stipulated that the record for purposes

of the Court’s determination of whether the Defendant was an unlawful user at the

time of the offense is limited to the Revised Presentence Investigation Report and

the Government’s exhibits.

       From the stipulated record, the Court finds that the Defendant admitted

during an April 28, 2011 interview with an ATF agent that:

              he met Jessica Bolster (the mother of his friend) when he moved into
               her residence approximately two weeks prior to the straw purchase;

              he has been a user of illegal opiates since 2007;

              he and Jessica Bolster shared a dependence/addiction to heroin;

              he spent $8,000 on heroin in one week which Bolster and he used;

              he was unsure whether he had unlawfully used a controlled substance
               on the day of the straw purchase, but Bolster used heroin daily and
               had used heroin that day; and

       controlled substance even though the substance is not being used at the precise time
       the person seeks to acquire a firearm or receives or possesses a firearm. An inference
       of current use may be drawn from evidence of a recent use or possession of a
       controlled substance or a pattern of use or possession that reasonably covers the
       present time . . . .

27 C.F.R. § 478.11.

               because of his addictions, he was not ready to be a good father to his
                children.

Gov’t Ex. 3. During a taped “recap” conducted after the interview on April 28, 2011,

the Defendant stated: “I have a current issue with addiction. But at this point, sober

– technically. I’m not using any street drugs and I’m suffering a great deal due to

that too. But this point it’s do or die man. Gotta give up the drugs or lose the most

important things to me in my life and that’s good people that care about me.” Gov’t

Ex. 4.

         The record includes a report of a proffer interview with Bolster conducted on

January 3, 2012. In that interview, Bolster told an ATF agent that:

               the Defendant uses cocaine, opioids, and heroin;

               the Defendant misuses prescription drugs;

               she used heroin with the Defendant;

               the Defendant brought a “softball sized bag of heroin powder” to
                Bolster’s residence 2-3 weeks before the straw purchase and gave
                Bolster about 3 grams of the powder;

               although she was high at the time, she believed that the Defendant
                snorted some of the heroin with her as she was using it; and

               she believed that she had seen the Defendant snort but not shoot
                heroin.

Gov’t Ex. 1.

         The record also includes a March 14, 2011 ex parte domestic violence petition

from the mother of the Defendant’s two children, Brittany Small. Gov’t Ex. 2.




                                            4
Case 2:12-cr-00044-NT Document 41 Filed 10/17/12 Page 5 of 15                       PageID #: 111



According to the petition, Small alleged at the hearing2 that the Defendant had

been using heroin since his release from prison one month prior. Id. The Revised

Presentence Investigation Report confirms that on February 8, 2011, the Defendant

was sentenced to twelve days for his conviction for resisting arrest. Revised

Presentence Investigation Report ¶¶ 33-34.3 The record also includes the resulting

protection order, dated March 24, 2011, which states that the court found that the

Defendant’s conduct constituted a credible threat to Small because of “ongoing drug

use.” Gov’t Ex. 2.

       The Defendant points out that Bolster’s own drug issues and Small’s

potential bias against her ex-boyfriend make them unreliable as witnesses. The

Court finds, however, that their descriptions of the Defendant’s drug use during the

second half of February of 2011 corroborate each other and are corroborated by the

Defendant’s own admissions to the ATF agent in April of 2011.

       By the stipulated exhibits, the Government has shown by a preponderance of

evidence that the Defendant engaged in regular use of illegal drugs over a long

period of time. While there is no direct evidence in the record of the Defendant’s

drug use on the day of the straw purchase, the evidence reasonably supports the

inference that the Defendant was using heroin sufficiently proximate in time to the

offense for the enhanced base offense level to apply. The Defendant claimed that he


2       It is unclear from the record when the hearing occurred, but the Final Order of Protection
was entered on March 24, 2011.
3       Paragraph 7 of the Revised Presentence Investigation Report incorrectly reports that the
Defendant admitted in an interview with an ATF agent that he used heroin daily, “including the
day” of the gun purchase. The Defendant clarified at sentencing that he did not recall using on the
day of the purchase, and the Government conceded that the ATF interview report reflects that the
Defendant told the agent that Bolster used heroin daily, including the day of the purchase.


                                                  5
Case 2:12-cr-00044-NT Document 41 Filed 10/17/12 Page 6 of 15          PageID #: 112



met Bolster only two weeks before the straw purchase and admitted that he had

used heroin with her. Both the Defendant and Bolster spoke about using a large

amount of heroin, which Bolster said occurred two to three weeks before the straw

purchase. Small’s allegations also pinpointed the Defendant’s use of heroin as

starting after his release from jail, which would have occurred sometime in mid-

February of 2011, shortly before the straw purchase. The Defendant’s own

admission to the ATF agent that he was sober on April 28, 2011 but that he was

suffering allows the Court to draw the inference that the Defendant was in

withdrawal in April of 2011. There is sufficient evidence that the Defendant was

using street drugs, specifically heroin, from mid-February into March of 2011.

      The evidence suggests that the Defendant had “lost the power of self-control”

and was “actively engaged” in drug use around the time of the straw purchase. See

Caparotta, 676 F.3d at 220 (defendant’s admission of regular use of marijuana

within one month of possession of stolen firearms plus text messages seeking drugs

three days before and after the date he stole firearms was “ample evidence for the

district court to conclude that he was a ‘prohibited person’”); Marceau, 554 F.3d at

30 (evidence established defendant was a “prohibited person” where defendant

admitted regular marijuana use in the days before the robbery and that the robbery

was the first step in a plan to sell the stolen firearms to get more money for drugs).

The Court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Defendant was a

prohibited person at the time that he committed the offense and concludes that the

applicable base offense level is 14.

            B. Constitutional Challenges

        Section 922(g)(3) prohibits unlawful drug users from possessing firearms,

thereby directly implicating their Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.

Since the Defendant’s base offense level is being elevated because he is an unlawful

drug user who may not possess a firearm under § 922(g)(3), his Second Amendment

right to keep and bear arms is indirectly implicated by his sentence.

                      1.        Facial Challenge

        The Defendant brings a facial constitutional challenge to § 922(g)(3), arguing

that it deprives him of his right to bear arms and must survive strict scrutiny. The

Second Amendment of the United States Constitution4 establishes an individual,

fundamental right to bear arms. District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008).

In Heller, while holding that the Second Amendment confers an individual right to

keep and bear arms, the Supreme Court also explained that the individual right to

bear arms is not unlimited:

        From Blackstone through the 19th-century cases, commentators and
        courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and
        carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for
        whatever purpose . . . nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast
        doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by
        felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms
        in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws
        imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.




4       “A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the
people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.” U.S. Const. amend. II.

Id. at 625. In a footnote, the Court added: “We identify these presumptively lawful

regulatory measures only as examples; our list does not purport to be exhaustive.”

Id. at 627 n.26.

      The Defendant asks the Court to apply strict scrutiny to § 922(g)(3), which

would require that the Government prove that § 922(g)(3) is narrowly tailored to a

compelling state interest. However, the Defendant has provided no case law where

a court has applied strict scrutiny to § 922(g)(3). The First Circuit has applied

intermediate scrutiny to § 922(g)(9), which prohibits firearm possession by

individuals convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors. United States v. Booker,

644 F.3d 12, 25 (1st Cir. 2011). The Fourth, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits

have all applied intermediate scrutiny to § 922(g)(3), requiring a substantial

relation to an important government objective. See United States v. Carter, 669 F.3d

411 (4th Cir. 2011); United States v. Yancey, 621 F.3d 681 (7th Cir. 2010); United

States v. Seay, 620 F.3d 919 (8th Cir. 2010); United States v. Dugan, 657 F.3d 998

(9th Cir. 2011); cf. United States v. Richard, 350 F. App’x 252 (10th Cir. 2009)

(summarily upholding § 922(g)(3) without specifying a level of scrutiny).

      The Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits have also all upheld §

922(g)(3) against Second Amendment challenges. See United States v. Patterson,

431 F.3d 832, 835-36 (5th Cir. 2005) (upholding § 922(g)(3)’s constitutionality under

pre-Heller Fifth Circuit decision recognizing individual right to bear arms under

Second Amendment); Yancey, 621 F.3d 681 at 687; Seay, 620 F.3d at 925; Dugan,

657 F.3d at 999-1000; Richard, 350 F. App'x at 260; cf. Carter, 669 F.3d at 421

(strongly suggesting that the Fourth Circuit will join other circuits upholding §

922(g)(3) but remanding to develop the record).

       In Yancey, the Seventh Circuit, applying intermediate scrutiny, found that §

922(g)(3) is substantially related to an important governmental objective. It

recognized that § 922(g)(3)’s broad objective of “suppressing armed violence” is

“without doubt an important one.” Id. at 684. The Seventh Circuit found that

“habitual drug users, like the mentally ill, are more likely to have difficulty

exercising self-control, making it dangerous for them to possess deadly firearms,”

and that “studies amply demonstrate the connection between chronic drug abuse

and violent crime, and illuminate the nexus between Congress’s attempt to keep

firearms away from habitual drug abusers and its goal of reducing violent crime.”

Id. at 685-86 (citing significant academic research linking drug use and violence).

The Seventh Circuit also noted that unlike a person with a felony conviction or a

person who has been committed to a psychiatric hospital, a drug abuser may regain

his ability to possess a firearm by not using drugs. Id. at 686-87.

       In Seay, the Eighth Circuit agreed: “Nothing in [the defendant’s] argument

convinces us that we should depart company from every other court to examine §

922(g)(3) following Heller. Further, § 922(g)(3) has the same historical pedigree as

other portions of § 922(g) which are repeatedly upheld by numerous courts since

Heller.” Id. at 925.

       In Dugan, the Ninth Circuit held the same, explaining that:

       we see the same amount of danger in allowing habitual drug users to
       traffic in firearms as we see in allowing felons and mentally ill people



                                           9
Case 2:12-cr-00044-NT Document 41 Filed 10/17/12 Page 10 of 15           PageID #: 116



      to do so. Habitual drug users, like career criminals and the mentally
      ill, more likely will have difficulty exercising self-control, particularly
      when they are under the influence of controlled substances.

Id. at 999.

      The Court sees no reason to depart from these circuits’ reasoning and

conclusions. Preventing gun violence is an important government objective and the

Defendant concedes as much in his Sentencing Memorandum. Def.’s Sentencing

Mem. 8 (ECF No. 28). As each of the circuit courts upholding § 922(g)(3) have

recognized, there are demonstrable links between unlawful drug use and violence.

The Court is not persuaded by the Defendant’s argument that § 922(g)(3) is

overinclusive because it prohibits possession by unlawful drug users who do not

pose a risk of gun violence and underinclusive because it does not prohibit

possession by those who drink alcohol or use other impairing substances not covered

by § 922(g)(3).

      In Carter, the Fourth Circuit addressed and rejected this same argument.

The Fourth Circuit held that § 922(g)(3) is not overinclusive because the Supreme

Court made clear in Heller that some categorical prohibitions on gun possession are

presumptively constitutional, and “Congress is not limited to case-by-case

exclusions of persons who have been shown to be untrustworthy with weapons.”

Carter, 669 F.3d at 420 (quoting United States v. Skoein, 614 F.3d 638, 641 (7th Cir.

2010) (en banc)). The Fourth Circuit dismissed an underinclusivity objection to §

922(g)(3) as a disagreement with Congress’s reasonable choice to link § 922(g)(3) to

the Controlled Substances Act. Id. at 421.




                                          10
Case 2:12-cr-00044-NT Document 41 Filed 10/17/12 Page 11 of 15                     PageID #: 117



       At the sentencing hearing, the Government introduced studies and academic

research which establish a connection between drug use and violent crime.5 The

studies submitted by the Government, the case law that addresses this question,

the legislative history behind § 922(g)(3), and common sense support the conclusion

that prohibiting unlawful drug users from possessing firearms is substantially

related to the important government objective of reducing gun violence. And, as

other circuits have noted, unlike § 922(g)’s prohibition of firearm possession by

felons and those who have been committed because of mental illness, § 922(g)(3)’s

prohibition on firearm possession by unlawful drug users is a temporary restriction

that lasts only as long as the person continues using drugs.

                     2.       As Applied Challenge

       The Defendant also argues that applying § 922(g)(3) to him does not

substantially serve an important government objective. The Court disagrees. The

Defendant fits comfortably within the category of people that Congress wished to

prevent from possessing firearms. There is undisputed evidence in the record that

the Defendant has unlawfully used drugs since he was 14, including marijuana,

prescription opiates, and heroin. By his own admission to the ATF agent, the

Defendant has been struggling with drug addiction for years. The Defendant was

convicted of unlawful trafficking in scheduled drugs in 2005.

       Eight months after the straw purchase, the Defendant was in possession of a

semi-automatic rifle that he could not recall purchasing because he was high on

heroin at the time of purchase. The Defendant has ten prior adult criminal

convictions, and numerous run-ins with police. Several of these convictions and

incidents involved violence, including resisting arrest, assaults and stalking. As

discussed earlier in this opinion, § 922(g)(3)’s objective is to keep guns out of the

hands of individuals with diminished self-control and an increased risk of violent

conduct. The Defendant’s record of drug use and criminal conduct shows him to be

such an individual.

                     3.        Due Process Challenge

       An individual may not be deprived of his fundamental right to bear and keep

arms without due process of law.6 United States v. Rehlander, 666 F.3d 45, 48 (1st

Cir. 2012).

       Although the right established in Heller is a qualified right, the right
       to possess arms (among those not properly disqualified) is no longer
       something that can be withdrawn by government on a permanent and
       irrevocable basis without due process. Ordinarily, to work a permanent
       or prolonged loss of a constitutional liberty or property interest, an
       adjudicatory hearing, including a right to offer and test evidence if
       facts are in dispute, is required.

Id. at 48. In Rehlander, the First Circuit held that § 922(g)(4), which prohibits a

person who “has been committed to a mental institution” from possessing a firearm,

could not include persons who had been hospitalized under Maine’s emergency, ex

parte procedure for involuntary psychiatric hospitalization. The First Circuit


6      The Fifth Amendment provides: “No person shall . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property,
without due process of law . . . .” U.S. Const. amend V.


                                                  12
Case 2:12-cr-00044-NT Document 41 Filed 10/17/12 Page 13 of 15          PageID #: 119



concluded that this process provided insufficient process to permanently deprive a

person of her Second Amendment rights. The First Circuit held that Maine’s

emergency procedure is procedurally inadequate because there is no pre-admission

adversary hearing or pre-admission finding by an independent judicial officer, and

the individual is not provided with counsel. Id. at 48-49. The First Circuit added

that Maine’s emergency procedure might be adequate if it resulted in only a

temporary suspension of the right to bear arms pending further proceedings, or if

the hospitalized person had a later opportunity to recover her Second Amendment

rights. The First Circuit contrasted Maine’s emergency procedure with Maine’s

involuntary commitment statute, which permits involuntary commitment after an

adversarial hearing and provides the patient with counsel, the opportunity to

testify, and the opportunity to call and cross-examine witnesses. Id. at 48.

      The Defendant argues that his status as an “unlawful user of drugs” has not

been adjudicated, and he has not been provided with notice or an opportunity to be

heard regarding the applicability of § 922(g)(3) to him. Pursuant to Federal Rule of

Criminal Procedure 32(e)(2), the Defendant was provided with a presentence report

summarizing the results of probation’s presentence investigation conducted

pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(c). The Report notified him of its

recommendation that his base offense level be set at 14 because he was a prohibited

person at the time of the offense. The Defendant made objections in writing to the

presentence report and the base offense level, and probation’s subsequent Revised

Presentence Investigation Report and Addendum to the Presentence Report

explains the Defendant’s unresolved objections. After briefing was completed on the

Defendant’s factual and constitutional challenges to the recommended base offense

level, the Court held a conference of counsel to ask the parties whether they wished

to have an evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether the Defendant is a

prohibited person under § 2K2.1(a)(6). The Court reminded Defendant’s counsel

that he could introduce his own evidence at the evidentiary hearing to contradict

the Government’s evidence that the Defendant was using drugs at the time of the

straw purchase. Nonetheless, counsel for the Defendant waived an evidentiary

hearing and both parties stipulated that the Revised Presentence Investigation

Report and the Government’s exhibits would constitute the factual record for

purposes of the Court’s determinations on the Defendant’s factual and as-applied

constitutional challenges. The Court asked the Defendant at sentencing if he

understood his right to an evidentiary hearing to contest the Government’s evidence

or introduce his own evidence. The Defendant told the Court that he understood his

right to a hearing and that he had an adequate opportunity to discuss the matter

with his counsel. Defense counsel and the Defendant declined the opportunity to put

on evidence to challenge the Government’s evidence.

      The Defendant has been provided with notice and an opportunity to be heard

on whether § 922(g)(3) applies to him and his status as an unlawful drug user has

been adjudicated by this Court. The Court concludes that the process that the

Defendant has received on the issue of whether he is a prohibited person for

purposes of § 2K2.1(a)(6) is sufficient under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth

Amendment.

                   4.      Vagueness Challenge

         Finally, the Defendant argues that § 922(g)(3) is unconstitutionally vague.

“In order to avoid unconstitutional vagueness, courts have held that the critical

term ‘unlawful user’ requires a ‘temporal nexus between the gun possession and

regular drug use.’ Refined further, an ‘unlawful user’ is one who engages in ‘regular

use over a long period of time proximate to or contemporaneous with the possession

of the firearm.’” Marceau, 554 F.3d at 30 (quoting Edwards, 540 F.3d at 1162 and

United States v. McCowan, 469 F.3d 386, 392 n.4 (5th Cir. 2006)). With this

narrowing construction, § 922(g)(3) is not unconstitutionally vague. A reasonable

person would understand that the Defendant’s heroin dependency and use

proximate in time to the offense is covered by § 922(g)(3).

   II.      CONCLUSION

         The Court finds that the Defendant is a prohibited person under § 922(g)(3)

and the base offense level is 14 pursuant to USSG § 2K2.1(a)(6). The Court

concludes that § 922(g)(3) is constitutional on its face and as applied to the

Defendant, the Defendant was not deprived of his Second Amendment right to bear

arms without due process of law, and § 922(g)(3) is not unconstitutionally vague.

SO ORDERED.
