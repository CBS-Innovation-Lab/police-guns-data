                  IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                   FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND

JOHN KIMBROUGH

v.                                                  Case No: 1:06CROOl16-015


UNITED STATES OF AMERICA



           PETITIONER'S REPLY TO THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE
                 IN OPPOSITION TO HIS 28 U.S.C.      §§ 2255


     NOW COMES, the petitioner appearing pro se in the above matter,
and would respectfully request that the Honorable Court grant, this
his . Motion to Vacate and his Reply to the Government's Response and
would show the Court as follows:


                          PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
     The petitioner filed the instant petition for relief on March
3, 2008, and did not file a direct appeal or any prior post-conviction
motions pertaining to the sentence and/or conviction.
                                ARGUMENT I.

     THE DEFENSE COUNSEL WAS CLEARLY INEFFECTIVE FOR FAILING TO
 OBJECT TO THE MANDATORY USE OF THE CAREER OFFENDER GUIDELINES AND
           THE CRACK COCAINE 100 TO 1 MANDATORY RATIO
                          PURSUANT TO   § 3553(a)
      Case 1:06-cr-00116-S-LDA   Document 48   Filed 05/05/2008   Page 2 of 4


     The petitioner contends that the defense counsel was ineffective
 for failing to challenge and object to the use of the 'mandatory'
career offender guidelines and the 'crack cocaine 100 to 1 ratio', which
 in light of Booker are advisory, which resulted into a higher penalty
and there is clearly a probability that the outcome would have been
different. See Strickland v. Washington , 466 u.S.         668,6 87-~8    (1984);
Glover v. United States, 531 US 198 (2001). The government has a mis-
understanding or misapplication of the facts of the case and/or the issue
presented.
       The government incorrectly han gs unto the 'fact' that the Honorable
Court departed from the mandatory guideline range for due to the career
offender status in light of the petitioner's learning disability. The
petitioner is well aware of this fact and grateful, but the error is not
here. The departure and/or the 'below guideline sentence'of 150 months
was for the learning disability only pursuant to § 3553(a) based upon
 the Court's own discretion, not for any other factor and not based upon
 the fact that the petitioner was considered a career offender. The sentence
was not based upon the fact that Mr. Kimbrough was a career offender and -
 that his penalty/mandatory guideline was increased both horizontally and
vertically pursuant to the pre-Rooker scheme and his Ofeense level 31,
Criminal history Category V was the starting point for calculating the
- petitioner's Base Offense Level. The Honorable Court even in the mandatory
scheme could have departed for the learning disability pursuant to Koon
v. United States, 518 US 81(1996); therefore, the career offender guideline
§ 4Bl.2 was treated as mandatory, because the court did not give a lesser
sentence based on 'career offender status' alone and gave the petitioner
a mandatory Base offense level in addition to the 'learning disability'
departure and/or outside guideline sentence.

     Secondly, the crack cocaine guidelines are 'advisory' just as
any other guidelines and the 100 to 1 ratio is not mandatory. It is
clear that the ratio and Congress' action in allowing/amending the same
constitute a change of direction in relation to the cocaine versus crack
disparity, which the U.S. Sentencing Commission has attempted to change
for years prior to the 2007 amendment. The crack cocaine scare has
run its course and it is obvious that only African-Americans are the
only nationality being given outrageous penalties for personal use amounts
of cocaine base when it is chemically the exact same drug. Water is a
a perfect analogy. Water can be converted into ice, ice can be converted
into vapor and vice-versa, so "does the identity/substance change because
the form changes?"Surely Not! The petitioner further contends that the
defense counsel should have objected to the use of the 100 to 1 ratio,
and the 10 year mandatory minimum meets the requirements of § 3553(a)
which dictates that the sentence be "sufficient, but not greater than
necessary."
    WHEREFORE, for all of the above reasons and in the interest of justice
and fairness, the petitioner respectfully request that the Honorable
Court remand the case for an evidentiary hearing and/or remand the case
for resentencing.

                                                          Respectfully,
