                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                        DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                   Criminal No. 11-cr-034-01-PB

Carlos Perez


                     ORDER OF DETENTION PENDING TRIAL


     In accordance with 18 U.S.C. ' 3142(f), a hearing was conducted

on March 18, 2011, for the purpose of determining whether to detain

the defendant.      Defendant filed under seal a motion for release in

advance of the hearing.      The court issued its detention order orally

from the bench.      This written order summarizes (and partially

amends) the court's findings and rulings from the bench.


                               Legal Standards

     Section 3142(f) of the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. '' 3141-3156,

"does not authorize a detention hearing whenever the government

thinks detention would be desirable, but rather limits such hearings"

to the circumstances listed in 18 U.S.C. '' 3142(f)(1) and (f)(2).

United States v. Ploof, 851 F.2d 7, 10 (1st Cir. 1988).         In this case,

the government invokes ' 3142(f)(1)(E), asserting that a detention

hearing is warranted because the defendant is charged with a felony

that is not otherwise a crime of violence but involves possession

of a firearm.

     In this case, the defendant is charged by indictment with the

crime of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in

violation of 18 U.S.C. ' 922(g)(1).       That charge satisfies the

parameters of ' 3142(f)(1)(E), and, accordingly, the detention

hearing was appropriately requested.

     Pursuant to ' 3142(f), the court must determine whether any

condition or combination of conditions set forth in subsection (c)

will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant ("risk of

flight") and the safety of any other person and the safety of the

community ("dangerousness").     18 U.S.C. ' 3142(f); United States v.

Patriarca, 948 F.2d 789, 791 (1st Cir. 1991).         In making this

determination, the court must consider the following: (1) the nature

and circumstances of the offense charged; (2) the weight of the

evidence as to guilt; (3) the history and characteristics of the

accused, including family ties, past history, financial resources

and employment; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to

any person or the community that would be posed by a release.          18

U.S.C. ' 3142(g).

     During the course of a hearing conducted pursuant to 18 U.S.C.

' 3142, the government has the burden of persuading the court that

no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure (1)

the defendant's presence at trial, United States v. Perez-Franco,

839 F.2d 867, 870 (1st Cir. 1988); or (2) the safety of another or


                                    2

the community.   Patriarca, 948 F.2d at 793.       For its part, the

government is required to prove risk of flight by a preponderance

of the evidence and to establish dangerousness by clear and

convincing evidence.    See id. at 792-93.

     In specific instances, delineated in 18 U.S.C. ' 3142(e), a

presumption arises that no condition or combination of conditions

will reasonably assure the appearance of a defendant and the safety

of the community.    Once the presumption is invoked, the defendant

need only produce "some evidence" to rebut it.         United States v.

Dillon, 938 F.2d 1412, 1416 (1st Cir. 1991); United States v. Jessup,

757 F.2d 378, 384 (1st Cir. 1985). "When a defendant produces such

evidence, however, the presumption does not disappear.         The burden

of persuasion remains on the government and the rebutted presumption

retains evidentiary weight."      Dillon, 938 F.2d at 1416.


                         Findings and Rulings

     The government relied on the nature of the charge against the

defendant to argue that section 3142(e)'s rebuttable presumption

that "no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably

assure [the defendant's] appearance . . . and the safety of the

community" is triggered in this case.     See 18 U.S.C. ' 3142(e)(2)(A).

The defendant did not dispute the applicability of the rebuttable

presumption.   Although the court referred to the presumption during




                                    3
       Case 1:11-cr-00034-PB Document 11 Filed 03/21/11 Page 4 of 6




the hearing, on closer examination, the court does not agree that

the presumption applies in this case.

     Nonetheless, even without the statutory presumption, the

court's conclusion is the same.         For the reasons stated below and

on the record, and after considering the proffers of counsel,

defendant's motion for release, and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.

' 3142(g), the court finds that defendant's release, even on strict

conditions, presents an unacceptable risk of danger to the community.

     Specifically, with respect to dangerousness, the court weighed

the following:

          The nature and circumstances of the offense charged.          The

          underlying charge alleges that defendant was a felon in

          possession of multiple firearms.

          The weight of the evidence against the defendant.             The

          weight of the evidence against the defendant is extremely

          strong.    When questioned by the ATF agent, the defendant

          admitted that he possessed the firearms in question.

          Defendant's criminal record.         The defendant's record is

          extensive and reveals, as described by the government, a

          "continuous stream" of criminal conduct.          Recently,

          defendant's crimes have been more serious.          Since 2008,

          defendant has been convicted of burglary, multiple




                                    4
       Case 1:11-cr-00034-PB Document 11 Filed 03/21/11 Page 5 of 6




          forgeries, and a violation of probation.          He has served

          jail time on these charges and received suspended prison

          sentences as well.

          Defendant's drug use.     Defendant has a history of drug use

          that appears to have gone untreated, and it may be more

          serious than defendant has admitted to pretrial services.

          Unstable Residence.      Although the defendant has a

          temporary residence available to him, it is clear that the

          situation is far from stable.        Defendant's former

          girlfriend (and mother of his two children) is willing but

          reluctant to permit defendant to stay with her.             She is

          no longer in a relationship with defendant and does not

          want to pursue a future with him.        She has described her

          relationship with defendant as "tumultuous" and having

          caused her "undue stress."       Recently, defendant

          threatened suicide if he could not be in a relationship

          with her.    The unstable residence coupled with

          defendant's history of crime presents a significant risk

          factor.

     On the basis of the foregoing, the court finds that the

government, without the benefit of the presumption, met its burden

to prove that there are no conditions or combination of conditions

that will reasonably assure the safety of the community were the court

to release the defendant.

      Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the defendant be detained

pending trial.


      The defendant is committed to the custody of the Attorney

General or his designated representative for confinement in a

corrections facility, to be held separately, to the extent

practicable, from persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held

in custody pending appeal.      The defendant shall be afforded a

reasonable opportunity for private consultation with defense

counsel.   On order of a court of the United States or on request of

an attorney for the government, the person in charge of the

corrections facility shall deliver the defendant to the United States

Marshal for the purpose of appearing in connection with court

proceedings.

      SO ORDERED.
