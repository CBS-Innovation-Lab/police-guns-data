               RECOMMENDED DECISION ON 28 U.S.C. § 2255 MOTION

       In this action, Petitioner Robert Kelly Carter moves, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255, to

vacate, set aside or correct his sentence. (Motion, ECF No. 57.) Following a guilty plea, Petitioner

was convicted of possession of firearms by a convicted felon; the Court sentenced Petitioner to

120 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release. (Judgment, ECF No. 42 at

1-3; Indictment, ECF No. 14.) Petitioner did not appeal from the judgment.

       Petitioner asserts ineffective assistance of counsel based on the following grounds:

(1) failure to move to suppress evidence from a search that petitioner contends was

unconstitutional (Motion at 8); (2) failure to file a notice of appeal and failure to pursue an appeal

(id. at 4); (3) failure to investigate adequately a prior conviction that formed the basis for a

sentencing enhancement (id. at 5); (4) failure to investigate adequately bases for mitigation at

sentencing (id. at 6); and (5) failure to challenge adequately the requirement that Petitioner

participate in sex offender treatment as a special condition of supervised release (id. at 8).

       The Government filed a response, and requested dismissal. (Response, ECF No. 71 at 1.)

Petitioner retained counsel, who filed Petitioner’s reply. (Reply, ECF No. 79 at 33.)

       Following a review of Petitioner’s motion and the Government’s request for dismissal, I

recommend pursuant to Rule 7 of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings, the Court allow

Petitioner twenty days to submit admissible evidence that Petitioner believes corroborates his

communications with his counsel regarding the notice of appeal. I also recommend that if

Petitioner files any such evidence, the Court permit the Government to file a response to

Petitioner’s submission within 20 days of the filing. I further recommend the Court deny

Petitioner’s motion as to the remaining claims.

                  I.      FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

       In 2012, Petitioner’s probation under a Kentucky sentence was transferred from Kentucky

to Maine. (Motion at 19; Kentucky state court petition, ECF No. 57-8 at 3, 13.) Petitioner,

therefore, was on probation at the time of the events that gave rise to the federal criminal

prosecution.

       According to the prosecution version, which Petitioner, in his plea colloquy, told the Court

he did not dispute, one of Petitioner’s female friends contacted Petitioner’s probation officer on

September 18, 2013, and told him that Petitioner possessed at least two handguns at his residence

in Lisbon, Maine, where Petitioner lived alone. (Prosecution Version, ECF No. 24 at 1; Plea Tr.,

ECF No. 54 at 13-14.) Later that day, law enforcement and the probation officer conducted a

search of Petitioner’s residence, pursuant to Petitioner’s probation conditions. (Prosecution

Version at 1.) After the officers told Petitioner they intended to conduct a search based on the

friend’s report, Petitioner told the officers where they would find the guns; officers found the guns

in the place identified by both Petitioner and the friend. (Id. at 1-2.)

       Petitioner was indicted in November 2013 for a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), for

knowingly possessing two firearms after having been convicted of the following three crimes:



                                                  2
Case 2:13-cr-00196-NT Document 80 Filed 11/10/16 Page 3 of 24                      PageID #: 588



(1) residential entry in Indiana (2001 conviction); (2) sexual battery in Indiana (2004 conviction);

and (3) sexual abuse in the first degree in Kentucky (2007 conviction). (Indictment at 1.) The

indictment alleged that Petitioner was subject to the penalty provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 924(e). (Id.)

       In December 2013, following a hearing conducted pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 11, the

Court accepted Petitioner’s guilty plea. (Hearing Tr., ECF No. 54 at 17.) At sentencing, the Court

concluded that Petitioner was not subject to the fifteen-year minimum sentence under section

924(e), because the residential entry conviction did not qualify as a predicate violent felony.

(Sentencing Tr., ECF No. 55 at 15-16.)

       The Court determined the sentencing guidelines range as follows: The base offense level

was 24, from which the Court subtracted three points for Petitioner’s acceptance of responsibility,

for a total offense level of 21. (Id. at 20, 23.) The Court found that Petitioner had a criminal

history category of five (category V), and thus determined the guidelines range to be from 70 to

87 months. (Id. at 23.)

       The Court departed upward from the guidelines range, and imposed a sentence of 120

months, relying on a number of the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553, most

particularly the need to protect the public. (Sentencing Tr., ECF No. 56 at 9-15.) Among other

things, the Court considered testimony of the woman who informed law enforcement that

Petitioner had a gun; the Court also considered Petitioner’s criminal history, including the

convictions for residential entry, sexual battery, and sexual abuse in the first degree. (Id. at 11-

14).

       The Court imposed a prison term of 120 months, followed by supervised release of three

years. (Id. at 15-16; Judgment at 2-3.) In addition, the Court imposed, as a special condition of




                                                 3
    Case 2:13-cr-00196-NT Document 80 Filed 11/10/16 Page 4 of 24                                  PageID #: 589



supervised release, the requirement that Petitioner participate in sex offender treatment.

(Sentencing Tr., ECF No. 56 at 19; Judgment at 4.)

         At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, the Court informed Petitioner that he had the

right to appeal: “I want to inform you that you have the right to appeal. To effectively exercise

your right of appeal, you have to be caused to be filed with the clerk of this court within 14 days

of today and not after that a written notice of appeal.” (Sentencing Tr., ECF No. 56 at 21.)

         Petitioner asserts that he placed his section 2255 motion in the prison mailing system on

May 13, 2015. (Motion at 35.) The motion was filed timely on May 18, 2015.1 (Id. at 1.)

                                               II.      DISCUSSION

         A. Legal Standards

         A person may move to vacate his or her sentence on one of four different grounds: (1) “that

the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States;” (2) “that

the court was without jurisdiction” to impose its sentence; (3) “that the sentence was in excess of

the maximum authorized by law;” or (4) that the sentence “is otherwise subject to collateral

attack.” 28 U.S.C. § 2255(a); see Knight v. United States, 37 F.3d 769, 772 (1st Cir. 1994).

         A section 2255 petitioner must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she

is entitled to section 2255 relief. David v. United States, 134 F.3d 470, 474 (1st Cir. 1998); United

States v. DiCarlo, 575 F.2d 952, 954 (1st Cir. 1978). When “a petition for federal habeas relief is

presented to the judge who presided at the petitioner’s trial, the judge is at liberty to employ the

knowledge gleaned during previous proceedings and make findings based thereon without

convening an additional hearing.” United States v. McGill, 11 F.3d 223, 225 (1st Cir. 1993).


1
  See 28 U.S.C. 2255(f) (providing in pertinent part that “[a] 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a motion under
this section. The limitation period shall run from the latest of – (1) the date on which the judgment of conviction
becomes final.”) The Government does not contest that the petition was filed timely. (Response, ECF No. 71 at 2
n.2.)

       A collateral challenge is not a substitute for an appeal. United States v. Frady, 456 U.S.

152, 165 (1982); Berthoff v. United States, 308 F.3d 124, 127 (1st Cir. 2002). “Accordingly, a

defendant’s failure to raise a claim in a timely manner at trial or on appeal constitutes a procedural

default that bars collateral review, unless the defendant can demonstrate cause for the failure and

prejudice or actual innocence.” Berthoff, 308 F.3d at 127-28. Procedural default is an affirmative

defense. Sotirion v. United States, 617 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir. 2010). The First Circuit has

recognized that “federal courts have the authority to consider procedural default sua sponte.”

Rosenthal v. O'Brien, 713 F.3d 676, 683 (1st Cir. 2013) (citing Brewer v. Marshall, 119 F.3d 993,

999 (1st Cir. 1997)); see also Daniels v. United States, 532 U.S. 374, 382-83 (2001) (recognizing

that “procedural default rules developed in the habeas corpus context apply in § 2255 cases”)

(citing Frady, 456 U.S. at 167-68).

       An allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel can excuse a procedural default, but only

if the petitioner demonstrates both that counsel’s representation fell below an objective standard

of reasonableness and that counsel’s deficient performance prejudiced the petitioner’s defense.

Turner v. United States, 699 F.3d 578, 584 (1st Cir. 2012) (citing Strickland v. Washington, 466

U.S. 668, 688 (1984)); Owens v. United States, 483 F.3d 48, 63 (1st Cir. 2007). A district court

reviewing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel need not address both prongs of the test

because a failure to meet either prong will undermine the claim. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697. If a

petitioner’s “claims fail on the merits, his related claims that counsel rendered ineffective

assistance in failing to press the claims at trial or on appeal must also fail.” Tse v. United States,

290 F.3d 462, 465 (1st Cir. 2002) (per curiam).

       In a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to file a notice of appeal, however,

a petitioner need not allege prejudice. See Rodriguez v. United States, 395 U.S. 327, 330 (1969)

(holding that “the courts below erred in rejecting petitioner’s application for [section 2255] relief

because of his failure to specify the points he would raise were his right to appeal reinstated”);

Bonneau v. United States, 961 F.2d 17, 23 (1st Cir. 1992) (same).

        “Evidentiary hearings on § 2255 petitions are the exception, not the norm, and there is a

heavy burden on the petitioner to demonstrate that an evidentiary hearing is warranted. An

evidentiary hearing ‘is not necessary when a [§] 2255 petition (1) is inadequate on its face, or

(2) although facially adequate, is conclusively refuted as to the alleged facts by the files and records

of the case.’” Moreno-Morales v. United States, 334 F.3d 140, 145 (1st Cir. 2003) (citation

omitted) (quoting DiCarlo, 575 F.2d at 954 (quotation marks omitted)). In determining whether

an evidentiary hearing is required, the court must “take as true the sworn allegations of fact set

forth in the petition ‘unless those allegations are merely conclusory, contradicted by the record, or

inherently incredible.’” Owens, 483 F.3d at 57 (quoting Ellis v. United States, 313 F.3d 636, 641

(1st Cir. 2002)). Summary dismissal of a motion is permitted when the allegations are “‘vague,

conclusory, or palpably incredible,’” even “‘if the record does not conclusively and expressly belie

[the] claim.’” David, 134 F.3d at 478 (quoting Machibroda v. United States, 368 U.S. 487, 495

(1962)). The Court can reasonably require a petitioner to supply the Court with salient details of

the claim prior to permitting discovery or a hearing. Id. (holding that “the district court did not

abuse its discretion in refusing to license a fishing expedition”).

        B. Claims and Analysis

            1. Failure to move to suppress (Ground Four)

         Petitioner alleges that counsel was ineffective for the failure to move to suppress evidence

from a warrantless search that Petitioner contends was unconstitutional. (Motion at 8.) Petitioner

maintains the search, which was conducted pursuant to the probation conditions imposed as part



                                                   6
    Case 2:13-cr-00196-NT Document 80 Filed 11/10/16 Page 7 of 24                                PageID #: 592



of his Kentucky sentence, was illegal because the five-year period of probation exceeded the

three-year maximum probation term permitted under Kentucky law, and the search occurred more

than three years into his probation.2 (Motion at 28-32.) Petitioner alleges that he told the probation

officer before the search that the maximum allowable three-year probation period had expired. (Id.

at 30.)

          Petitioner does not allege that he had successfully challenged the Kentucky judgment prior

to the search; rather, he alleges that in May 2015, i.e., more than 19 months after the search, he

filed a state court post-conviction petition to challenge the length of probation in his Kentucky

sentence, and he asserts the state court post-conviction proceeding was pending at the time he filed

his section 2255 motion. (Id. at 32; Kentucky petition, ECF No. 57-8.) In other words, Petitioner

does not dispute (1) that the Kentucky judgment and sentence were in place at the time of the

search, and (2) that the search occurred within the five-year probation period imposed as part of

the Kentucky sentence.

          Petitioner’s claim is foreclosed by the Supreme Court’s decision in Lewis v. United States,

445 U.S. 55, 67 (1980). In Lewis, the appellant challenged his conviction, under a statute that

preceded section 922(g)(1), based on his contention that the predicate state court conviction was

obtained when the appellant was without counsel.3 Lewis, 445 U.S. at 57-58. For purposes of its


2
  Petitioner alleges that he was released from incarceration in Kentucky on November 5, 2009, and that he arranged
to have his Kentucky probation supervised in Maine. (Motion, ECF No. 57 at 19; Kentucky state court petition, ECF
No. 57-8 at 2-3, 12-13.) The prosecution version, which Petitioner told the Court in the plea colloquy was true to his
personal knowledge, provides that the search that led to the federal felon-in-possession charge took place on
September 18, 2013, and that it was conducted pursuant to Petitioner’s probation conditions, including one that
“required him to submit to a search of his home upon reasonable suspicion of his possession of contraband.”
(Prosecution Version, ECF No. 24 at 1; Plea Tr., ECF No. 54 at 13-14.) Petitioner does not dispute either (1) that his
probation conditions prohibited firearms possession and required him to submit to warrantless searches, or (2) that a
probationer has a diminished reasonable expectation of privacy during the probationary period, see United States v.
Knights, 534 U.S. 112, 119-20 & n.6 (2001). (Motion, ECF No. 57 at 29; Reply, ECF No. 79 at 30.)
3
 The predecessor statute at issue in Lewis v. United States, 445 U.S. 55, 56 (1980), was 18 U.S.C.§ 1202(a)(1). See
United States v. Snyder, 235 F.3d 42, 52 (1st Cir. 2000) (describing 18 U.S.C. § 1202(a)(1) as a predecessor to 18
U.S.C. § 922(g)(1)).

Case 2:13-cr-00196-NT Document 80 Filed 11/10/16 Page 8 of 24                       PageID #: 593



analysis, the Supreme Court assumed the appellant could prove he was without counsel in the prior

state court prosecution. Id. at 58. “[I]t is important to note that a convicted felon may challenge

the validity of a prior conviction, or otherwise remove his disability, before obtaining a firearm.

We simply hold today that the firearms prosecution does not open the predicate conviction to a

new form of collateral attack.” Id. at 67-68 (citing Walker v. City of Birmingham, 388 U.S. 307

(1967)). In Lewis, the Court recognized that there was “little significant difference” between the

statute at issue in that case and section 922(g)(1). Id. at 64.

       In United States v. Snyder, 235 F.3d 42 (1st Cir. 2000), the First Circuit held, based on

Lewis, that a successful collateral attack on a predicate conviction for a section 922(g)(1) offense

did not warrant a new trial on the section 922(g)(1) offense. 235 F.3d at 51-53 (citing Lewis, 445

U.S. at 60-61, 64, 65); see also United States v. Roberson, 752 F.3d 517, 524 (1st Cir. 2014) (noting

that in Snyder, the Court “held that the later vacating of a state court conviction did not invalidate

the defendant’s federal conviction as a felon in possession of a firearm under [section 922(g)(1)]

because he was a felon at the time of the charged possession”).

       Petitioner’s challenge to the search is premised on his contention that in a prosecution

under section 922(g)(1), he can collaterally challenge the state court conviction. Lewis does not

permit such a defense; rather, the Court held that a challenge must have been filed and concluded

successfully, or the disability otherwise must have been removed, before a defendant obtains

possession of firearms. Lewis, 445 U.S. at 64, 67-68. Because Petitioner would have been

precluded from challenging the Kentucky judgment in his section 922(g)(1) prosecution, the Court

need not address Petitioner’s underlying argument that his Kentucky probation was invalid at the

time of the search. See id.; Snyder, 235 F.3d at 52-53. Given that Petitioner is not entitled to

challenge his felon-in-possession prosecution on the grounds that the predicate judgment was



                                                   8

flawed, Petitioner’s related claim of ineffective assistance for failure to file a motion to suppress

also fails. See Tse, 290 F.3d at 465.4

             2. Failure to appeal (Ground One)

         Petitioner alleges that he asked counsel to file an appeal, and that counsel was ineffective

when he failed to file a notice of appeal and failed to pursue an appeal. (Motion at 4, 15.) Petitioner

contends that there are material issues of fact in dispute regarding his communication with his

attorney, and he requests an evidentiary hearing to resolve the disputes. (Reply at 3.) Petitioner

argues that an appeal was important due to the above-guidelines sentence. (Id. at 4.)

         On May 6, 2014, at the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, the Court informed Petitioner

that he had the right to appeal:

         I want to inform you that you have the right to appeal. To effectively exercise your
         right of appeal, you have to be caused to be filed with the clerk of this court within
         14 days of today and not after that a written notice of appeal. Do you understand,
         sir?

(Sentencing Tr., ECF No. 56 at 1, 21.) Petitioner replied, “Yes, Your Honor.” (Id.) The Court

then told Petitioner: “And I advise you that if you fail to timely file a written notice of appeal

you’ll have given up your right to appeal the sentence and conviction. Do you understand that?”

(Id.) Petitioner again replied, “Yes, Your Honor.” (Id.)




4
  In his reply, Petitioner also responds to the Government’s argument that the search was valid, independent of
Petitioner’s probation conditions, because probable cause existed and Petitioner consented. (Response, ECF No. 71
at 38; Reply, ECF No. 79 at 31-32.) Petitioner argues that probable cause did not exist because Petitioner’s friend
who contacted the probation officer provided information that was uncorroborated, and the friend proved unreliable
because she was not available at sentencing. (Reply at 31-32.) The Court need not address this argument because,
for the reasons explained above, the warrantless search was valid under Petitioner’s probation conditions.
Nonetheless, Petitioner’s argument that the friend’s failure to appear at sentencing indicates that she was unreliable
lacks merit because there is nothing indicating that the information obtained at sentencing about the friend’s
availability at that time was also available to law enforcement at the time of the search.

Case 2:13-cr-00196-NT Document 80 Filed 11/10/16 Page 10 of 24                        PageID #: 595



        According to Petitioner, following the entry of the Court’s judgment on May 6, 2014

(Motion at 13-14; Judgment at 1), his counsel sent him a letter dated May 7, 2014 (Letter, ECF

No. 57-2), which stated in relevant part:

        I have explained to [you] that you have a legal right to appeal the sentence. I agree
        with your decision not to appeal. The issue for an appeal is not if we find the
        sentence “fair”, but rather if it meets the allowable legal standard. A sentence will
        be []found substantively reasonable if the court has provided a plausible
        explanation, and the overall result is defensible. United States v. Innarelli, 524 F.3d
        286, 292 (1st Cir. 2008). The First Circuit court of appeals recently upheld a 10
        year sentence for a felon in conviction [sic] of a firearm with very similar facts to
        your case. U.S. v. Dwayne Taylor, No. 12-1469, Nov. 4, 2013. (Advisory
        Guideline range of 51-63 months and a sentence of 10 years upheld on appeal as
        reasonable). Most importantly, I do not expect the government to appeal the ACCA
        denial ruling in light of the 10 year sentence. If you were to appeal the sentence,
        the government could cross appeal the denial of ACCA and you could potentially
        face a much higher sentence triggered by your own appeal! I cannot know if the
        government would in fact cross appeal but this is a real risk. For these reasons, I
        agree with your decision not to appeal the sentence, and also recognize the final
        choice of an appeal is yours to make.

        ...

        I will send to your father a copy of this letter, the judgment, docket sheet and your
        military medical records so he will have all of that information if you ever need it.
        My role in the case is now coming to an end and I will be closing our file. Should
        you have any future questions you certainly may write or have your father contact
        me.

(Id. at 2-3.)

        Petitioner asserts he sent counsel a letter dated May 12, 2014, which letter he attached to

his motion, advising counsel that he wanted to appeal. (Motion at 14; Letter, ECF No. 57-3.)

Petitioner also alleges that on May 12, 2014, along with the letter, he returned a form to counsel

that was similar to the form notice of appeal that counsel later provided to Petitioner on a disc that

contained Petitioner’s electronic file. (Motion at 15; Form, ECF No. 57-6.) The form attached to

Petitioner’s motion is stamped “FILE COPY;” it is unsigned by Petitioner; it references a date of

April 10, 2014, which is not the judgment date of May 6, 2014; and it states in part: “IF you decide


                                                  10

to appeal, this Notice of Appeal Form must be filed with the Clerk, U.S. District Court, 156 Federal

St., Portland, ME 04101 within 14 days of the day you are sentenced.” (Form, ECF No. 57-6.)

        Petitioner also alleges he sent counsel a letter dated January 13, 2015, which letter he

attached to the section 2255 motion, reminding counsel that when Petitioner saw him after

sentencing, he told counsel that he wanted to appeal. (Motion at 14; Letter, ECF No. 57-4.) The

letter states:

        I have not heard anything from you in a while. The last time I saw you was after
        my sentencing. . . . At that time I told you I wanted to appeal the sentence. You
        left me with a “form” regarding appeal, which I signed and returned to you.

(Motion at 14; Letter, ECF No. 57-4.) Petitioner apparently contends that at sentencing, counsel

left him with a form notice of appeal, which form Petitioner alleges that he subsequently signed

and returned to counsel on May 12. (Motion at 15.) Petitioner asserts that in his January 13, 2015,

letter to counsel, he also asked counsel to send him a complete copy of the case file, and in response

counsel provided the disc. (Motion at 15; Letters, ECF No. 57-4, 57-5 at 2.) Petitioner evidently

maintains that the form notice of appeal attached to his section 2255 motion is the form he received

on the disc as part of the file counsel sent him. (Motion at 15.)

        By letter dated January 22, 2015, counsel expressed his surprise with Petitioner’s letter;

counsel told Petitioner that “there is no appeal,” and that “[y]ou told me you did not want to appeal

in light of the judge’s ruling that ACCA did not apply.” (Motion at 14; Letter, ECF No. 57-5 at

1.) Counsel also wrote:

        Following my letter to you of May 7, 2014[,] I never heard any other thing from
        you until your letter to me that arrived yesterday. However, I did follow up with
        your father, again as you requested, and sent him your medical records which we
        obtained from the VA. No one ever contacted me and asked about an appeal. You
        not only did not seek [an] appeal, I confirmed in writing what you told me that you
        did not want to appeal. You never returned any signed [form] to me. In fact, the
        form I gave you was so that IF you decided you did want to appeal you could sign
        the form and mail it to the court. The form has the court’s address on it and says it


                                                 11
Case 2:13-cr-00196-NT Document 80 Filed 11/10/16 Page 12 of 24                                      PageID #: 597



         must be signed and mailed to the court within 14 days of sentencing. At sentencing
         the judge told you the same thing.

(Letter, ECF No. 57-5 at 1.)

         When determining whether an evidentiary hearing is needed on Petitioner’s section 2255

motion, Petitioner’s allegations are accepted as true, except to the extent the record demonstrates

otherwise.5 See DeCologero v. United States, 802 F.3d 155, 167 (1st Cir. 2015); Owens, 483 F.3d

at 57. The Supreme Court has recognized that “a lawyer who disregards specific instructions from

the defendant to file a notice of appeal acts in a manner that is professionally unreasonable.” Roe

v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470, 477 (2000). A petitioner need not allege prejudice, i.e., he need

not allege meritorious points he would raise if his right to an appeal were reinstated. Rodriguez,

395 U.S. at 330; Bonneau, 961 F.2d at 23.

         The current record generates several questions regarding Petitioner’s alleged

communications with his counsel about the notice of appeal. In fact, in Petitioner’s section 2255

motion, he alleges two potentially conflicting versions of the events in the immediate aftermath of

the sentencing. Through reliance on the May 12, 2014, letter he purportedly sent to his counsel,

Petitioner apparently contends he informed his counsel of his decision to appeal in writing after

considering the issue for several days. (Motion at 14-15; Letter, ECF No. 57-3.) Based on his

January 13, 2015, letter to his counsel, to which letter counsel responded and thus received,




5
  The Government argues preliminarily that the claim should be dismissed because Petitioner did not make his
allegations under oath or the statutory alternative to the oath. (Response at 25.) The standard form that Petitioner
used states: “For this motion, state every ground on which you claim that you are being held in violation of the
Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. Attach additional pages if you have more than four grounds.”
(Motion at 3.) Because the form itself states that additional pages may be added, it is logical to conclude that the
additional pages should be considered to have been incorporated in the petition by reference and signed under penalty
of perjury. Separate filings may be another matter, but in this case, it appears that the government's objections are to
an attachment that is actually part of the petition itself. Furthermore, the memorandum contained a statement and
signature that appear to meet the requirements of Rule 2 of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings. (Motion
at 13.) The allegations contained in the memorandum attached to Petitioner’s section 2255 motion thus are adequately
sworn. See 28 U.S.C. § 1746; Rule 2 of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings.

                                                          12
Case 2:13-cr-00196-NT Document 80 Filed 11/10/16 Page 13 of 24                      PageID #: 598



Petitioner evidently alleges (1) he made the decision to appeal when he consulted with counsel in

person, sometime after the conclusion of the sentencing hearing; (2) in response, counsel left him

with a form notice of appeal; and (3) Petitioner later sent the form notice of appeal to counsel with

instructions to file it. (Motion at 14-15; Letter, ECF No. 57-4.)

       Significantly, Petitioner’s assertion in his January 2015 letter that when he last “saw” his

counsel he told his counsel that he wanted to appeal can legitimately be questioned, due in part to

the delay between the sentencing in May 2014 and the January 2015 letter. See McQuiggin v.

Perkins, 133 S. Ct. 1924, 1928 (2013) (“Our opinion clarifies that a federal habeas court, faced

with an actual-innocence gateway claim, should count unjustifiable delay on a habeas petitioner’s

part, not as an absolute barrier to relief, but as a factor in determining whether actual innocence

has been reliably shown.”); Blackledge v. Allison, 431 U.S. 63, 78 n. 15 (1977) (citations omitted)

(noting that this was not a case in which “delay by the prisoner in seeking postconviction relief

undercuts the credibility of his allegations”); Broadnax v. United States, No. 3:09cv720, 2013 WL

4482778, at *6-8, 2013 U.S. Dist. Lexis 118852, at *16-17 (D. Conn. Aug. 21, 2013) (holding that

the petitioner’s lack of corroborated contemporaneous documentation of his alleged instruction to

counsel to file a notice of appeal, combined with the delay between the alleged instruction to

counsel and the filing of the habeas petition, undermined the petitioner’s credibility and

contributed to the determination that the petitioner failed to meet his burden to prove that he

instructed counsel to file a notice of appeal).

       In addition, the May 12, 2014, letter is suspect because Petitioner has not provided any

independent corroboration that he sent the letter to counsel. See United States v. Butt, 731 F.2d

75, 80 n.5 (1st Cir. 1984) (“Evidentiary hearings have been granted to § 2255 appellants who have

claimed that their plea was induced by attorney misrepresentations only when the allegations were



                                                  13
Case 2:13-cr-00196-NT Document 80 Filed 11/10/16 Page 14 of 24                           PageID #: 599



highly specific and usually accompanied by some independent corroboration.”). Indeed, the letter

lacks counsel’s address.

           Given the record, the lack of corroboration in this case is particularly concerning. In his

January 13, 2015, letter, Petitioner makes no mention of the May 12 letter he maintains he

forwarded to Petitioner’s counsel. Logic suggests if the letter was genuine and sent to counsel,

Petitioner would have provided his counsel with a copy of the letter in January 2015, just as

Petitioner filed a copy of the letter with the Court. At a minimum, Petitioner would have

referenced the May 12 letter in his January letter.

           Petitioner nevertheless maintains a factual issue exists as to whether Petitioner asked his

counsel to file a notice of appeal. He thus contends an evidentiary hearing is necessary. Even if a

factual issue exists, resolution of the factual dispute does not necessarily require a testimonial

hearing. Section 2255(c) states: “A court may entertain and determine such motion without

requiring the production of the prisoner at the hearing.” In situations in which a hearing of some

sort may be necessary, the district court has discretion to determine whether or not to conduct a

full testimonial hearing:

           What has been said is not to imply that a movant must always be allowed to appear
           in a district court for a full hearing if the record does not conclusively and expressly
           belie his claim, no matter how vague, conclusory, or palpably incredible his
           allegations may be. The language of the statute does not strip the district courts of
           all discretion to exercise their common sense. Indeed, the statute itself recognizes
           that there are times when allegations of facts outside the record can be fully
           investigated without requiring the personal presence of the prisoner.

Machibroda, 368 U.S. at 495 & n.4 (citing 28 U.S.C. § 2255(c)). Furthermore, Rule 7 of the Rules

Governing Section 2255 Proceedings provides that the Court may direct the parties to expand the

record.6


6
    Rule 7 of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings states:


                                                         14
Case 2:13-cr-00196-NT Document 80 Filed 11/10/16 Page 15 of 24                                     PageID #: 600



          In this case, while the Court could arguably grant the Government’s motion to dismiss on

the current record, to ensure that Petitioner has had the opportunity to address the issues of concern

set forth herein, before the Court decides whether to grant the Government’s motion, the better

course would be to permit Petitioner to submit evidence, in a form that establishes its admissibility,

that Petitioner believes corroborates his communications with his counsel regarding the notice of

appeal.

              3. Failure to investigate and challenge the Kentucky conviction at sentencing
                 (Ground Two)

          Petitioner alleges that counsel was ineffective for the failure to investigate and challenge

the predicate Kentucky conviction at sentencing. (Motion at 5, 18.) Petitioner alleges he told

counsel that he thought the Kentucky judgment was unconstitutional.7 (Id. at 21.) As with

Petitioner’s claim regarding counsel’s failure to file a motion to suppress, Petitioner’s sentencing

claim is based on the argument that the Kentucky conviction is flawed because the probation period

provided in the Kentucky sentence was longer than permitted under Kentucky law. (Motion at 18-

21; Reply at 14-26.) Petitioner argues that at sentencing, counsel failed to challenge the Court’s

reliance on the Kentucky conviction to raise the base offense level to 24, pursuant to U.S.S.G. §

2K2.1(a)(2); to increase the criminal history score and criminal history category, pursuant to

U.S.S.G. §§ 4A1.1(d), 5A; and to depart upward from the guidelines range, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.


          (a)      In General. If the motion is not dismissed, the judge may direct the parties to expand the
          record by submitting additional materials relating to the motion. The judge may require that these
          materials be authenticated.

          (b)      Types of Materials. The materials that may be required include letters predating the filing
          of the motion, documents, exhibits, and answers under oath to written interrogatories propounded
          by the judge. Affidavits also may be submitted and considered as part of the record.

          (c)      Review by the Opposing Party. The judge must give the party against whom the
          additional materials are offered an opportunity to admit or deny their correctness.
7
 At sentencing, counsel told the Court that Petitioner had factual objections to prior convictions, including the
Kentucky conviction. (Sentencing Tr., ECF No. 52 at 10.)

                                                          15
Case 2:13-cr-00196-NT Document 80 Filed 11/10/16 Page 16 of 24                                       PageID #: 601



§ 3553(a). (Sentencing Tr., ECF No. 55 at 23; Sentencing Tr., ECF No. 56 at 12-15; Reply at 14-

26.)

         The analysis of the Kentucky conviction is different for sentencing than when determining

whether Petitioner committed an offense under section 922(g)(1). See Snyder, 235 F.3d at 52-53.

In Snyder, the appellant had prevailed in a collateral challenge to a predicate state court stalking

conviction, and he sought to vacate his section 922(g)(1) conviction on that basis. Id. at 51 & n.10.

The First Circuit held that the district court did not err in denying a new trial on the section

922(g)(1) offense, but it recognized that “Lewis is inapplicable where prior convictions are used

to determine the punishment, rather than to define the offense.” Id. at 53 (quoting United States

v. Paleo, 9 F.3d 988, 989 (1st Cir. 1992)) (quotation marks omitted).

         The sentencing guidelines commentary provides that in limited situations, prior

convictions are not to be counted in calculating a defendant’s criminal history:

         Sentences resulting from convictions that (A) have been reversed or vacated
         because of errors of law or because of subsequently discovered evidence
         exonerating the defendant, or (B) have been ruled constitutionally invalid in a prior
         case are not to be counted. With respect to the current sentencing proceeding, this
         guideline and commentary do not confer upon the defendant any right to attack
         collaterally a prior conviction or sentence beyond any such rights otherwise
         recognized in law (e.g., 21 U.S.C. § 851 expressly provides that a defendant may
         collaterally attack certain prior convictions).

         Nonetheless, the criminal conduct underlying any conviction that is not counted in
         the criminal history score may be considered pursuant to §4A1.3 (Adequacy of
         Criminal History Category).

U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2 cmt. n.6; Paleo, 9 F.3d at 989.8



8
  In United States v. Paleo, 9 F.3d 988, 988 (1st Cir. 1992), the First Circuit held that 18 U.S.C. § 924(e) does not
require a sentencing court “to enhance a sentence in light of an earlier conviction that the sentencing court has
determined was imposed in violation of the Constitution.” The First Circuit recognized that although Application
Note 6 to U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2 is broadly analogous to 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), the guidelines provision “arises in a different
legal context and uses language critically different from the statute here in question.” Id. at 989. In Petitioner’s case,
the Court determined that one of the requisite three prior violent felonies did not qualify as a predicate, and therefore
section 924(e) does not apply. (Sentencing Tr., ECF No. 55 at 15-16.) Paleo is distinguishable on that basis.

                                                           16
Case 2:13-cr-00196-NT Document 80 Filed 11/10/16 Page 17 of 24                                     PageID #: 602



         Because the state court sentence had not been reversed or vacated due to an error of law,

nor had it been ruled constitutionally invalid in a prior case, the Court properly included

Petitioner’s Kentucky conviction in the calculation of his criminal history. See U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2

cmt. n.6. The Court also appropriately considered the Kentucky conviction in its application of

the sentencing factors under section 3553(a). See United States v. Perez-Perez, 626 F. App’x 8,

10 (1st Cir. 2015) (per curiam) (noting that “[t]he district court expressly considered the § 3553(a)

factors, noting in particular [the defendant’s] prior conviction”). The claim therefore fails, as does

Petitioner’s related claim of ineffective assistance for failure to challenge the Kentucky conviction

at sentencing. See Tse, 290 F.3d at 465.

             4. Failure to investigate bases for mitigation (Ground Three)

         Petitioner alleges that counsel was ineffective for the failure to pursue adequately two bases

for mitigation at sentencing. (Motion at 6.)

         First, Petitioner alleges that the woman who was the victim in both the Indiana sexual

battery and the Kentucky sexual abuse in the first degree matters recanted the allegations that led

to the Indiana conviction, and that Petitioner and the victim married, although they later divorced.

(Id. at 22-24: Reply at 27-28.) Petitioner also alleges that the victim originally recanted the

allegations that resulted in the Kentucky conviction. (Motion at 23-24.) Petitioner asserts that the

victim failed to follow through with the recantation, and he requests the opportunity to obtain

recantation evidence from counsel in the Kentucky conviction.9 (Id. at 24.)

         Second, Petitioner argues that the friend who reported his possession of firearms was not a

credible grand jury witness. (Motion at 25-28; Reply at 29-30.) The friend testified that Petitioner

put a firearm in her hands against her will; Petitioner contends that counsel should have argued


9
 Petitioner alleges that the victim made the recantation statement in the Kentucky case to counsel, after which counsel
withdrew to serve as a witness. (Motion at 23-24.)

                                                          17
Case 2:13-cr-00196-NT Document 80 Filed 11/10/16 Page 18 of 24                         PageID #: 603



that the witness’s lack of availability at sentencing suggested that her grand jury testimony was

not credible, and that the grand jury transcript should not have been admitted. (Motion at 25-28;

Reply at 29-30.)

           Both of Petitioner’s arguments relate to the Court’s analysis of the section 3553(a)

sentencing factors, particularly section 3553(a)(1), which requires the Court to take into account

“the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.”

(Sentencing Tr., ECF No. 55 at 35-36.) The relevant portion of the presentence investigation report

states:

           On September 18, 2013, Carter’s supervising officer received a phone call from a
           woman explaining that she had been in a relationship with Carter for three weeks
           and was concerned that his mental health was declining. Specifically, the woman
           advised that Carter made disturbing remarks about the recent Naval Shipyard
           shooting in Washington D.C. and insinuated that the suspect’s actions were
           justified. The woman further reported that Carter was in possession of at least two
           firearms and that he placed a gun in her hands (on one prior occasion) even though
           she told him she did not want to handle it. The complainant informed that Carter
           kept a revolver beside his bed on a nightstand and that a second firearm was hidden
           in a cloth bag in the back bedroom of his residence. As conditions of his probation,
           Carter was prohibited from possessing firearms and was subject to random searches
           of his home based upon reasonable suspicion of a violation of his probation
           conditions.

At sentencing, counsel explained that Petitioner did not challenge the fact that the woman made

the report. (Id. at 37.) The Court noted, however, that Petitioner contested that he had acted in the

manner reported. (Id. at 39-40.)

           The Court granted a continuance to give the Government the opportunity to prove that

Petitioner acted in accordance with the woman’s report. (Id. at 40.) The Court informed the

parties:

           I consider putting a firearm in the hands of someone who doesn’t want to hold one
           dangerous behavior, and I consider that particularly in light of the defendant’s past
           criminal history, which involved a lot of violence against women and controlling
           of women that I find troubling.


                                                    18
Case 2:13-cr-00196-NT Document 80 Filed 11/10/16 Page 19 of 24                      PageID #: 604




(Sentencing Tr., ECF No. 55 at 36.) The Court noted that the conduct, if proven, would be an

important factor at sentencing, in that it might mean the difference between a sentence within the

guidelines range and one that departed upward from the guidelines range. (Id. at 40-41.)

         Following the continuance, the Government represented that it was not able to locate the

witness. (Sentencing Tr., ECF No. 56 at 5.) In lieu of the witness’s live testimony, the Government

offered a transcript of the witness’s grand jury testimony. (Id. at 3.) Counsel acknowledged that

the grand jury testimony was admissible, but he argued that its probative value was diminished

based on the testimony and the witness’s unavailability at sentencing. (Id. at 7-9.) See United

States v. Dyer, 589 F.3d 520, 531-32 (1st Cir. 2009) (noting that “the Confrontation Clause does

not apply at sentencing”).

       The Court recognized that the grand jury testimony was hearsay not subject to

cross-examination, but the Court found that the testimony was truthful. (Id. at 11.) The finding

was based on (1) the consistency between the reported behavior and Petitioner’s prior criminal

behavior, particularly that the behavior was sexually aggressive, that it involved control issues,

and that the witness did not consent to her most recent sexual encounter with Petitioner; and (2)

that the witness’s testimony about the location of the firearms was corroborated by the search.

(Id. at 11-13.) The Court also found that both the Indiana sexual battery conviction and the

Kentucky conviction for sexual assault in the first degree were corroborated by physical evidence.

(Id. at 13-14.) Finally, the Court determined that Petitioner had engaged in aggressive conduct in

the residential entry crime, and that he intended to restrain and rape the victim. (Id. at 13.) The

Court thus explicitly considered the unavailability of the witness, but decided nonetheless to credit

the grand jury testimony. (Id. at 11.)




                                                 19
Case 2:13-cr-00196-NT Document 80 Filed 11/10/16 Page 20 of 24                       PageID #: 605



       Petitioner’s argument that counsel was ineffective for failing to seek the exclusion of the

grand jury testimony is meritless, see Dyer, 589 F.3d at 531-32, and counsel argued that the grand

jury testimony should be given less weight because the witness was unavailable at sentencing.

(Sentencing Tr., ECF No. 56 at 7-9.) Furthermore, the Court considered the evidence Petitioner

offered in mitigation, including letters of support, Petitioner’s military service, his employment,

his mother’s statements about his childhood nature, and his health issues. (Id. at 14-15.) The

Court ultimately determined the protection of the public to be the overriding factor, based on the

danger Petitioner posed to the community generally, and specifically to women with whom he has

relationships. (Id. at 15.) Under the circumstances, counsel’s performance was not deficient, nor

was Petitioner prejudiced.

       In support of his section 2255 argument that the victim recanted during the Indiana

prosecution, Petitioner submitted an affidavit of the attorney who represented him in the Indiana

case. (Motion at 22-24; Affidavit, ECF No. 57-9.) The attorney’s affidavit alleges in pertinent

part: “[The victim] completely recanted her accusations of criminal sexual behavior to the extent

that a possible obstruction of justice or perjury charge could have been leveled against her. . . . In

my opinion, [Petitioner] agreed to plead guilty to a Sexual Battery charge to shield his new wife

from potential criminal charges for falsely accusing him.” (Affidavit at 1.) In the plea transcript

attached to the attorney affidavit, the attorney referred to recantation testimony the victim gave in

a deposition in the Indiana criminal prosecution against Petitioner. (Affidavit at 11.) In his section

2255 motion, Petitioner describes the circumstances of the Indiana crime as a “love spat” that

resulted in the victim’s desire to do harm to Petitioner. (Motion at 22.) Petitioner alleges that if

Petitioner’s counsel at his federal sentencing had presented the Indiana attorney affidavit, the Court

would have been aware that the victim recanted. (Id. at 23; Reply at 28.)

       It is unlikely that the recantation testimony would have altered Petitioner’s sentence.

Compare Sears v. Upton, 561 U.S. 945, 954-55 (2010) (per curiam) (noting that “there is no

prejudice when the new mitigating evidence ‘would barely have altered the sentencing profile

presented’ to the decisionmaker,” but holding that the state court undertook a “truncated prejudice

inquiry” under the circumstances presented) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 700). The transcript

attached to the attorney affidavit shows that Petitioner admitted in the Indiana plea hearing that he

compelled the victim to submit to touching “by threatening her with the use of force, roughing her

up, inflicting pain . . . .” (Affidavit at 10.) The Indiana court explicitly addressed the recantation

testimony, and in particular Petitioner’s right to argue that he should be permitted to use it to

impeach the victim and obtain a certain jury instruction, should Petitioner have chosen to go to

trial. (Id. at 11-12.) In addition, at Petitioner’s sentencing on the federal offense, the Court found

that the Indiana crime was corroborated by physical evidence. (Sentencing Tr., ECF No. 56 at 13.)

       If, at the federal sentencing, Petitioner had presented the plea transcript from his Indiana

case and argued that he was entitled to mitigation because the Indiana crime was merely a love

spat, given the other evidence presented at sentencing about Petitioner’s treatment of women, the

Court could easily have concluded that the transcript and Petitioner’s argument constituted even

more evidence that Petitioner engaged in a pattern of blaming his victims; at sentencing, the Court

observed that Petitioner had blamed his victims. (Id. at 14.) In short, Petitioner cannot establish

that counsel’s failure to present the recantation testimony as grounds for mitigation constituted

deficient performance, nor can he establish that there is a reasonable probability that he would

have received a more favorable sentence had the recantation testimony been presented. See Sears,

561 U.S. at 956.

                5. Failure to challenge the special condition of supervised release

           Petitioner alleges that counsel was ineffective for the failure to challenge adequately the

requirement, imposed as a special condition of supervised release, that Petitioner participate in sex

offender treatment.10 (Motion at 8.) Petitioner argues that the special condition is not warranted

because the felon-in-possession conviction was not a sexual crime, and he already completed a

similar program as part of his Kentucky sentence. (Id. at 33.)

           The Probation Office recommended that sex offender special conditions be included in the

sentence, including that Petitioner be required to undergo sex offender treatment, due to

Petitioner’s criminal history. (Sentencing Tr., ECF No. 56 at 18-19.) The Court accepted the

recommendation of the Probation Office. (Id. at 19.) One can reasonably infer that the Court was

persuaded by the rationale provided by the Probation Office, given that the Court noted that the

woman who reported the felon-in-possession crime testified that Petitioner had engaged in

sexually aggressive behavior, and given that the Court found that the behavior was similar to

Petitioner’s prior criminal history. (Id. at 11.) See McGill, 11 F.3d at 225.

           The First Circuit has held that special conditions may be imposed at the discretion of the

district court. United States v. Medina, 779 F.3d 55, 60 (1st Cir. 2015) (citing 18 U.S.C. §

3583(d)). The discretion is limited in that the special condition (1) must be reasonably related to

the sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a); (2) must involve no greater deprivation of liberty

10
     The following is the special condition:

           Defendant shall fully participate in sex offender treatment as directed by the Supervising Officer.
           Defendant shall pay/co-pay for services during such treatment, to the supervising officer’s
           satisfaction. He or she shall scrupulously abide by all policies and procedures of that program.
           During sex offender treatment, Defendant shall, if required by the therapeutic program, undergo
           periodic random polygraph examinations to ensure compliance with the therapeutic program
           requirements. No violation proceedings will arise solely on Defendant’s failure to pass a polygraph
           examination or on Defendant’s refusal to answer polygraph questions based on 5th Amendment
           grounds.

(Judgment, ECF No. 42 at 4.)

than is reasonably necessary under section 3553(a); and (3) must be consistent with any pertinent

policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 994(a). 18 U.S.C.

§ 3583(d); Medina, 779 F.3d at 60.

       In Petitioner’s case, the requirement that he participate in sex offender treatment was

reasonably related to the section 3553(a) sentencing factors, particularly Petitioner’s prior criminal

history and the factual circumstances reported in the felon-in-possession offense. Compare

Medina, 779 F.3d at 60, 63 (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1), (2)(B), (2)(C), & (2)(D) and concluding

that there was no evidence that linked the special condition at issue in that case to the risk of

recidivism). In Petitioner’s case, the Court explicitly found that Petitioner had used violence to

perpetrate the prior sexual crimes, and the Court found that the section 922(g)(1) crime also

involved sexually aggressive behavior. (Sentencing Tr., ECF No. 56 at 11.) In other words, the

Court found, in Petitioner’s case, a link between the special condition and the section 922(g)(1)

offense. The record, therefore, supports the imposition of a special condition of sex offender

treatment as part of Petitioner’s sentence for the section 922(g)(1) crime. See United States v.

Webster, 819 F.3d 35, 41 (1st Cir. 2016) (holding that “the district court sufficiently articulated

the need for sex offender treatment and polygraph testing” when it “provided a detailed accounting

as to why the imposed conditions were appropriate”).

       Because the special condition is reasonably related to the sentencing factors, the underlying

argument lacks merit, and consequently the related ineffective assistance claim also fails. Tse, 290

F.3d at 465.

                                       III.    CONCLUSION

       Based on the foregoing analysis, an evidentiary hearing is not warranted under Rule 8 of

the Rules Governing Section 2255 Cases. As to Petitioner’s claim regarding the notice of appeal,



                                                 23

I recommend, pursuant to Rule 7 of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings, the Court

allow Petitioner twenty days to submit admissible evidence that Petitioner believes corroborates

his communications with his counsel regarding the notice of appeal. I also recommend that if

Petitioner files any such evidence, the Court permit the Government to file a response to

Petitioner’s submission within 20 day of the filing. I further recommend that the Court deny

Petitioner’s motion for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 on all remaining claims. I further

recommend that the Court deny a certificate of appealability pursuant to Rule 11 of the Rules

Governing Section 2255 Cases on the claims the Court denies because there is no substantial

showing of the denial of a constitutional right within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).
