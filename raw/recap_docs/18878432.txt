                                            ORDER

        Having considered the Report and Recommendation filed on March 20, 2014 (docket
entry 310) on a Rule 11 proceeding of defendant [1] Oscar Sánchez-Martínez before
U.S. Magistrate Judge Silvia Carreño-Coll on March 19, 2014, to which no objection has
been filed, the same is APPROVED. Accordingly, the plea of guilty of defendant is
accepted. The Court FINDS that his plea was voluntary and intelligently entered with
awareness of his rights and the consequences of pleading guilty and contains all elements
of the offense charged in the indictment.
        This case was referred to the U.S. Probation Office for preparation of a Presentence
Investigation Report since March 19, 2014. The sentencing hearing is set for June 19,
2014 at 4:15 PM.
        The U.S. Probation Officer is reminded that, should any objections be raised by
defendant to the PreSentence Report, the Addendum to said PreSentence Report must
specifically identify any unresolved objections, the grounds for the objections, and the
U.S. Probation Officer’s comments on them, as required by Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(g). The
party that raised the unresolved objections shall, within twenty-four (24) hours after the
Addendum is disclosed, state in writing whether it will insist that the unresolved objections

be ruled upon by the Court. Failure to do so will be deemed by the Court as a withdrawal
of the unresolved objections.
      SO ORDERED.
      At San Juan, Puerto Rico, on April 9, 2014.
