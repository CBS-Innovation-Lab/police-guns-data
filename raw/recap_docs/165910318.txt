                  GOVERNMENT’S SENTENCING MEMORANDUM

     Now comes the United States, through undersigned counsel,

and respectfully requests that this Court impose a sentence of 24

months in this case, a sentence called for under the applicable

provisions of the United States Sentencing Guidelines

(“U.S.S.G.”), in addition to three years of supervised release

with special conditions.     As grounds therefore, the government

submits the following.

I.   BACKGROUND

     The government’s case against Eden Hok (hereinafter “Hok”)

demonstrates that Hok is a supplier of firearms to TRG - Grey.

TRG is a national street gang with roots in Long Beach and

Fresno, California.    In its most recent intelligence report and

threat assessment, the Boston Division of the FBI rated TRG as

one of the most significant national gangs operating in the area.

TRG - Grey is an offshoot of the original TRG.          According to

intelligence from the Lowell Police Department there are

                                    1
       Case 1:08-cr-10203-IT Document 34 Filed 04/28/09 Page 2 of 15



approximately 80 active members of TRG - Grey in Lowell and as

many as 60 inactive members.      Members of TRG - Grey have been

involved in numerous crimes throughout the City of Lowell,

including murders, robberies, assaults, shootings, and drug

dealing.   In short, the defendant was charged as a part of a

coordinated effort by state, local and federal law enforcement to

address the firearm and gang violence in Lowell after a review of

the crime data for the city led to the determination that TRG -

Grey was responsible for some of the most violent crime in the

City of Lowell.   See Affidavit of Special Agent Chad Blackwood,

Exhibit 1.

     The government’s contention that Hok is a supplier of

firearms to TRG - Grey is supported by the following

transactions, to which Hok has plead Guilty.         On September 25,

2007, Hok sold a 9mm, Smith & Wesson, model SW9VE, semi-automatic

pistol with serial number PBK7201 and two magazines to the

cooperating witness (“CW”) in exchange for $450.00 dollars.            On

October 25, 2007, Hok sold a .40 caliber, Smith & Wesson, model

SW40VE, semi-automatic pistol with serial number PBZ5740 and 3

magazines to the CW in exchange for $650.00 dollars.           On March

13, 2008, Hok sold a 9mm Luger caliber, S.W.D. Incorporated,

model M-11, semi-automatic pistol with serial number XX-XXXXXXX,

two muzzle attachments, 4 magazines, (2) 7.62 x 39mm cartridges,

and (8) 9mm Luger live cartridges to the CW in exchange for


                                    2
          Case 1:08-cr-10203-IT Document 34 Filed 04/28/09 Page 3 of 15



$900.00 dollars.1

     While Hok is not a TRG gang member and was not known to the

Lowell Police prior to this investigation, he has demonstrated

that he has the capacity to obtain weapons and is a supplier of

weapons to the gang.       According to the CW, Hok is aware that the

CW is a gang member and has asked the CW about the gang, other

gang members, and their activities.

     The government has reviewed the Presentence Report (“PSR”)

in this matter and agrees with the probation department that the

defendant’s base offense level, pursuant to U.S.S.G.

§2K2.1(a)(7), is 12.       PSR at ¶43.     The government further agrees

with the probation department that the base offense level is

increased two points pursuant to U.S.S.G. §2K2.1(b)(1)(a), as the

offense involved three or more firearms.           PSR at ¶44.

Additionally, the government agrees that the base offense level

is increased by four points pursuant to U.S.S.G. §2K2.1(b)(5), as

the defendant engaged in trafficking of firearms.             PSR at ¶45.

     The defendant’s criminal history category is I, as the

defendant has no convictions, thus he has zero criminal history

points.     PSR at ¶56.    The defendant’s corresponding guideline

sentencing range would therefore be 18-24 months.             PSR at ¶118.

     The government recommends that the Court impose a sentence

of 24 months incarceration, and a term of supervised release of

three years with certain conditions including a geographical

restriction aimed at preventing the defendant from returning to

the area of the family business on Westford Street - the location

of the instant offense and significant gang violence in Lowell.

Other conditions include an associational restriction that

precludes the defendant from contacting or being in the company

of individuals who are associated with TRG - Grey.2             The

government requests these supervised release conditions for two

reasons.     The first is to protect the citizens of the City of

Lowell, particularly the residents of the area surrounding

Westford Street from firearm and gang related activity.               See Map

attached as Exhibit A.3        The second is to protect the defendant

from himself by keeping him outside of areas and away from people

that will provide opportunity and temptation to commit additional

crimes.     This is critical here as the defendant’s crimes all

occurred in or around the same location in Lowell.

     This memorandum will focus on the particular facts of this

case and the specifics of the defendant’s charges in support of

the government’s request for a period of incarceration and

particularized supervised release conditions that will increase

the likelihood that the defendant will not re-offend.

     A.      Incarceration

     While the defendant has no prior criminal history, the

characteristics of the weapons sold, the defendant’s access to

weapons, and the defendant’s own statements during each

transaction suggest that he is a sophisticated dealer in

firearms.     The PSR correctly calculated the defendant’s guideline

range at 18-24 months.        For the reasons stated below, the

government believes that a sentence at the high end of the

guideline range is appropriate.

     To begin, on September 25, 2007, Hok sold a 9mm, Smith &

Wesson, model SW9VE, semi-automatic pistol with serial number

PBK7201 and two magazines to the CW in exchange for $450.00

dollars.     Notably, on September 24, 2007, in the presence of

Lowell Police Detectives, the CW placed a call to Hok for the

purpose of purchasing a firearm for $425.00.            At that time, Hok

indicated that he may be selling the firearm to another

individual, however, after subsequent negotiation, Hok agreed to

sell the CW the firearm and two magazines for $450.00.              This

suggests that the CW was not the only customer of the defendant’s

in the illegal sale of firearms.

     Additionally, according to the CW, while in the freezer area

completing the transaction, Hok indicated that the firearm had,

“no bodies on it,” and “it still has the serial numbers on it.”

Again, the use of this terminology suggests that Hok was more


                                       5
       Case 1:08-cr-10203-IT Document 34 Filed 04/28/09 Page 6 of 15



than an “casual” illegal dealer in firearms.

     On October 25, 2007, Hok sold a .40 caliber, Smith & Wesson,

model SW40VE, semi-automatic pistol with serial number PBZ5740

and 3 magazines to the CW in exchange for $650.00 dollars.             On

October 25, 2007, the CW placed a consensually recorded telephone

call to Hok to confirm a price of $650.00 for a .40 caliber

firearm.   During the conversation, the CW told Hok that he had

the $650.00 and Hok agreed to meet the CW “inside the

laundromat.”   Hok indicated that he wanted to meet at the

laundromat because there were “no cameras.”         Clearly this

statement suggests that the defendant was well aware of the

criminality of his behavior and sought to hide it.

     During the October 25, 2007 transaction, Hok confirmed

during the call that the firearm was “clean” (meaning it has not

been used in a homicide), again suggesting the defendant’s

sophistication is dealing in firearms.        This behavior also

demonstrates that the defendant is aware of not only the

illegality, but also the danger that these weapons pose when put

on the street, in the hands of gang members and, as such, it

attempting to distance himself from the weapons.

     Perhaps most telling of the defendant’s sophistication in

the illegal sale of firearms are his own statements and behavior

during the October 25, 2007 transaction.        During this

transaction, the CW and Hok engaged in conversation regarding the


                                    6
       Case 1:08-cr-10203-IT Document 34 Filed 04/28/09 Page 7 of 15



firearm, and Hok clarified that a portion of the firearm “is

polymer” and demonstrated the safety on the weapon.           Hok is

observed to be wearing plastic gloves while handling the firearm.

During the exchange, the CW asked if Hok could get additional

firearms and Hok explained that he would be able to.           The CW

asked Hok about the serial number on the firearm and Hok told the

CW not to erase it because “if you get caught with this, you do

more time without the serial number...if you take out a serial

number you do more time.”     While the defendant contends in his

Objections to the PSR that he should not be subject to the four

level enhancement for trafficking in firearms (Objection #6)

clearly his clandestine behavior in selling a firearm in a

basement while wearing gloves suggests otherwise.

     Furthermore, in addition to the sale of the firearm, the

defendant also sold the CW 3 magazines - two 10 round magazines

and one 14 round magazine.      The nature and capacity of these

magazines demonstrates the advanced nature of the defendants

dealing.

      On March 13, 2008, Hok sold a 9mm Luger caliber, S.W.D.

Incorporated, model M-11, semi-automatic pistol with serial

number XX-XXXXXXX, two muzzle attachments, 4 magazines, (2) 7.62

x 39mm cartridges, and (8) 9mm Luger live cartridges to the CW in

exchange for $900.00 dollars.      The defendant instructed the CW to

come to meet him at “Trigger’s house” because he wasn’t working


                                    7
         Case 1:08-cr-10203-IT Document 34 Filed 04/28/09 Page 8 of 15



at the liquor store.      Agents surveilled the CW to the area of

“Trigger’s” house at 27-29 Howard Street, Lowell.4

     The CW walked into the residence and engaged in the

transaction in the living room.         Hok handed the CW the firearm

and stated, “pretty nice...3 clips, 2 long ones and a short one.”

There is some conversation between the CW and a third person

(believed to be “Trigger”) regarding a silencer.            On the video,

Hok handles the weapon with a muzzle attachment and indicates, “I

think this is the one to shoot spindle and the other one shoots

straight.”    Additionally, Hok is heard inserting a clip into the

firearm and states, “This one is a 32 round clip.”            The CW tells

Hok, “this one is for the hood.”          Hok described a shorter clip

that was also with the firearm.         Again, Hok can be seen wearing

plastic gloves when handling the firearm.

     Yet again, the defendant demonstrates his familiarity in

dealing in firearms, as well as his knowledge of the illegality -

specifically the illegality that the CW was bringing the weapon

to the “hood.”     Again here, the defendant is wearing gloves while

selling a powerful firearm to a person he knows to be a gang

member, in the presence of another gang member.            This behavior



     4
       The CW knew who "Trigger" was and where "Trigger" lived.
Additionally, Det. Daniel Desmarais, through his employment with
the Lowell Police, knows "Trigger" to be Sarath Bou, a known TRG
gang member, and his residential address to be 29 Howard Street,
Lowell.


                                      8
          Case 1:08-cr-10203-IT Document 34 Filed 04/28/09 Page 9 of 15



falls well short of a person naive to the severity of this

behavior or ignorant as to the purpose in which the firearm was

to be utilized.      The only reasonable inference to be drawn from

the defendant’s wearing gloves is that the defendant himself

believed that the firearms and ammunition were going to be used

in crimes of violence and the defendant took care not to leave

any evidence that he touched the weapons.

     In addition to the firearm, the defendant sold the CW two

muzzle attachments, 4 magazines, (2) 7.62 x 39mm cartridges, and

(8) 9mm Luger live cartridges.         Two of the magazines had a 32

round capacity, one had a 12 round capacity, and one had a 10

round capacity.

     Based upon the defendant’s behavior that supports his

conviction, the government seeks a period of incarceration.               The

instant offense is serious, and the underlying circumstances show

a sophisticated and dangerous pattern of behavior that the

defendant engaged in.        The defendant’s behavior contributed to

the violence in the Westford Street area.            The nature and

circumstances of the offense, the need for deterrence, and the

need to protect the public all require that the Court impose a

sentence of incarceration within the applicable guideline range,

namely, 18-24 months.

     B.      Conditions of Release

     In order to assist the defendant’s re-integration after


                                       9
      Case 1:08-cr-10203-IT Document 34 Filed 04/28/09 Page 10 of 15



completing this sentence and assure the defendant’s continued

good behavior, the government asks the Court to consider the

following special conditions of the defendant’s supervised

release.

             i.   The Sentence Should Include an Exclusion from the
                  Westford Street area.


      This Court has broad discretion to impose appropriate

conditions of supervised release in this or any other case. Under

18 U.S.C. §3583(d), the court is directed to impose certain

mandatory conditions of release and is authorize

“any other condition it considers appropriate.”         The only

constraint on this authority is that the conditions be reasonably

related to the criteria set out in § 3553 – nature/circumstances

of the offense, history/characteristics of the defendant,

seriousness of the offense, need for future deterrence/public

protection, and need to rehabilitate the defendant.

     This Court need look no further than the text of section

3583 to conclude that an exclusionary area is an appropriate

condition.    Section 3583(d) specifically authorizes a sentencing

court to impose as a condition of supervised release any

permissive condition set forth in 3563(b)(1)-(10)- or

3563(b)(12)-(20).    Those provisions specifically allow a

sentencing court to require a defendant to “refrain from

frequenting specified kinds of places or from associating


                                   10
      Case 1:08-cr-10203-IT Document 34 Filed 04/28/09 Page 11 of 15



unnecessarily with specified persons,” to “reside in a specified

place or area, or refrain from residing in a specified place or

area,” or “remain in the jurisdiction of the court, unless

granted permission to leave by the court or a probation officer.”

     These restrictions simply make sense in this case where

much of the troubles that the defendant has experienced are

specifically related to the areas in which he worked.          It is also

clear that the Westford Street area of Lowell suffers from

substantial gang activity.     The government therefore seeks a

condition that would keep him out of that very same environment.

In United States v. Garrasteguy, 559 F.3d 34 (1st Cir. 2009), the

First Circuit recently upheld a supervised release condition that

included a geographical restriction banning the defendant from

entering an entire County where the underlying crimes were

committed in an area of that County.       See also United States v.

Smith, 436 F.3d 307 (1st Cir. 2006) (upheld a supervised release

condition that barred a defendant from seeing his young daughter;

held that a sentencing court could ask the defendant “to refrain

from frequenting specified kinds of places or from associating

unnecessarily with specified persons”); United States v.

Bolinger, 940 F.2d 478, 480 (9th Cir. 1991) ("Probation

conditions may seek to prevent reversion into former

crime-inducing lifestyle by barring contact with old haunts and

associates, even though the activities may be legal"); United


                                   11
      Case 1:08-cr-10203-IT Document 34 Filed 04/28/09 Page 12 of 15



States v. Cothran, 855 F.2d 749 (11th Cir. 1988)(validating a

probation restriction that prevented defendant, convicted of

cocaine distribution to minors, from traveling to Fulton County,

Georgia because his return to a high-crime neighborhood in

southeast Atlanta would likely result in his continued criminal

activity and the endangerment of neighborhood youth).

     Here, the defendant sold firearms on three separate

occasions.    On September 25, 2007, he sold a firearm at the

Lowell Package Store, located at 303 Westford Street.          On October

24, 2007, he sold a firearm at the Lowell Laundromat, located at

321 Westford Street, Lowell.      On March 13, 2008, the defendant

sold a firearm at 29 Howard Street, Lowell.        29 Howard Street is

.06 miles from 303 Westford Street.       Clearly, as the defendant’s

own sister relates, “the defendant needs to stay away from the

area of the liquor store.”       PSR at ¶74.


             ii.    Continued Education/Vocational training

     The defendant should be required to continue his education

while on supervised release.      At the time of incarceration, the

defendant was enrolled at the college level.         (PSR at ¶¶97-98).

             iii.   Employment

      The defendant should be required to seek and maintain

employment while on supervised release at a location other than

the family business on Westford Street in Lowell.

       Case 1:08-cr-10203-IT Document 34 Filed 04/28/09 Page 13 of 15



           iv.     Prohibition from Contacting Member or Associates
                   of TRG - Grey

      During the period of supervised release, the defendant is

prohibited from contacting or being in the company of the co-

defendants or other individuals who the government asserts are

members/associates of TRG - Grey, including, but not limited to:

Shane Carney
Vila Malakham
Saravy Sok
Sophandara Sok
Eric O’Brien
Savong Moun
Jonathan Sheehan
Sarath Bou
Jonathan Mello

II.   CONCLUSION

      The government seeks a reasonable and just sentence that

reflects the seriousness of the offense and the impact this

offense has on the Lowell community, a community plagued by

firearm and gang violence in recent years, while being mindful

that the defendant has no prior criminal history.           As such,

the government recommends that the Court impose a sentence that

includes a period of incarceration of 24 months, and a term of

supervised release of three years with certain conditions

including a geographical restriction and associational

restrictions aimed at preventing the defendant from reverting

back to criminal behavior in the Westford Street area.
