               ORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS INDICTMENT

      A defendant moves to dismiss an indictment, arguing that 18 U.S.C.

§§ 922(g)(1) and 922(k) violate his rights under the Second Amendment of the United

States Constitution and exceed Congress’ legislative power under the Commerce

Clause of Article I of the United States Constitution.         Because the defendant’s

position is contrary to clear United States Supreme Court and First Circuit Court of

Appeals precedent, the Court dismisses without prejudice the defendant’s motion to

dismiss.

I.    BACKGROUND

      On November 6, 2019, a grand jury returned a one-count indictment against

Marc Karun, charging him with possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of

18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). Indictment (ECF No. 1). On December 11, 2019, a grand jury

returned   a   two-count   superseding       indictment,   charging   Mr.   Karun   with

(1) possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), and

(2) possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number in violation of 18 U.S.C.

§ 922(k). Superseding Indictment (ECF No. 21). On August 24, 2020, Mr. Karun filed

a motion to suppress firearms and ammunition seized by police during a search of his
Case 1:19-cr-00204-JAW Document 65 Filed 07/19/21 Page 2 of 15          PageID #: 370




home. Def.’s Mot. to Suppress Evid. Obtained in Violation of the Fourth Amendment

(ECF No. 41). On January 21, 2021, the Court denied the motion to suppress. Order

on Mot. to Suppress (ECF No. 53).

      On June 1, 2021, after several extensions of time, Mr. Karun filed a motion to

dismiss the indictment, arguing that 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1) and 922(k) violate his

rights under the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and exceed

Congress’ authority under the Commerce Clause of Article I of the United States

Constitution. Def.’s Mot. to Dismiss the Indictment (ECF No. 62) (Def.’s Mot.). On

June 22, 2021, the Government responded in opposition. Gov’t Resp. to Def.’s Mot. to

Dismiss the Indictment (ECF No. 64) (Gov’t’s Opp’n). Mr. Karun did not reply.

II.   THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

      A.     Marc Karun’s Motion

      Mr. Karun asks that the Court dismiss the indictment on the grounds that 18

U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1) and 922(k) “violate his rights under the Second Amendment to the

United States Constitution and exceed the authority of Congress pursuant to the

Commerce Clause of Article I of the United States Constitution.” Def.’s Mot. at 1. He

first argues that section 922(g)(1) “is a violation of the individual right to possess

firearms guaranteed by the Second Amendment and is therefore facially

unconstitutional.” Id. at 3. Relying on the dissent of Justice Barrett, then a judge on

the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, in Kanter v. Barr, 919 F.3d 437 (7th Cir. 2019),

Mr. Karun “adopts the position that all people have an inherent right to keep and

bear arms and that no particular class of person necessarily falls outside the scope of



                                          2
Case 1:19-cr-00204-JAW Document 65 Filed 07/19/21 Page 3 of 15            PageID #: 371




the Second Amendment.”         Id. (citing Kanter, 919 F.3d at 451-52 (Barrett, J.,

dissenting)).

      Mr. Karun claims his position is supported by the United States Supreme

Court’s conclusion in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008), and that

“the word ‘people’ in the text of the Second Amendment refers to ‘all Americans.’” Id.

(citing Heller, 554 U.S. at 580). He acknowledges dicta in Heller that describe the

“longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons” as “presumptively

lawful regulatory measures,” but he argues the Heller Court “did not ‘undertake an

exhaustive historical analysis . . . of the full scope of the Second Amendment.’” Id.

(citing Heller, 554 U.S. at 626). Mr. Karun provides his own historical analysis,

attempting to undermine three historical arguments “generally offered in support” of

a categorical ban on possession of firearms by felons: (1) “some founding-era

legislatures may have prohibited felons from exercising the right to bear arms,” (2)

“the existence of capital punishment for felony offenses at the time of the founding

supports the notion that felons could also be deprived of the right to possess firearms,”

and (3) “founding-era legislatures imposed virtue-based restrictions on certain civic

rights, and the right to possess firearms is a civic right.” Id. (citing Kanter, 919 F.3d

at 454 (Barrett, J., dissenting)).

      Mr. Karun next argues that sections 922(g)(1) and 922(k) “exceed the authority

of Congress pursuant to the Commerce Clause of Article I of the United States

Constitution.” Id. at 7. Relying on Justice Thomas’ concurrence in United States v.

Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995), Mr. Karun contends that “[n]either the text nor the



                                           3
Case 1:19-cr-00204-JAW Document 65 Filed 07/19/21 Page 4 of 15          PageID #: 372




structure of Article I, section 8 support the proposition that Congress has the

authority to regulate any activity that ‘substantially affects’ interstate commerce.”

Id. at 7-8 (citing Lopez, 514 U.S. at 587-88 (Thomas, J., concurring)). He asserts that

“mere intrastate possession of a firearm is not a form of interstate commerce within

the reach of the federal criminal law” and argues that merely because “the firearms

named in the indictment were once ‘shipped and transported in interstate commerce’

does not change the fact that [Mr. Karun’s] alleged conduct involves nothing more

than possession within the State of Maine.” Id. at 9. He concludes by stating “[i]f the

federal government is to be one of limited powers, then the commerce power cannot

extend to any activity involving objects or materials that once moved across state

lines.” Id.

      B.      The Government’s Opposition

      The Government opposes Mr. Karun’s motion, arguing that neither the Second

Amendment nor the Commerce Clause argument “find support in [Mr. Karun’s] cited

authorities, and both have been rejected by the First Circuit.” Gov’t’s Opp’n at 2. The

Government first addresses Mr. Karun’s Second Amendment argument, asserting

that “Mr. Karun has been convicted of multiple violent and dangerous felonies and is

therefore appropriately barred from possessing firearms under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).”

Id. The Government quotes Heller as expressly rejecting Mr. Karun’s argument:

“[N]othing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions

on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the

carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or



                                          4
Case 1:19-cr-00204-JAW Document 65 Filed 07/19/21 Page 5 of 15          PageID #: 373




laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.” Id. at 3

(quoting Heller, 554 U.S. at 626-27) (emphasis added by the Government). The

Government next contends that “appellate courts, including the First Circuit, have

consistently upheld § 922(g)(1) after Heller,” and claims that “no circuit court to

address the issue has held that violent or otherwise dangerous felons are not

properly, and constitutionally, barred from possessing firearms.” Id. at 6-8. Finally,

the Government argues that “Mr. Karun’s criminal history and criminal conduct

place him squarely within the realm of conduct appropriately regulated by statute.”

Id. at 8.

       The Government next argues that “Congress’s restriction on possession of

firearms in Sections 922(g)(1) and 922(k) are within the scope of its Commerce Clause

powers.” Id. It contends that “[t]he charges in the indictment allege violations of

18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1) and 922(k), which each contain a jurisdictional element

relating to the possession of the firearm in interstate or foreign commerce, or to the

firearm’s own status of having previously travelled in . . . interstate or foreign

commerce.” Id. at 8-9. The Government further argues that “even if the connection

to interstate commerce had not been explicit in the subject statutes, Congress also

derives Commerce Clause authority from the substantial effect firearms have on

interstate commerce.” Id. at 9.

III.   LEGAL STANDARD

       Unlike civil actions, an indictment is not generally subject to dispositive

motion practice. United States v. Poulin, 645 F. Supp. 2d 17, 22 (D. Me. 2009); see



                                          5
Case 1:19-cr-00204-JAW Document 65 Filed 07/19/21 Page 6 of 15               PageID #: 374




also United States v. Li, 206 F.3d 56, 62 (1st Cir. 2000). “[D]ismissing an indictment

is an extraordinary step,” Li, 206 F.3d at 62 (quoting United States v. Stokes, 124

F.3d 39, 44 (1st Cir. 1997)), because, by returning an indictment, a grand jury is

carrying out a constitutionally sanctioned function. See U.S. CONST. amend. V (“No

person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on

a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury . . ..”). In the First Circuit’s words,

“[w]hen a federal court uses its supervisory power to dismiss an indictment it directly

encroaches upon the fundamental role of the grand jury.” Whitehouse v. U.S. Dist.

Ct., 53 F.3d 1349, 1360 (1st Cir. 1995).         This power is “appropriately reserved,

therefore, for extremely limited circumstances,” id. (citing Bank of Nova Scotia v.

United States, 487 U.S. 250, 263 (1988)), and should be “exercised with caution,”

United States v. Cameron, 662 F. Supp. 2d 177, 180 (D. Me. 2009).

       In addressing a challenge to an indictment, a district court must simply

determine “whether the document sketches out the elements of the crime and the

nature of the charge so that the defendant can prepare a defense and plead double

jeopardy in any future prosecution for the same offense.” United States v. Guerrier,

669 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2011) (citation omitted). The Court should not inquire into the

sufficiency of the evidence supporting the indictment. United States v. Maceo, 873

F.2d 1, 2-3 (1st Cir. 1989) (citation omitted) (“an indictment returned by a legally

constituted and unbiased grand jury, . . . if valid on its face, is enough to call for trial

of the charge on the merits”). Rather, at this stage, the Court “must accept the

allegations in the indictment as true.” United States v. Young, 694 F. Supp. 2d 25,



                                             6
Case 1:19-cr-00204-JAW Document 65 Filed 07/19/21 Page 7 of 15                          PageID #: 375




27 (D. Me. 2010) (citing Boyce Motor Lines, Inc. v. United States, 342

U.S. 337, 343 n.16 (1952)); see FED. R. CRIM. P. 12(b)(1) (“A party may raise by pretrial

motion any defense, objection, or request that the court can determine without a trial

on the merits”).

IV.     DISCUSSION

        The superseding indictment charges Mr. Karun with violating 18 U.S.C.

§§ 922(g)(1) and 922(k). Section 922(g)(1) prohibits a felon from possessing a firearm

that has been shipped or transported in interstate commerce. 1                        Section 922(k)

prohibits possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number that has been

shipped or transported in interstate commerce. 2

        The superseding indictment alleges that Mr. Karun knowingly possessed sixty

firearms, including pistols, revolvers, rifles, and a shotgun, as well as 14,632 rounds

of assorted-caliber ammunition. Superseding Indictment at 1-4. The superseding


1       Section 922(g)(1) provides:

        It shall be unlawful for any person . . . who has been convicted in any court of, a crime
        punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year . . . to ship or transport in
        interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or
        ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or
        transported in interstate or foreign commerce.

18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).

2       Section 922(k) provides:

        It shall be unlawful for any person knowingly to transport, ship, or receive, in
        interstate or foreign commerce, any firearm which has had the importer’s or
        manufacturer’s serial number removed, obliterated, or altered or to possess or receive
        any firearm which has had the importer’s or manufacturer’s serial number removed,
        obliterated, or altered and has, at any time, been shipped or transported in interstate
        or foreign commerce.

18 U.S.C. § 922(k).


                                                   7
Case 1:19-cr-00204-JAW Document 65 Filed 07/19/21 Page 8 of 15              PageID #: 376




indictment further alleges that the firearms and ammunition were shipped and

transported in interstate commerce, and that at the time of possession, Mr. Karun

knew he had been previously convicted of multiple felonies, including sexual assault

in the first degree, attempted sexual assault in the first degree, burglary in the third

degree, and larceny in the third degree. Id. at 4. Finally, the superseding indictment

alleges that Mr. Karun knowingly possessed a rifle that had been shipped and

transported in interstate commerce, and the manufacturer’s serial number had been

removed, altered and obliterated. Id. at 5.

      Notwithstanding these allegations, Mr. Karun urges the Court to dismiss the

indictment because 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1) and 922(k) violate his Second Amendment

rights and exceed Congress’ powers under the Commerce Clause.

      A.     Second Amendment

      The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution states that “[a] well

regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people

to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.” U.S. CONST. amend. II. Mr. Karun

argues that section 922(g)(1) is facially unconstitutional because “all people have an

inherent right to keep and bear arms and . . . no particular class of person necessarily

falls outside the scope of the Second Amendment.” Def.’s Mot. at 3. In Mr. Karun’s

opinion, section 922(g)(1) is facially unconstitutional because it bans an entire class

of people—namely, felons—from possessing firearms. Mr. Karun does not argue that

18 U.S.C. § 922(k) violates the Second Amendment.




                                            8
Case 1:19-cr-00204-JAW Document 65 Filed 07/19/21 Page 9 of 15             PageID #: 377




      Mr. Karun’s Second Amendment arguments are wrong as a matter of law. As

the Government notes, this Court is bound by Supreme Court and First Circuit

precedent. In District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008), the Supreme Court

recognized an individual right under the Second Amendment to bear arms and struck

down the District of Columbia’s outright ban on handgun possession. However, the

Heller Court also emphasized that “the right secured by the Second Amendment is

not unlimited” and “nothing in [its] opinion should be taken to cast doubt on

longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally

ill . . ..” 554 U.S. at 626. The Heller Court referred to felon in possession laws as

“presumptively lawful regulatory measures.” Id. at 627 n.26. The Supreme Court

has since explained that it “made it clear in Heller that [its] holding did not cast doubt

on such longstanding regulatory measures as ‘prohibitions on the possession of

firearms by felons . . ..’” McDonald v. City of Chicago, 561 U.S. 742, 786 (2010).

      In United States v. Torres-Rosario, 658 F.3d 110 (1st Cir. 2011), a defendant

convicted of violating section 922(g)(1) argued that after Heller and McDonald,

section 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional. Id. at 112. The First Circuit rejected the

defendant’s argument, noting that “[a]ll of the circuits to face the issue post Heller

have rejected blanket challenges to felon in possession laws.” Id. at 113; see id. at

113 n.1 (collecting cases). The Torres-Rosario Court explained that the Heller Court’s

statement that felon in possession bans were “presumptively lawful” “at most . . .

reserves the possibility of yet to be developed qualifications.”        Id.   “Assuming

arguendo that the Supreme Court might find some felonies so tame and technical as



                                            9
Case 1:19-cr-00204-JAW Document 65 Filed 07/19/21 Page 10 of 15            PageID #: 378




to be insufficient to justify the ban,” the First Circuit concluded that “drug dealing is

not likely to be among them.” Id. Other First Circuit precedent is in accord. See,

e.g., United States v. Booker, 644 F.3d 12, 22-26 (1st Cir. 2011) (rejecting a Second

Amendment challenge to 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9)); see also United States v. Emond, No.

2:12-cr-00044-NT, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149295, at *9-17 (D. Me. Oct. 17, 2012)

(rejecting a Second Amendment challenge to 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(3)).

      Mr. Karun acknowledges the Supreme Court’s stance in Heller but quotes the

Heller majority as saying that it did not “undertake an exhaustive historical analysis

. . . of the full scope of the Second Amendment.” Mr. Karun then supplies his own

historical analysis, leaning heavily on then-Judge Barrett’s dissent in Kanter v. Barr,

919 F.3d 437 (7th Cir. 2019). Def.’s Mot. at 3 (quoting Heller, 554 U.S. at 626).

Mr. Karun is correct that Justice Scalia’s otherwise extensive historical analysis did

not extend to cases not before the Supreme Court, and he demurred from performing

a historical exposition as to the “the full scope of the Second Amendment.” Heller,

554 U.S. at 626. Justice Scalia’s complete sentence on this subject reads:

      Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today
      of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in our opinion should
      be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of
      firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying
      of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government
      buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the
      commercial sale of arms.

Id. at 626 (emphasis supplied). Thus, to the extent the Heller majority discussed

whether the “longstanding prohibition[]” against felons possessing firearms was




                                           10
Case 1:19-cr-00204-JAW Document 65 Filed 07/19/21 Page 11 of 15           PageID #: 379




constitutional in light of the individual right to bear arms, Justice Scalia strongly

suggested that these laws would survive Heller.

      Following Heller, circuit courts have been presented with the contention that

the broad statutory ban against felons of all stripes possessing firearms conflicts with

the right of personal possession Heller recognized.       As the majority in Kanter

observed, “every federal court of appeals to address the issue has held that § 922(g)(1)

does not violate the Second Amendment on its face.”         Kanter, 919 F.3d at 442

(collecting cases from eleven circuits). As Mr. Karun has been careful to point out,

his Second Amendment challenge to § 922(g)(1) is limited to a facial challenge. Def.’s

Mot. at 6 (“Mr. Karun therefore respectfully requests that this Court dismiss the

indictment in the above-captioned matter on the grounds that the statute on which

it is based violates the Second Amendment on its face”) (emphasis supplied). There

is no reason to think that the First Circuit, if squarely presented with a facial

challenge on Second Amendment grounds to § 922(g)(1), would not join its sister

circuits in their unanimous rejection of a facial challenge to the constitutionality of

the statute.

      Even though Mr. Karun has not made an “as applied” claim of constitutional

infirmity, the only authority that gives a glimmer of hope to his Second Amendment

argument involves “as applied” challenges. The most powerful authority in favor of

constitutional limitations on section 922(g)(1) (and its Wisconsin statutory

counterpart) is Justice Barrett’s Kanter dissent, but as then-Judge Barrett pointed

out, her dissent was grounded on an as-applied, not facial challenge. Kanter, 919



                                          11
Case 1:19-cr-00204-JAW Document 65 Filed 07/19/21 Page 12 of 15          PageID #: 380




F.3d at 451 (Barrett, J., dissenting) (“[The federal and state statutes’] dispossession

of all felons—both violent and nonviolent—is unconstitutional as applied to Kanter”)

(emphasis in original).

      Yet, even if the Court charitably construes Mr. Karun’s motion as including an

“as applied” challenge, his argument still fails. In Kanter, the majority cited five

circuit courts as holding that prohibitions against felons being in possession of

firearms is “always constitutional as applied to felons as a class, regardless of their

individual circumstances or the nature of their offenses” and three circuit courts as

having “left room for as-applied challenges to the statute.” Id. at 442-43 (collecting

cases).   Discussing Torres-Rosario, the Kanter majority suggested that the First

Circuit “has not foreclosed as-applied challenges, but it has expressed some

skepticism about them.” Id. at 443.

      Even assuming that Torres-Rosario stands for the proposition that there might

be some categories of timid felons for whom the prohibition against firearm

possession could violate the Second Amendment, Mr. Karun does not fit within any

conceivable exception to the general prohibition. In her dissent in Kanter, now-

Justice Barrett was careful to point out that the conviction in that case involved mail

fraud, and therefore “the reasoning that supports the categorical disarmament of

violent felons—that past violence is predictive of future violence—simply does not

apply.” Kanter, 919 F.3d at 467 (Barrett, J., dissenting). Mr. Karun, on the other

hand, has previously been convicted of first degree sexual assault, first degree

attempted sexual assault, third degree burglary, and third degree larceny.



                                          12
Case 1:19-cr-00204-JAW Document 65 Filed 07/19/21 Page 13 of 15            PageID #: 381




“[A]ssuming arguendo that the Supreme Court might find some felonies so tame and

technical as to be insufficient to justify the ban,” violent felonies, such as the sexual

assault and burglary felonies in this case, are “not likely to be among them.” Torres-

Rosario, 658 F.3d at 113. The bottom line is that even if a case could be made that,

as applied, a ban against felons possessing firearms violates the Second Amendment,

Mr. Karun’s case is not that case.

      Whether the Court views Mr. Karun’s motion to dismiss the indictment on

Second Amendment grounds as a facial or as-applied challenge, this Court is

foreclosed from granting his motion because to do so would violate this Court’s

obligation to follow the law as pronounced by the higher courts to which this Court

owes allegiance. Eulitt v. Me. Dep’t of Educ., 386 F.3d 344, 348 (1st Cir. 2004)

(“[S]tare decisis ‘renders the ruling of law in a case binding in future cases before the

same court or other courts owing obedience to the decision’”) (quoting Gately v.

Massachusetts, 2 F.3d 1221, 1226 (1st Cir. 1993)) (emphasis in original).

      B.     Commerce Clause

      The Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution states that “Congress

shall have power . . . to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the

several states, and with the Indian tribes.” U.S. CONST., art. I, § 8, cl. 3. Mr. Karun

contends that sections 922(g)(1) and 922(k) exceed Congress’ Commerce Clause power

because the Commerce Clause does not support the proposition that “Congress has

the authority to regulate any activity that ‘substantially affects’ interstate

commerce.” Def.’s Mot. at 7. He argues that “mere intrastate possession of a firearm

is not a form of interstate commerce within the reach of the federal criminal law.” Id.

at 9.

        The Court is again bound by controlling precedent.       In United States v.

Scarborough, 431 U.S. 563 (1977), the Supreme Court established the “minimal

nexus” standard, which requires only that the firearm has traveled in interstate

commerce “at some time.” Id. at 575-77. In United States v. Wilkerson, 411 F.3d 1

(1st Cir. 2005), the First Circuit clarified that “the evidence that a firearm has

traveled at some time in interstate commerce is sufficient to establish a nexus

between the firearm and interstate commerce.” Id. at 10.

        In United States v. Roszkowski, 700 F.3d 50 (1st Cir. 2012), the defendant was

convicted under sections 922(g)(1) and 922(k). Id. at 52. The defendant challenged

his conviction on appeal, arguing that sections 922(g)(1) and 922(k) exceeded

Congress’ Commerce Clause authority, and were therefore unenforceable. Id. at 57.

The Roszkowski Court quickly rejected the defendant’s argument as “a claim which

we have repeatedly and unreservedly rejected,” and concluded that sections 922(g)

and 922(k) “reside in the heartland of Congress’s authority under the Commerce

Clause.” Id. at 57-59. See United States v. Joost, 133 F.3d 125, 131 (1st Cir. 1998)

(rejecting a Commerce Clause challenge to 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) as “hopeless”); United

States v. Diaz-Martinez, 71 F.3d 946, 953 (1st Cir. 1995) (concluding 18 U.S.C.

§ 922(k) is a valid exercise of Congress’ Commerce Clause powers).

        The Court readily rejects Mr. Karun’s argument that pursuant to United

States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995), Congress lacks the authority to regulate activity



                                          14

that “substantially affects” interstate commerce for two reasons. First, it flies in the

face of the Supreme Court’s holding that “Congress has the power to regulate

activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.” Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S.

1, 17 (2005). Second, Mr. Karun’s argument is inapposite because sections 922(g) and

922(k) both explicitly require the firearm be transported or shipped in interstate

commerce, which is enough to satisfy the minimal nexus standard.             See Diaz-

Martinez, 71 F.3d at 953 (distinguishing Lopez because section 922(k) contains a

jurisdictional element, unlike the statute at issue in Lopez).        The superseding

indictment in this case specifically alleges that Mr. Karun’s firearms had been

“shipped and transported in interstate commerce,” and he does not argue otherwise.

Superseding Indictment at 4-5. Mr. Karun may not agree with the reach of the

Commerce Clause, but this Court is bound by controlling Supreme Court and First

Circuit precedent.    See Eulitt, 386 F.3d at 348.      Therefore, the Court rejects

Mr. Karun’s Commerce Clause challenge to sections 922(g)(1) and 922(k).

V.    CONCLUSION

      The Court DISMISSES without prejudice Marc Karun’s Motion to Dismiss the

Indictment (ECF No. 62).

      SO ORDERED.
