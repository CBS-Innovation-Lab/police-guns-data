                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 11-cr-60-PB

Paul C. Gifford


                                  O R D E R


     The defendant has moved through counsel to continue the

February 7, 2012 trial in the above case, citing the need for

additional time to engage in plea negotiations or prepare for

trial.    The government does not object to a continuance of the

trial date.

     Accordingly, in order to allow the parties additional time

to properly prepare for trial, the court will continue the trial

from February 7, 2012 to March 6, 2012. In agreeing to continue

the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ' 3161

(h)(7)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the ends of justice

served in granting a continuance outweigh the best interests of

the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
