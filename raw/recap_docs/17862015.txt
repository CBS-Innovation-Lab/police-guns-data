           ORDER AFFIRMING THE RECOMMENDED DECISION
                    OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE

      On November 7, 2013, the Magistrate Judge filed with the Court her

Recommended Decision. Recommended Decision on 28 U.S.C. § 2255 Mot. (ECF No.

323). Mr. Sanchez Ramirez filed his objections to the Recommended Decision on

November 20, 2013. Def.’s Objection to Recommended Decision of Magistrate Judge

(ECF No. 276). The Court has reviewed and considered the Magistrate Judge’s

Recommended Decision, together with the entire record. The Court has made a de

novo determination of all matters adjudicated by the Magistrate Judge’s

Recommended Decision and the Court concurs with the recommendations of the

United States Magistrate Judge for the reasons set forth in her Recommended

Decision. The Court determines no further proceeding is necessary.

      In this Court’s view, the Magistrate Judge’s Recommended Decision is correct

for the procedural reasons she described in detail.      However, as Mr. Sanchez

Ramirez is incarcerated for a fifteen-year mandatory minimum, he might find a

purely procedural explanation unsatisfying. Therefore, the Court observes that, if it

reached the merits of his motion, Mr. Sanchez Ramirez’s motion would fail.
        Mr. Sanchez Ramirez contends that Alleyne v. United States, 133 S. Ct. 2151

(2013), invalidates his fifteen year mandatory minimum sentence. But the Court

found Mr. Sanchez Ramirez guilty of possession of a firearm by a felon and, as he

had been convicted of three prior burglaries, it concluded that he was subject to a

fifteen-year mandatory minimum prison term under the Armed Career Criminal

Act (ACCA).1 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1); 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1). Even if Alleyne is deemed

retroactive, a question not yet answered in the First Circuit, Mr. Sanchez Ramirez

would not benefit from its application.2 This is because, unlike a factually-based

sentencing enhancement that leads to the imposition of a mandatory minimum

statutory sentence, whether a prior crime is a predicate felony under the ACCA is a

matter of law, not fact. As the First Circuit wrote, the Alleyne Court “stated that

Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224 (1998), remains good law.”

United States v. Carrigan, 724 F.3d 39, 51 n.4 (1st Cir. 2013). The First Circuit has

explained that in Almendarez Torres, “the Supreme Court found that, where ‘the

relevant statutory subject matter is recidivism[,]’ which ‘is typical a sentencing

factor as one might imagine[,]’ a crime is not being defined and, therefore, the fact

of the prior conviction need not be mentioned in the indictment nor submitted to the

1       The Court also found Mr. Sanchez Ramirez guilty of making a false statement in acquisition
of a firearm, a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(a)(6), and of making a false claim of citizenship, a
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 911. United States v. Sanchez Ramirez, 495 F. Supp. 2d 92 (D. Me. 2007)
(Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law). However, the ACCA does not apply to either of these
convictions. See 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1) (“In the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of this title
and has three previous convictions by any court referred to in section 922(g)(1) of this title for a
violent felony . . ., such person shall be . . . imprisoned not less than fifteen years, and
notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court shall not suspend the sentence of, or grant a
probationary sentence to, such person with respect to the conviction under section 922(g)”).
2       The First Circuit may shortly be presented with the issue. On December 18, 2013, Judge D.
Brock Hornby ordered a certificate of appealability to issue on a case that raises the question of
whether Alleyne is retroactive. United States v. Butterworth, 2:06-CR-62-DBH; 2:13-CV-282-DBH,
2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 177574, * 1-2 (D. Me. Dec. 18, 2013).

                                                    2
jury.”    Id. (quoting Almendarez-Torres, 523 U.S. at 230).     Thus, “the sentence

imposed on [the defendant] pursuant to the ACCA was based on a determination of

a sentencing factor, not a determination of an element of an offense.” Id. As a

consequence, even if Alleyne is deemed retroactive (which it may not be), Mr.

Sanchez Ramirez would not have been entitled to have the prior qualifying

convictions listed in the indictment and put before a jury for resolution as a

question of fact.

         At the sentencing hearing, the Court determined as a matter of law that at

least three of his previous felony convictions for burglary qualified as ACCA

predicates.    United States v. Sanchez Ramirez, CR-05-71-B-W, 2007 U.S. Dist.

LEXIS 94146 (D. Me. Dec. 21, 2007). On June 30, 2009, the First Circuit upheld

these sentencing determinations. United States v. Sanchez Ramirez, 570 F.3d 75,

81-83 (1st Cir. 2009). In his latest motion, Mr. Sanchez Ramirez has not challenged

his underlying convictions; he has only challenged the legal significance of his prior

convictions and the Court’s legal conclusion that three of them qualified as

predicate felonies for purposes of the ACCA. As such, the Supreme Court’s teaching

in Alleyne about the right to a jury trial for factual determinations that result in a

mandatory minimum sentence does not apply here.

         For the reasons in the Magistrate Judge’s Recommended Decision and the

reasons set forth herein, the Court overrules Cosme Sanchez Ramirez’s objection to

the Recommended Decision of the Magistrate Judge and AFFIRMS the Magistrate

Judge’s Recommended Decision (ECF No. 323). The Court further DENIES the



                                          3
Motion to Vacate, Set Aside or Correct Sentence (2255) (ECF No. 320). Following

his objection, Mr. Sanchez Ramirez filed a motion to appoint counsel. Def.’s Mot. to

Appoint Counsel (ECF No. 325).        The Court DENIES that motion.       See United

States v. Allen, 1:03-cr-00058-JAW, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 105490 (D. Me. Jul. 29,

2013).

         It is also ORDERED that a certificate of appealability shall not issue in the

event Cosme Sanchez Ramirez files a notice of appeal because there has been no

substantial showing of a denial of a constitutional right within the meaning of 28

U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).

         SO ORDERED.
