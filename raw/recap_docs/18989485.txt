                 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                       DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America,
     Plaintiff

            v.                            Case No. 11-cr-126-01-SM

Clay Humphrey,
     Defendant

                                 O R D E R


       Defendant Humphrey’s motion to continue the final pretrial

conference and trial is granted         (document no. 10).       Defendant

Humphrey has filed a Waiver of Speedy Trial.          Trial has been

rescheduled for the month of February 2012.

       The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting

a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in

that failure to grant a continuance would unreasonably deny the

defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence

under the circumstances.

       Final Pretrial Conference      is rescheduled for February 10,

2012    at 11:30 a.m. in    Room 421.

       Jury selection will take place on February 22, 2012 at 9:30

a.m.
