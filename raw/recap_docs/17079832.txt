                        MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
                            May 11, 2007

     Defendant Eddie Gautier (“Gautier”) moves to suppress a

handgun found by a search of his person, and statements made

following his arrest.

     Based on the testimony presented at the hearing, Defendant’s

Motion to Suppress Physical Evidence and Statements (document

#19) is DENIED.   Officer Blas testified that a companion of

Gautier’s said, in his direction, “Get the burner.”         If I believe

that testimony, then I must also conclude that the police had

probable cause to search all of the men in the group.          Terry v.

Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968).    Mr. Gautier vigorously denies the

statement was made.   His further argument that it would be

implausible for men who “knew the drill” to suggest armed

resistance to officers makes sense, except that he also admitted

that all of the men were drunk at the time.        Additionally, I note

that Officer Marrero, also on the scene, did not hear the alleged

statement; but that is not devastating to the government’s case,

as Officer Marrero was standing on the far side of Gautier on the

sidewalk.

     The standard for evaluating this testimony is lenient:           a

fair preponderance of the evidence.      But I cannot conclude based

on that standard that Officer Blas was not telling the truth.

Cf. United States v. Dessesaure, 314 F. Supp. 2d 81 (D. Mass.

April 13, 2004) rev’d on other grounds, 429 F.3d 359 (1st Cir.

Nov. 30, 2005).

     I also note that defendant does not dispute the presence of

at least one open container of alcohol, an arrestable offense.

Had the police chosen to arrest the men for the open container,

they would have been entitled to search the defendant incident to

the arrest.   Chimel v California, 395 U.S. 752, 762-63 (1969).

     The government is, however, incorrect in its assertion that

the defendant was arrestable on sight for trespassing.          Despite

the government’s conclusory statement in its brief that the

Boston Housing Authority “had served notice on Gautier barring

him from the premises,” there is no evidence that any valid no-

trespass order existed against him.      Indeed, he was an invitee of

his mother, who is an Archdale resident, and he testified that he

had coached basketball at the Archdale community center.          The

police officers’ prior orders that he stay out of the Archdale

Complex have no force of law.     Massachusetts General Laws,

Chapter 266, § 120, provides in relevant part:



          Whoever, without right enters or remains in
          or upon the dwelling house, buildings, boats
          or improved or enclosed land, wharf, or pier

           of another . . . after having been forbidden
           so to do by the person who has lawful control
           of said premises . . . shall be punished [by
           a fine and/or imprisonment] . . . . A person
           who is found committing such trespass may be
           arrested by a sheriff, deputy sheriff,
           constable or police officer . . . .


(Emphasis supplied).     Ownership and control of public housing

authority property is given to the housing authority, not the

police.   Mass. Gen. L. Ch. 121B, §§ 26, 32, 32C.          The police may

communicate no-trespass orders at the behest of the housing

authority, but they have no legal power to issue them at their

own whim to invitees of legal residents.

     As the search was lawful, defendant’s later statements

concerning it are not fruit of the poisonous tree.

     Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion to Suppress Physical

Evidence and Statements (document #19) is DENIED.



SO ORDERED.
