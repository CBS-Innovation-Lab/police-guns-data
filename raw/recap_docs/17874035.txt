                               FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND



UNITED STATES OF AMERICA


                  v.                                                                      CR No. 09-071-ML


JOSE MALDONADO.



                                     MEMORANDUM AND ORDER

         Jose Maldonado (“Maldonado”), proceeding pro se, has filed a motion pursuant to 28

U.S.C. § 2255, to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. 1 For the reasons set forth below,

Maldonado’s motion is denied. 2

                                           I. Background and Travel

         In April 2009, federal agents executed a search warrant on Maldonado and his Warwick,

Rhode Island apartment. United States v. Maldonado, 708 F.3d 38 (1st Cir. 2013). The agents

discovered crack and powder cocaine, a digital scale, over $6,500, and a driver’s license which

indicated that Maldonado lived in Cranston, Rhode Island. Id. After Maldonado was arrested

and received his Miranda 3 warnings, Maldonado spoke with agents. Id. Maldonado explained

that he operated his drug business from Warwick in order to insulate his family, in Cranston,

from the dangers associated with his occupation. Id. After securing Maldonado’s consent,

agents searched the Cranston address and discovered a hidden compartment in a closet. Id.

  Since Maldonado has filed this motion pro se, the Court construes his motion liberally. United States v. Stierhoff,
Cr. No. 06-42 ML, 2011 WL 6003888 (D.R.I. November 30, 2011.)

  Maldonado filed his initial motion in March of 2013. He filed a second motion, before the Court ruled on his
initial motion, in July of 2013.

  Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).

                                                          1
Inside the compartment agents found two handguns, ammunition, drugs, and scales. In a tape-

recorded confession, Maldonado admitted he had been dealing drugs for about a year and he

acknowledged his ownership of the handguns. Id. Agents also discovered crack and powder

cocaine and heroin in Maldonado’s vehicle. Id.

       Maldonado was charged with two counts of possession with the intent to distribute

heroin, two counts of possession with the intent to distribute cocaine base, one count of

possession with the intent to distribute cocaine powder, and one count of possession of two

firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. A jury convicted Maldonado on all counts.

Id. He was sentenced to one hundred and eighty-one months in prison and five years of

supervised release. Id. Maldonado appealed his conviction to the First Circuit; the First Circuit

affirmed the conviction. Id.

       Maldonado argues that his counsel was ineffective because, on appeal, counsel failed to

argue that Maldonado “did not actively use or carry a firearm in relation to the drug offense,”

and because counsel failed to object to a sentencing enhancement.     Motion To Vacate at 4-5;

Docket #136. Maldonado also contends that the Government improperly coerced him into

entering a guilty plea by threatening to prosecute his wife.

                                      II. Standard of Review

       Pursuant to section 2255:

          [a] prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of
          Congress claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence
          was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or
          that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the
          sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise
          subject to collateral attack, may move the court which imposed the sentence
          to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.




                                                 2
28 U.S.C. § 2255(a). Relief under Section 2255 is available only if the Court finds a lack of

jurisdiction, constitutional error, or a fundamental error of law. See United States v. Addonizio,

442 U.S. 178, 185 (1979) (holding that “an error of law does not provide a basis for [a] collateral

attack unless the claimed error constituted a fundamental defect which inherently results in a

complete miscarriage of justice”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A fundamental

error of law is a defect “which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice or an

omission inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.” Knight v. United States,

37 F.3d 769, 772 (1st Cir. 1994) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

       A prisoner seeking relief under § 2255 is procedurally barred from raising issues not

presented on direct appeal unless he demonstrates “cause and prejudice . . . or, alternatively, that

he is actually innocent.” Hughes v. United States, 241 F. Supp. 2d 148, 152 (D.R.I. 2003)

(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Generally, claims of sentencing errors are not

cognizable in a § 2255 proceeding absent “exceptional circumstances;” however, a petition does

not face the same hurdle for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel regarding sentencing.

Knight, 37 F.3d at 773–74.

       Under the Sixth Amendment, each defendant is guaranteed the right to effective

assistance of counsel. To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner

must show: that (1) counsel’s performance was deficient, i.e. “counsel's representation fell below

an objective standard of reasonableness;” and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the

defense, i.e. “a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of

the proceeding would have been different.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 688, 694

(1984). “A failure to show prejudice will suffice to defeat a particular claim, without reference




                                                 3
to the level of counsel’s performance.” Nguyen v. United States, 230 F. Supp. 2d 94, 96 (D. Me.

2002).

         The Court may, without holding an evidentiary hearing, dismiss a § 2255 motion if “it

plainly appears on the face of the pleadings that the petitioner is not entitled to the requested

relief, or if the allegations . . . consist of no more than conclusory prognostication and perfervid

rhetoric. . . .” Moreno-Espada v. United States, 666 F.3d 60, 66 (1st Cir. 2012) (internal

quotation marks and citation omitted).

                                          III. Discussion

                                 A. Second or Successive Motion

         Generally, a district court may not entertain a second or successive § 2255 motion unless

the Court of Appeals has certified such action. See generally 28 U.S.C. §§ 2244; Trenkler v.

United States, 536 F.3d 85 (1st Cir. 2008). However, “when a § 2255 motion is filed before

adjudication of an initial § 2255 motion is complete, the district court should construe the second

§ 2255 motion as a motion to amend the pending § 2255 motion.” United States v. Allen, Cr.

No. 06-10170-MLW, 2013 WL 6838162, at *10 (D. Mass. Dec. 24, 2013) (internal quotation

marks and citation omitted); see also United States v. Ciampi, 419 F.3d 20 (1st Cir. 2005)

(amendments to § 2255 motions are controlled by Fed. R. Civ. P. 15).

         Maldonado filed his initial motion to vacate on March 6, 2013. On July 29, 2013, before

the Court ruled on his initial motion, Maldonado filed a second § 2255 motion. The Court

assumes, without deciding, that Maldonado’s second filing is a timely motion to amend his initial

filing. See generally Allen, 2013 WL 6838162, at *10.




                                                 4
                              B. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel

       Maldonado argues his counsel was ineffective because, on appeal, counsel failed to argue

that Maldonado did not actively use or carry a firearm to advance his drug trafficking exploits.

Maldonado, however, was not charged with, or convicted of, actively using or carrying a firearm.

Maldonado was charged with violating 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A), possessing a firearm in

furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. To prove possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug

trafficking crime, the government had to prove that Maldonado “committed a drug trafficking

crime; . . . knowingly possessed a firearm; and . . . possessed the firearm in furtherance of the

drug trafficking crime.” United States v. Bobadilla-Pagan, 747 F.3d 26, 35 (1st Cir. 2014). A

violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A) requires a “sufficient nexus between the firearm and the

drug crime such that the firearm advances or promotes the drug crime.” United States v. Gurka,

605 F.3d 40, 44 (1st Cir. 2010). “Constructive possession,” under § 924(c), is defined as “the

power and intention to exercise dominion and control over a firearm directly or through others.”

United States v. Rodriguez–Lozada, 558 F.3d 29, 40 (1st Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks

and citation omitted).

       The evidence was clear that Maldonado committed a drug trafficking crime. Maldonado

admitted that he owned the firearms and the evidence reflected that the firearms and drugs were

stored closely together at the Cranston address; thus both the nexus to drug trafficking and the

possession requirements of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A) were satisfied. See generally Bobadilla-

Pagan, 747 F.3d at 35 (noting “the proximity of the firearm to drugs or contraband” is a factor to

be considered under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)). The Government was not required to prove that

Maldonado used or physically carried the firearms. Thus, counsel’s failure to argue that




                                                 5
Maldonado did not use or carry a firearm on appeal did not prejudice Maldonado. This claim

fails. See generally Nguyen, 230 F. Supp. 2d 94.

       Next, Maldonado claims that his counsel was ineffective because counsel did not object

to a sentencing enhancement for the possession of a firearm.            See generally U.S.S.G. §

2D1.1(b)(1). Maldonado’s offense level was not enhanced under § 2D1.1 of the guidelines.

Therefore, any objection by counsel would have been meritless as the enhancement was never

included. See generally Strickland, 466 U.S. 668.

                                   C. Prosecutorial Misconduct

       Maldonado contends that his “[g]uilty plea [was] induced by [a] promise or coercion that

his wife would not be prosecuted . . . if [Maldonado] entered a [g]uilty [p]lea. . . .” Motion To

Vacate at 6; Docket at #136. It is not clear, however, if Maldonado argues that his counsel was

ineffective because he failed to raise the alleged prosecutorial misconduct issue. Maldonado’s

lack of clarity in his argument, however, is of no moment because the argument is wholly

unsupported.

       To qualify for § 2255 relief, prosecutorial misconduct must have violated Maldonado’s

due process rights. Moreno-Morales v. United States, 334 F.3d 140 (1st Cir. 2003).

Maldonado’s claim of prosecutorial misconduct plainly fails because he did not enter a guilty

plea. He chose to submit the charges against him to a jury and that jury ultimately found

Maldonado guilty.

                                       D. Other Arguments

       Maldonado raises several other arguments in his filings. Any argument that the Court has

not specifically addressed herein has been carefully reviewed and found to be without merit.




                                                 6
                                           IV. Conclusion

         Maldonado’s motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence is denied and dismissed.

                                     Certificate of Appealabilty

         Pursuant to Rule 11(a) of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings for the United

States District Courts, this Court hereby finds that this case is not appropriate for the issuance of

a certificate of appealability because Maldonado has failed to make “a substantial showing of the

denial of a constitutional right” as required by 28 U.S.C. 2253(c)(2).

         Maldonado is further advised that any motion to reconsider this ruling will not extend the

time to file a notice of appeal in this matter. See Rules Governing Section 2255 Cases, Rule

11(a).



SO ORDERED.
