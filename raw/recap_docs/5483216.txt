                  (Use Section VIII if necessary.)

                  G    substantial assistance (18 U.S.C. § 3553(e))

                                                            STATEMENT OF REASONS

 VII COURT DETERMINATIONS OF RESTITUTION

       A     ✔
             G      Restitution Not Applicable.

       B      Total Amount of Restitution:

       C      Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

              1     G    For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
                         identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

              2     G    For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
                         issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
                         that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(B).

              3     G    For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
                         ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh
                         the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(1)(B)(ii).

              4     G    Restitution is not ordered for other reasons. (Explain.)




       D      G     Partial restitution is ordered for these reasons (18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)):
