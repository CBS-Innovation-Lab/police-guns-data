                      UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                           DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

             v.                                   Case No. 06-cr-19-01/02-SM

Starr Parrish and
Douglas Fisher


                                         ORDER



       Defendant Fisher's assented-to motion to continue the trial (document no. 30) is

granted. Trial has been rescheduled for the September 2006 trial period. Defendant Fisher

shall file a Waiver of Speedy Trial Rights not later than July 5, 2006. On the filing of such

waiver, his continuance shall be effective.

       The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance outweigh

the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ยง

3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would unreasonably deny the

defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective preparation taking into account the
