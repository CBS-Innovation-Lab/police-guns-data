                   IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                     FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO


 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

          Plaintiff,

              v.                           CRIM. NO. 01-00615-2 (RAM)

 MIGUEL FLECHA-MALDONADO,

          Defendant.



                              OPINION AND ORDER

     RAÚL M. ARIAS-MARXUACH, United States District Judge

     This matter comes before the Court on the United States

Probation Office’s (“Probation Office”) Motion Requesting Early

Termination of Supervised Release Term (Docket No. 253) and the

United States of America’s (“the Government”) opposition thereto.

(Docket No. 259). The Probation Office’s Motion at Docket No. 253

is DENIED for the reasons set forth below.

                                I.    BACKGROUND

     On    August      9,   2001,    Defendant   Miguel   Flecha-Maldonado

(“Flecha-Maldonado”) was charged in a three-count indictment with

conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute ten (10) kilograms

of cocaine and the use of firearm in furtherance of a drug-

trafficking crime. (Docket No. 2). He went to trial and was found

guilty of all counts on May 10, 2002. (Docket Nos. 147 and 148).
      Case 3:01-cr-00615-RAM Document 260 Filed 05/28/20 Page 2 of 9
Criminal No. 01-00615-2 (RAM)                                             2


     On September 30, 2002, he was sentenced to a term of 220

months of imprisonment by now-retired U.S. District Judge José A.

Fusté. (Docket No. 165). Judge Fusté also sentenced Mr. Flecha-

Maldonado to a term of supervised release of five (5) years for

Counts 1 and 2 and a term of three (3) years of supervised release

for Count 3, the latter term to be served concurrently with the

term for Counts 1 and 2. Id. Defendant appealed to the First

Circuit which affirmed Judge Fusté on June 20, 2016. (Docket No.

251). Mr. Flecha-Maldonado began supervised release on February 5,

2018. (Docket No. 253 at 1). He is expected to end supervised

release on February 4, 2023. Id.

     On April 21, 2020, the Probation Office filed its Motion

Requesting   Early      Termination   of    Supervised       Release   Term

(“Motion”). (Docket No. 253). The United States filed a Motion in

Compliance with Court’s Order and in Opposition to USPO’s Request

for Early Termination of Supervised Release Term (“Opposition”) on

May 15, 2020. (Docket No. 259).

     In a nutshell, the Probation Office contends that Mr. Flecha-

Maldonado’s “adjustment to supervision and reintegration to the

community has been very good.” (Docket No. 253 at 2). He has

complied   with   all   the   conditions   of   supervised    release,   is

gainfully employed and is complying with the conditions of the Low

Intensity Program of Supervision. Id. at 2-3. Lastly, the Probation

Office concludes that “no concerns have been identified by the
       Case 3:01-cr-00615-RAM Document 260 Filed 05/28/20 Page 3 of 9
Criminal No. 01-00615-2 (RAM)                                                 3


U.S.    Probation    Officer   as   to    offender’s   request    for     being

considered for early termination.” Id. at 4.

       The Government objects because compliance with the conditions

of supervised release is expected and the Probation Office’s Motion

has    not   shown    exceptional        or   extraordinary    circumstances

warranting early termination. (Docket No. 259). The Government

also suggests that terminating supervision at this time would be

tantamount to eschewing the sentencing Judge’s rationale. The

Opposition posited that “[t]here is a reason for which the Judge

presiding    over    defendant’s    sentencing    hearing     concluded   that

defendant had [to] be subject to a five-year term of supervised

release.” Id. at 2.

       While Mr. Flecha-Maldonado is commended for a reportedly

successful reintegration into society, the Court must deny the

Probation Office’s Motion. As discussed below, compliance with the

conditions of supervision does not serve as a basis for early

termination and the pending Motion does not state or show any

“exceptional circumstances” meriting the requested relief.

                               II. APPLICABLE LAW

       Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(1), and having considered the

sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. § 3553, a Court may “terminate a

term of supervised release and discharge the defendant released at

any time after the expiration of one year of supervised release

[…] if it is satisfied that such action is warranted by the conduct

Criminal No. 01-00615-2 (RAM)                                               4


of the defendant released and the interest of justice.” (emphasis

added). See also United States v. McGovern, 2020 WL 589553, at *2

(D.P.R. 2020). Early termination of supervision is not granted as

a matter of course. See United States v. Melvey, 2018 WL 6624193,

at *2 (E.D.N.Y. 2018) (citation omitted).

     As explained by the Second Circuit:

            Occasionally,     changed     circumstances-for
            instance, exceptionally good behavior by the
            defendant   or   a   downward    turn   in  the
            defendant's   ability   to   pay   a   fine  or
            restitution imposed as conditions of release
            will render a previously imposed term or
            condition of release either too harsh or
            inappropriately tailored to serve the general
            punishment goals of section 3553(a).

United   States    v.   Lussier,   104   F.3d   32,   36   (2nd Cir.    1997).

Moreover, “the law is clear that only ‘exceptional cases’ involving

‘special, extraordinary, or unforeseen circumstance[s]’ warrant

early termination.” Wittingham v. United States, 2017 WL 2257347,

at *6 (S.D.N.Y. 2017). By way of example, “early termination may

be justified where conditions of supervised release hinder a fully

compliant defendant’s ability to obtain employment and reintegrate

into society.” Id. (citation omitted); see also United States v.

Arellano,   2016    U.S.   Dist.   LEXIS   187134,    *3    (S.D.N.Y.   2016)

(granting termination of supervised release one year early where

fully compliant supervisee was a salaried truck driver and the

conditions of supervision “impede[d] him from obtaining a better

and more secure job” with UPS or FedEx, “for which he ha[d] applied

Criminal No. 01-00615-2 (RAM)                                                        5


and otherwise [was] eligible”). Similarly, in United States v.

Jiménez    the     Court    held     that early termination of            supervised

release was proper due to defendant's compliance and medical

issues, which       included    partial     paralysis      and     slurred      speech

because of a stroke. See United States v. Jiménez, 2012 WL 3854785,

at *1 (S.D.N.Y. 2012). Crucially, “compliance with the terms and

conditions    of     ...    supervised     release,       though       laudable,    is

generally not grounds for early termination.” United States v.

Farmer, 2015 WL 6527542, at *2 (D. Me. 2015) (quotation omitted)

(emphasis added).

                                III. DISCUSSION

      Laudable     as    Mr.   Flecha-Maldonado’s         new    path     is,    early

termination of supervision is not warranted in the present case.

The   Probation     Office’s    Motion     did   not   show      any    “exceptional

circumstances” such as “exceptionally good behavior” or hindrance

to    Defendant’s       employment    or   educational      opportunities.         See

Wittingham, 2017 WL 2257347, at *6. As noted in the background

section, the Probation Office asserts that Mr. Flecha-Maldonado’s

“adjustment to supervision and reintegration to the community has

been very good.” (Docket No. 253 at 2). In support of this

assertion,   the     Probation       Office’s    Motion   offers       details     that

indicate that Mr. Flecha-Maldonado made good use of the educational

opportunities available to him in prison, has sought to advance

professionally, and has not recidivated or otherwise violated the
      Case 3:01-cr-00615-RAM Document 260 Filed 05/28/20 Page 6 of 9
Criminal No. 01-00615-2 (RAM)                                                        6


conditions of supervision. Id. at 2-3. However, “[v]ery good

behavior” falls short of “exceptionally good behavior.” See United

States    v.    Branscumb,        2019     WL    6501208,     at   *3    (C.D.   Ill.

2019), report and recommendation adopted, 2019 WL 6499067 (C.D.

Ill. 2019) (“Generally, the conduct of a defendant must establish

more than simply successfully complying with the terms of his

supervision, for if this were simply enough, nearly every defendant

who avoided revocation would be eligible for early termination.”)

Nor has the Probation Office shown that Mr. Flecha-Maldonado’s

prospects for professional or education advancement have been

hindered. Instead, the Probation Office states that Mr. Flecha-

Maldonado      has    already     traded    up    in   full-time    employment    and

enrolled in a continuing education course. (Docket No. 253 at 2-

3).   Notably,        these     auspicious       professional      and   educational

developments have occurred while Mr. Flecha-Maldonado has been

under supervision.

      Turning        to   Section     3553’s     sentencing     factors,      adequate

deterrence would be diminished if early termination of supervised

release is dispensed freely. Especially since “[t]he supervised

release   term       serves   a     broader,     societal   purpose      by   reducing

recidivism.” United States v. Jeanes, 150 F.3d 483, 485 (5th Cir.

1998). Furthermore, the fact that “[s]upervised release fulfills

rehabilitative ends, distinct from those served by incarceration”

must be considered. United States v. Powell, 2015 WL 8957629, at
       Case 3:01-cr-00615-RAM Document 260 Filed 05/28/20 Page 7 of 9
Criminal No. 01-00615-2 (RAM)                                                        7


*1 (D. Me. 2015) (quotation omitted). Thus, Mr. Flecha-Maldonado’s

positive    reintegration        into    the     community    could     suffer      as

“Congress intended supervised release to assist individuals in

their transition to community life.” See United States v. Johnson,

529 U.S. 53, 59 (2000); see also United States v. Jackson, 426

F.3d 301, 305 (5th Cir. 2005) (“Shortening the period of supervised

release reduces the amount of time a former prisoner is monitored

by the system and undermines the rehabilitative goals Congress

pursued    in    enacting    §   3624   [which     governs    the    release   of    a

prisoner].” Mr. Flecha-Maldonado is seemingly thriving under the

least intrusive level of supervision and this also weighs in favor

of maintaining the status quo.

       Lastly,    the    Court   has    also   considered     that    Mr.    Flecha-

Maldonado had not completed even 50% of his supervised release

term when the Probation Office filed its motion on April 21, 2020.

(Docket No. 259 at 1). Considering the seriousness of the offenses

for which he was convicted, additional time under supervision

should have elapsed before countenancing early termination of

supervision. See e.g. United States v. Friel, 2010 WL 3851964 (D.

Me. 2010) (denying early termination to defendant convicted of

conviction of possession of a firearm by a felon and possession

with   intent    to     distribute     marijuana    because    only    50%   of   the

supervised release term had elapsed and the Probation Office

typically waited until 70% had elapsed before moving for early

termination); see also, United States v. Slay, 2010 WL 1006713, at

*1 (D. Utah 2010) (holding that where only two of the five years

of supervised release had passed, even if defendant’s conduct was

“commendable,” termination of supervised release was not proper

because “it is still too early to determine if early termination”

of supervised release “[was] both warranted by the conduct of the

offender and is in the interest of justice.”).

     All told, the Probation Office’s Motion does not show that

early termination of supervision, currently at the lowest level,

is warranted under Section 3553 (a)’s sentencing factors and is in

the “interest of justice” as required by Section 3563(e)(1).

                            IV. CONCLUSION

     “[M]odel prison conduct and full compliance with the terms of

supervised release is what is expected of [defendant] and all

others serving terms of imprisonment and supervised release and

does not warrant early termination.” United States v. Weintraub,

371 F.Supp. 2d 164, 166-167 (D. Conn. 2005) (quotation omitted).

Mr. Flecha-Maldonado’s conduct is commended but the United States

Probation   Office    has   not    shown    exceptional    circumstances

warranting early termination of supervised release.

     The Motion for Early Termination of Supervised Release at

Docket No. 253 is DENIED.
