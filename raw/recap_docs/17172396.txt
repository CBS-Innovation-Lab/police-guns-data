                          MEMORANDUM AND ORDER

WOLF, D.J.                                                March 17, 2008

     Defendant Jose Guzman is serving a 210 month sentence for,

among other things, conspiring to possess cocaine base with intent

to distribute it.      As a result of Amendment 706 to the United

States   Sentencing     Guidelines       ("U.S.S.G."),   which   generally

retroactively reduces by two levels the offense level for crimes

involving crack cocaine and became effective March 3, 2008, Guzman

moved for a reduction of his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C.

§3582(c)(2) and U.S.S.G. §2B1.10 (the "Motion").            As Guzman is

indigent, counsel was appointed to represent him. The government

has responded to the Motion.

     The government correctly acknowledges that Guzman is eligible

for a reduction of his sentence.         It also asserts that no hearing

is necessary or appropriate.         See Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(b)(4)

(stating that defendant need not be present for a reduction of

sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)).           The government recommends

that Guzman receive the full benefit of the retroactive amendment

because "neither considerations of public safety, nor defendant's

conduct while in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons, warrants

denial    of    the    sentence     reduction   to   which   he   is    otherwise

entitled."           Government's    Response   to   Defendant's       Motion   for

Reduction of Sentence at 6-7 n.2; see also U.S.S.G. §1B1.10. A.N.

1(B)(ii) & (iii).           Therefore, the government requests that to

implement this recommendation the court resentence the defendant to

"Time Served."

     The court agrees.           Therefore, it is hereby ORDERED that:

     1.        The Motion (Docket No. 123) is ALLOWED.

     2.        The defendant's sentence is REDUCED to Time Served.

     3.        The term and conditions of Supervised Release previously

imposed are not altered.

     4.        The    attached    Order   Regarding    Motion     for    Sentence

Reduction Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §3582(c)(2) and an Amended Judgment

shall enter forthwith.
