MEMORANDUM AND ORDER

Damien Gouse has filed a Motion to Dismiss under the Interstate Agreement of
Detainers (“IAD”) 18 U.S.C. App 2 § 2 on the grounds that the federal government’s use of the
writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum (“writ”) resulted in three violations of the LAD Art. IV
(a) and the government’s attempt to avoid the LAD led to a further violation of the anti-
shuttling provisions contained in both Art. III (d) and Art. IV (e). (See ECF No. 17 at 9.) Mr.
Gouse also asserts the dismissal of the government’s claims should be with prejudice. (ECF No.
17 at 10.) Because this Court finds that the government did not lodge a detainer against Mr.
Gouse in the present indictment, the IAD was not violated and therefore l\/lr. Gouse’s Motion to
Dismiss is DENIED.

I. BACKGROUND

Although certain key facts are in dispute, Magistrate Judge David L. Martin, in an earlier
opinion in this case, laid out a fairly complete chronology. See Opinion and Order Overruling
Defendant’s Objectl'on to Arraignment. (ECF No. 7 at 3-7.) Mr. Gouse is charged in the instant

indictment with being a felon in possession of a firearm, possession with intent to distribute

grams or more of cocaine base, and using and possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug
trafficking crime. Ia’. at 2.

On November 29, 2007 Providence police officers arrested Gouse, and he was charged
in Rhode Island state court with narcotics and firearms offenses. Id. at 3. On February 1, 2008,
while free on bail, Mr. Gouse failed to appear in state court. Id. The federal government then
filed a complaint on February 8, 2008, in United States District Court for the District of Rhode
Island, charging him with offenses related to the state charges. Id. Magistrate Judge Lincoln D.
Almond signed a warrant for his arrest on these charges. Ia'.

On March 13, 2008 Mr. Gouse was charged in Massachusetts with offenses unrelated to
the charges pending against him in Rhode Island and after trial was sentenced to fifteen years
confinement Id. at 4. A federal warrant, not a detainer, was then forwarded to the
Massachusetts state facility where Mr. Gouse was incarcerated Id. Mr. Gouse submitted a
request for disposition of the pending federal complaint under the IAD, Art. l]l on October l,
2009, although no federal detainer had yet been lodged against him.l Id. This Court docketed
Mr. Gouse’s IAD request on October 5, 2009.

On October 15, 2009, Mr. Gouse was transferred from Massachusetts to the Rhode
Adult Correctional Institution (“ACl”) and arraigned in Rhode Island state court. Id. at 5. On the
the same date, a federal detainer was lodged against Mr. Gouse. Ia’. Magistrate Judge Almond

held an initial appearance for Mr. Gouse on October 19, 2009 Where Mr. Gouse agreed to a

 

l Mr. Gouse disagrees and claims the record is unclear as to whether a detainer had been
lodged at this point, but he claims it is clear he had notice under the IAD of the charges pending
against him and requested to be taken to Rhode Island to bring about final disposition of those
charges. Id.

Case 1:11-cr-00112-I\/|-PAS Document 37 Filed 06/18/13 Page 3 of 8 Page|D #: 382

waiver under the L¢XD.2 Id. On December 2, 2009 a federal grand jury returned an indictment
against Mr. Gouse on his federal charges. Id.

Because of the federal indictment, the State of Rhode Island dismissed charges against
Mr. Gouse on January 8, 2010. Id. The State of Rhode Island then transferred Mr. Gouse from
the ACI back to Massachusetts state custody without notifying United States Marshall Service
on February 10, 2010. Id. at 6.

On March 17, 2010 the federal government filed a motion to dismiss the indictment in
the prior action without prejudice. Id. Mr. Gouse filed an objection and filed a cross-motion to
dismiss the indictment with prejudice. Id. United States District Judge William E. Smith granted

the government’s motion to dismiss the indictment without prejudice on Apri19, 2010. Id.

Mr. Gouse was indicted in the present action on June 29, 2011. Id. On June 30, 2011, a
writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum was signed, and on July 12, 2011 United States
Marshalls moved Mr. Gouse from Massachusetts to the Wyatt Detention Center in Rhode
Island. Id. Mr. Gouse appeared in court on July 13, 2011 for his arraignment, objected to the
arraignment proceeding, and asked to be returned to Massachusetts state custody. Id. at 6-7.
'[his Court denied Mr. Gouse’s request. Id. at 7.

The federal government filed a memorandum concerning the applicability of the LAD on
July 20, 2011. (ECFNo. 5.) Mr. Gouse filed his response on July 22, 2011. (ECF No. 6.) On
August 5, 2011 this Court held a hearing on Mr. Gouse’s objection to the arraignment

proceeding and his renewed request to return to Massachusetts custody. (ECF No. 7.) This

 

2 Mr. Gouse disagrees and maintains the only waiver he made was a “waiver of his right not to
be shuttled back and forth between Rhode Island state custody at the ACI and the United States
District Court in Providence.” Id.

Case 1:11-cr-00112-I\/|-PAS Document 37 Filed 06/18/13 Page 4 of 8 Page|D #: 383

Court found that the lAD was not violated and overruled Mr. Gouse’s objection to the
arraignment and his request to be returned to Massachusetts Id. at 10.

On December 19, 2011 Mr. Gouse filed this Motion to Dismiss (FEF No. 17) and the
government filed a supplemental memorandum concerning the applicability of the IAD (E£F No.
23.) Mr. Gouse claims the writ violated Art. IV (a) of the IAD and violated the anti-shuttling
provisions. (ECF No. 17 at 9.) The government argues a writ of habeas corpus ad
prosequendum is not a detainer, no detainer was lodged on this indictment, and therefore the
IADwas not triggered (EEFNO. 23 at 3.)

II. ANALYSIS
A. The Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act

The IAD is an agreement enabling a state (defined to include the federal government) to
obtain custody of a prisoner held by another state to try the prisoner on criminal charges.
Reed v. Farley. 512 U.S. 339, 341 (1994). Custody is obtained by filing a detainer with the state
where the prisoner is held. United Stales v. Paige, 332 F. Supp. 2d 467, 470 (D.R.l. 2004). A
detainer is a legal order requiring the state with current custody over the prisoner to hold the
prisoner, when he has finished serving his sentence, so that he may be tried by the federal
government or another state for a different crime. Alabama v. Bozeman, 533 U.S. 146. 148
(2001).

"l`he IAD “creates uniform procedures for lodging and executing a detainer." Id. When a
state or the federal government triggers the lAD by filing a detainer against a prisoner in
state, the warden of the prison where the prisoner is serving must promptly notify him or her of
the detainer and the right to request a final disposition under the IAD. 18 U.S.C. App 2 § 2.

Once the prisoner makes the request, he or she is entitled to additional rights under Article lll,

Case 1:11-cr-00112-I\/|-PAS Document 37 Filed 06/18/13 Page 5 of 8 Page|D #: 384

including the right to trial within 180 days after the delivery of the notice. ]d. lf no trial is had
on any indictment, the indictment “shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court
enter an order dismissing the same.” ]d.

Article IV sets forth the anti-shuttling provision, stating a trial must be had “prior to the
prisoner’s being returned to the original place of imprisonment"’ otherwise the charges will be
dismissed Alabama, 533 U.S. at 150 (quotingArt. lV(e)). Section 9 of the IAD specifically allows
for dismissal without prejudice for an indictment from the federal government 18 U.S.C. App 2
§ 2.

"l`he United States is a party to the lAD, so once the federal government lodges a
detainer against a prisoner, they must comply With the lAD’s provisions See United SIc/Ies v.
Mauro, 436 U.S. 340, 361 (1978). After a detainer is lodged, any subsequent writ issued against
the same prisoner is a "written request for temporary custody"’ under the IAD. United Slules v.
Currier, 836 F.2d 11, 14 (_1st Cir. 1987) (citing Mauro, 436 U.S. at 361-64). lt does not matter
whether the government issues a Writ or a piece of paper labeled written request for
temporary custody, as in either case the federal government is able to obtain temporary
custody over the prisoner. Mauro. 436 U.S. at 362.

B. Writ of Habeas Corpus ad prosequendum

A writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum’s function is to secure the presence of the
defendant in federal criminal cases for trial. ld. at 341. A writ requires the defendant’s
presence immediately. Id. Conversely, a detainer only puts the prison officials Where the
defendant is incarcerated on notice the prisoner is wanted Id. Either a prosecutor or law

enforcement officer may lodge a detainer against the defendant. Id.

Case 1:11-cr-00112-I\/|-PAS Document 37 Filed 06/18/13 Page 6 of 8 Page|D #: 385

A writ is not a detainer for purposes of the IAD. Id. at 361. When the federal
government obtains prisoners through a Writ, the problems the IAD seeks to solve do not arise,
and therefore the federal government is not circumventing the LAD through use of the writ. Id.
The IAD only applies to prisoners against whom detainers have been filed. See United Slules v.
Dowdell, 595 F.3d 50, 63 (1st Ci.r. 2010). 'l"he use ofa detainer invokes the IAD, but the use ofa
writ does not. United States v. Cusas, 425 F.3d 23, 67 (1st Cir. 2005).

C. Activation of the IAD

The IAD is only activated by a detainer on the instant charges. Because no detainer was
filed on this particular set of indictments the IAD was not triggered Even if the federal
government did trigger the IAD under the prior set of indictments by lodging a detainer against
Mr. Gouse, the government still complied with the IAD by dismissing the prior indictment
without prejudice, allowed for by section 9. (ECF No. 7 at 9.) A writ requires the prisoner’s
presence immediately, unlike a detainer, which only puts the prison officials on notice the
prisoner is wanted Therefore a writ does not bring up the issues of access to a speedy trial
that the IAD was designed to prevent.

Mr. Gouse contends the federal government’s use of the writ resulted in three
violations of the IADArt. IV (a). (ECF No. 17 at 9.) He asserts the government did not present
the writ as a written request for temporary custody or availability. Id. Mr. Gouse also claims
no thirty day waiting period for the sending state governor to disapprove the request was
allowed for, and neither the Governor of Massachusetts nor Mr. Gouse through the Governor
was given notice of the writ. Id. Lastly, Mr. Gouse claims the federal government violated the
anti-shuttling provisions of both Art. III (d) and Art. IV (e) by shuttling him back to Rhode Island

to face the same charges under the new indictment, Id. at 9-10.

Case 1:11-cr-00112-I\/|-PAS Document 37 Filed 06/18/13 Page 7 of 8 Page|D #: 386

Mr. Gouse argues he should be returned to Massachusetts as the federal government is
attempting to circumvent the requirements of the IAD by re-issuing the same indictment
without the detainer. The Seventh Circuit held in a case similar to Mr. Gouse’s that the LAD
would not apply. “Because the government withdrew its detainer against [the defendant] and
notified him of the withdrawal, the provisions of the Act no longer applied to him.” United
Stales v. Donaldson, 978 F.2d 381, 391 (7th Cir. 1992). The withdrawal of the detainer removes
the defendant from the purview of the MD, as the IAD only prevents detainers from remaining
lodged without any action taken for long periods of time. See Mauro, 436 U.S. at 360.

This case is similar to Donaldson as the government lodged a detainer against Mr.
Gouse but then withdrew it, in this case after the indictment was dismissed without prejudice.
Thus the federal government’s actions here did not frustrate the purpose of the IAD, to allow
for speedy disposition of charges pending against defendants in other jurisdictions Because
Mr. Gouse was aware of the dismissal of the detainer, the IAD’s provisions no longer applied to
him. If the government does not inform the defendant that the charges against him are
dismissed, files an indictment based on the same conduct, and brings the defendant before the
court pursuant to a writ, the government may not benefit from the dismissal of charges. See
United States v. Cephas, 937 F. 2d 816, 820-821 (2d Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1037, 112
(1992). Here, however, Mr. Gouse knew the charges against him were dismissed and knew the
federal government took action to withdraw the detainer.

Mr. Gouse also contends the federal government overstates the holding in United States
v. Mauro. “The United States is bound by the Agreement when it activates its provisions by

filing a detainer against a state prisoner and then obtains his custody by means of a writ of

Case 1:11-cr-00112-I\/|-PAS Document 37 Filed 06/18/13 Page 8 of 8 Page|D #: 387

habeas corpus ad prosequendum,” showing that even though a writ is not a detainer, once a
detainer is lodged, the IAD is implicated Mauro, 436 U.S. at 349.

However, Mauro differs from this case as the detainer was lodged against that defendant
for the charges he was held against, not for dismissed charges as is the case here. In Mr. Gouse’s
case there was no detainer on the instant charges. The First Circuit recently held “Mauro was
saying that a habeas writ - even though it followed a detainer - retained its pre-IAD authority to
compel a state to surrender a prisoner.” United States v. P/eau` 680 F.3d 1. 6 (1st Cir. 2012)
cerl. denied 133 S. Ct. 930 (U.S. 2013). The habeas Statute overrides any contrary position of
the state, like any other federal law. ]d. Therefore a federal governments writ retains its
authority over a prisoner and in this case the IAD is not activated

III. CONCLUSION

This Court finds that the IAD was not violated as the federal government did not lodge a
detainer against Mr. Gouse in the present indictment Therefore, for all of the foregoing reasons,

Mr. Gouse’s Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 17) is DENIED.
