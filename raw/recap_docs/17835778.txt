                        ORDER AFFIRMING THE
             RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE


       The United States Magistrate Judge filed with the Court on August 28, 2013, her

Recommended Decision (ECF No. 162). Movant filed his Objection to the Recommended Decision

ECF No. 164) on September 16, 2013.

       I have reviewed and considered the Magistrate Judge's Recommended Decision, together

with the entire record; I have made a de novo determination of all matters adjudicated by the

Magistrate Judge's Recommended Decision; and I concur with the recommendations of the United

States Magistrate Judge for the reasons set forth in her Recommended Decision, and determine that

no further proceeding is necessary.

       1.      It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the Magistrate Judge
               is hereby AFFIRMED.

       2.      It is hereby ORDERED that Movant’s Motion to Re-open his Habeas Petition under
               28 U.S.C. §2255 is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE to Movant’s right to file a
               new 28 U.S.C. §2255 motion should Movant ever obtain the First Circuit Court of
               Appeal’s certification to do so.

       3.     It is hereby ORDERED that a certificate of appealability shall not issue in the event
              that Movant files a notice of appeal because there is no substantial showing of the
              denial of a constitutional right within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. §2253(c).
