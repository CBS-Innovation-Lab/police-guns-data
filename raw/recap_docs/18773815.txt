United States of America

Kenneth P. Beard



                                        ORDER



       Defendant's assented-to motion to continue the trial (document no. 16) is granted.

Trial has been rescheduled for the July 2006 trial period. Defendant shall file a Waiver of

the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ยง

3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would unreasonably deny the

defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective preparation taking into account the
