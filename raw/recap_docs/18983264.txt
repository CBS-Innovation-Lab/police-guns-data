                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                        DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                                   Criminal No. 09-cr-93-02-JL

Annmarie Clement

                                  O R D E R

     Defendant appeared for a bail revocation hearing pursuant to

18 U.S.C. ยง 3148.

     Since being afforded bail defendant has violated her bail as

evidenced by drug tests on January 10, 2010, June 6, 2011, June

13, 2011, July 11, 2011 (admitted oxycodone use on use on July 6

and 10, 2011), July 12 and 13, 2011, August 1, 2011 and August 8

and 10 (morphine).       She has 40 unaccounted for prescription

oxycodone.     Her parental custody has not been effective. Given

the number of failed opportunities to comply with conditions I

find that the defendant is unlikely to abide by any condition or

combination of conditions.        The conditions of release are

revoked.

     Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the defendant be detained

pending trial.

     The defendant is committed to the custody of the Attorney

General or his designated representative for confinement in a

corrections facility separate, to the extent practicable, from

persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody

pending appeal.     The defendant shall be afforded a reasonable

opportunity for private consultation with defense counsel.             On

order of a court of the United States or on request of an

attorney for the government, the person in charge of the

corrections facility shall deliver the defendant to the United

States Marshal for the purpose of an appearance in connection

with a court proceeding.

      SO ORDERED.
