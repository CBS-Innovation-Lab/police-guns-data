                         MEMORANDUM & ORDER

GORTON, J.

I.   Background

     On August 14, 2008 defendant Carlos Landan (“Landan”) was

charged in an eight count Superceding Indictment.         On December

14, 2010, defendant pled guilty to seven counts pursuant to a

plea agreement with the government.       Under the plea agreement

defendant pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine

and felon in possession charges.      In exchange, the government

agreed to drop Count Eight of the Superseding Indictment which

charged the defendant with possession of a firearm in furtherance

of drug trafficking.    That charge would have carried a mandatory

minimum five-year sentence on and after any other sentence

imposed.

     In the plea agreement LanDan took responsibility for between

50 and 150 grams of crack cocaine.       He also “waive[d] any right

he has to challenge his sentence on direct appeal or in

                                   -1-

collateral challenge.”

      On August 3, 2010, Congress enacted the Fair Sentencing Act

of 2010 (“FSA”) which increased the amount of crack cocaine

required to trigger the mandatory minimum sentences.          On May 17,

2011 LanDan was sentenced under the premise that the then

mandatory minimum of 120 months was applicable.         The Court

departed above the guideline range based on the government’s

motion for departure and sentenced LanDan to 133 months.

      On April 6, 2012, LanDan filed a motion requesting

retroactive application of the sentencing guidelines pursuant to

§ 18 U.S.C. 3582 (c)(2).     LanDan relied on the Supreme Court’s

decision in Dorsey v. United States, 132 S.Ct. 2321 (2012) which

held that the FSA penalty scheme applies to all defendants

sentenced on or after August 3, 2010, regardless of when they

committed the offense.     Although LanDan was sentenced after that

date, this Court determined that because LanDan’s sentence was

based on a mandatory minimum and an upward variance pursuant to

28 U.S.C. § 3553 and not on the guidelines he is ineligible for

relief under § 3582.    As a result, the Court treated defendant’s

motion as a motion for re-sentencing and requested that the

parties submit briefs.

II.   Analysis

      The Court agrees that because LanDan was sentenced after

August 3, 2010, under the reasoning of Dorsey he would no longer


                                   -2-

be subject to the ten-year mandatory minimum.       That analysis is

changed, however, by the fact that in this case defendant agreed

in writing as part of his plea deal to waive his right to appeal.

     The First Circuit has not ruled as to whether to enforce

appeal waivers in cases raising FSA claims post Dorsey.          It

appears, however, that every federal court that has addressed

that issue has enforced the appeal waiver.       See, e.g., United

States v. Harrison, No. 11-cr-1240, slip op. at 2-3 (2d Cir. Nov.

6, 2012) (per curiam); United States v. Stephens, 2012 WL

4874857, at *2-3 (3d Cir. Oct. 16, 2012); United States v.

Thomas, 2012 WL 4378736, at *1 (5th Cir. Sept. 26, 2012); United

States v. Webb-Thompson, 2012 WL 3683522, at *1-2 (E.D.N.Y. Aug.

24, 2012)(“[t]he Supreme Court's holding in Dorsey, establishing

that the FSA is applicable to defendants like Webb–Thompson, does

not render the [appeal] waiver unenforceable”).        In so ruling,

the Second Circuit even noted that the fact that most of the

applicable decisions were unpublished or made in summary orders

“underscores the fact that the applicable law is altogether

clear.”   Harrison, No. 11-cr-1240, slip op. at 3.

     Enforcing the appeal waiver is also consistent with the

position this Court took at sentencing in this case. After noting

that the parties disputed whether the FSA should be applied

retroactively, the Court commented that such an

     argument would apply if there wasn’t any plea agreement
     in this case . . . But in this case, it seems to me there

                                     -3-

     is a written plea agreement...[in which defendant] agreed
     that the ten-year mandatory minimum applied.

This court stands by its original statement.       Furthermore,

because the waiver was knowingly and voluntarily agreed to

despite defendant’s awareness of the dispute regarding the

retroactivity of the FSA, this Court declines to overturn

defendant’s appeal waiver.    The parties are both entitled to the

benefit of their (plea) bargain.     The defendant will not be seen

to disavow that bargain after the fact.      As a result, defendant’s

sentence will not be reduced.

                                 ORDER

     In accordance with the foregoing, defendants’ motion to reduce

sentence (Docket No. 156) is DENIED.



So ordered.
