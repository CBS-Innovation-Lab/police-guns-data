                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America
     v.                                   Case No. 12-cr-33-PB

Sharon Cote



                                  O R D E R



     The defendant has moved through counsel to continue the

November 6, 2012 trial in the above case, citing the need for

additional time to review new discovery and consider plea

negotiations or prepare for trial.          The government does not

object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Although the court indicated no further continuances, for

the reasons cited above and to allow the parties additional time

to properly prepare for trial, the court will continue the trial

from November 6, 2012 to January 8, 2013.           In agreeing to

continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ยง

3161(h)(7)(A) that the ends of justice served in granting a

continuance outweigh the best interests of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial.
