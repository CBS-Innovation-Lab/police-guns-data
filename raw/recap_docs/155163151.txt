                             UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                              DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS

     UNITED STATES OF AMERICA                        )

                           v.                        )    1:19-cr-10196-MLW

     PAUL VOTANO                                     )
                                                     )


                                       JOINT STATUS REPORT


        Now come the parties jointly pursuant to the Court’s November 18, 2020 order to report

further as to the status of the case. Dkt. 42. Counsel has been able to confer with Mr. Votano by

phone since the last status report, and the parties are now actively pursuing a plea agreement. In

addition, Mr. Votano and his state counsel have reported an agreement with the Commonwealth

for a jointly recommended sentence in a pending state case.

        Due to the upcoming holidays, the parties may not be able to finalize a plea agreement

for several weeks. Consequently, the parties request a date in February 2021 in order to file a

further status report. Should the parties be prepared to proceed with a Rule 11 hearing before

such date, defense counsel will file a Motion for Rule 11 Hearing. The parties also request that

the Court exclude the time until the next event from Speedy Trial Act calculations for the above

reasons in the interests of justice.
