NO. 06-1660
UNITED STATES,
Appellee,
v.
KEVIN APONTE,

Defendant, Appellant.

 

Before

Torruella, Lynch and Lipez,
Circuit Judges.

 

JUDGMENT
Entered: November l, 2006

We agree with the government that there is no substantial
issue on appeal. The district court properly calculated and
considered the advisory guidelines. §§§ United States v. Jimenez-
Beltre, 440 F.Bd 514, 518 (lEt Cir. 2006)(en banc)(consideration of
guidelines appropriate first step in sentence determination). Its
consideration of the sentencing factors set out in 18 U.S.C. § 3553
is clear from the transcript of the sentencing hearing, although
not all factors were referred to explicitly. The court‘s
explanation of its sentence, which focused on appellant's contempt
for the law and his "horrifying" history of violent offenses,
embodies concern for respect for the law, deterrence, the
characteristics and history of the defendant, and the protection of
the public. See United States v. Navedo~Concepcion, 450 F.Bd 54, 57
(l5b Cir. 2006)(where reasons for the sentence are obviousr less
explanation is needed). The court addressed the parsimony
principle directly, noting that any shorter sentence would have
been inadequate. We discern no error or abuse of discretion.
