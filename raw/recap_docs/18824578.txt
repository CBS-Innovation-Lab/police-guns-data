                 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                       DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

           v.                            Criminal No. 05-cr-241-04-JD

Sothear Kim


                                 O R D E R


      The assented to motion to reschedule jury trial (document no.

201) filed by defendant is granted.        Trial is also continued as to

co-defendant Virak Tin unless an objection is filed on or before

June 18, 2007.

      Defendant shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights within 10

days.   The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting

a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3131(h)(8)(B)(iv), for the

reasons set forth in the motion.

      SO ORDERED.



                                         /s/ Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr.
