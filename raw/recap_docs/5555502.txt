           ASSENTED-TO MOTION TO CONTINUE STATUS CONFERENCE

       The government hereby requests a continuance of the status

conference, currently scheduled for April 23, 2008.                As grounds,

the government states that the Court previously granted a

continuance to April 23, 2008.          AUSA Connolly will be on vacation

from April 10 to April 25, 2008, and will be unavailable on April

23.    As stated in its previous motion to continue, the parties

have been negotiating a universal plea agreement.                 The proposed

universal plea agreement, which would resolve the case against

all defendants in the case, is being considered by the U.S.

Attorney’s Office.

       Accordingly, the government, with the assent of all

defendants, requests a continuance of the status conference to a

date on or after May 19, 2008.

       In addition, the parties agree to exclude the time from

April 23, 2008, to the date set for a further status conference,

and ask that this Court find, based on the above, that the ends

of justice served by granting the requested exclusions outweigh

the best interest of the public and the defendants in a speedy

trial, and, accordingly, exclude the above period in computing

the time within which trial must commence under 18 U.S.C. §3161.
