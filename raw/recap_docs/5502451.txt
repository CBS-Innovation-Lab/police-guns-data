              MOTION FOR A PRE-PLEA PRESENTENCE REPORT

       Now comes the defendant, and moves this Honorable Court to order the Probation

Department to prepare a pre-plea Presentence Report in the above captioned matter. In

support of this Motion, the defendant states that preparation of the report at this time will

allow him to be apprised of the potential sentence he faces should he enter a guilty plea to

the pending charge, to wit, a violation of 18 U.S.C. §922(G)(1). It would be sufficient for

the Court to order an abbreviated version of a Presentence Report be prepared, one

setting forth only the offense conduct, Mr. Robateau’s criminal history, and the

sentencing options; such an abbreviated report would inform Mr. Robateau of the likely

advisory sentencing guideline range, and, more importantly, whether any minimum

mandatory sentence is applicable.

   For the foregoing reasons, the defendant prays the Court allow this Motion.


                                        Respectfully Submitted,
