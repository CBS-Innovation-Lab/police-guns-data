             1                            P R O C E E D I N G S

             2                (The following proceedings were held in Judge

             3     Lasker's chambers:)

             4                THE COURT:        I received, as I guess everybody

             5     knows -- except I didn't know it myself until this

             6     morning -- a motion from the defendant for release

             7     pending appeal based on the question of whether a

             8     conversation with an individual named Kevin Brown should

             9     have been admitted or not --

            10                Am I correct?

            11                MR. KERNER:        Yes.

            12                THE COURT:        -- as part of the evidence which

            13     would, if admitted, allegedly have been favorable to the

            14     defendant.

            15                You haven't had an opportunity to answer this

            16     yet, have you?

            17                I'm addressing the United States Attorney.

            18                MR. BATOR:        No, your Honor.        I've only -- I

            19     think I saw it for the first time yesterday.

            20                THE COURT:        I saw it for the first time this

            21     morning, which is very troublesome.

            22                MR. KERNER:        I would not necessarily be seeking

            23     a hearing on that motion today.               I just wanted it to be

            24     filed, and then at an appropriate time in the future,

            25     after the government has a chance to respond, have a

             1     hearing.

             2                THE COURT:        All right.       In other words, we'll

             3     proceed with sentencing today?

             4                MR. KERNER:        Yes.

             5                THE COURT:        But you would ask to preserve the

             6     right to have me review the situation of whether he

             7     should be released from custody pending appeal after the

             8     government has answered the motion?

             9                MR. KERNER:        Yes.     Yes.

            10                MR. BATOR:        Preliminarily, I guess it troubles

            11     me, is the right word, too, to receive these motions so

            12     close to the event.           My first reaction, your Honor, is

            13     that the motion should be stricken because it's based

            14     entirely on, essentially, assertions --

            15                THE COURT:        Yeah.     Well --

            16                MR. BATOR:        -- of counsel.

            17                THE COURT:        -- I don't need you to answer at the

            18     moment.

            19                MR. BATOR:        But one relevant consideration is

            20     that I also received at the same time notice of appeal.

            21     And I think this -- which is -- I just saw Mr. Kerner

            22     this morning, and I haven't had a chance --

            23                THE COURT:        I think a notice of appeal is

            24     premature.

            25                MR. BATOR:        I think it's premature, too,

             1     although I assume after the Court imposes sentence,

             2     assuming we go forward today, I anticipate he'll file a

             3     motion for appeal.           But at that point isn't the Court

             4     absent jurisdiction with regard to all these matters?                   I

             5     think one of the issues with regard to this motion is

             6     that it's -- it may be properly the subject matter of an

             7     appellate argument.

             8                THE COURT:        Well, I'm not asking you to take a

             9     position on those questions at the moment.                    I'm

            10     satisfied defense counsel states to me that he does not

            11     intend to ask for relief with regard to this motion

            12     today.

            13                MR. KERNER:        No; I just wanted it filed.

            14                THE COURT:        I'm ready to proceed to sentencing.

            15                MR. KERNER:        Thank you.

            17     recess in the proceedings at 11:18 a.m.)

            18                (In open court:)

            19                THE CLERK:        All rise.

             4     and who they represent, for the Court.

             5                MR. BATOR:        Good afternoon, your Honor.

             6     Christopher Bator for the United States.

             7                THE COURT:        Good afternoon, Mr. Bator.

             8                MR. KERNER:        Tom Kerner for Mr. Weeks, your

             9     Honor.

            10                THE COURT:        Good morning, Mr. Kerner.

            11                Before I call on Mr. Kerner, who represents Mr.

            12     Weeks, and before I call on Mr. Weeks, I'll give the

            13     government an opportunity to express any views they have

            14     with regard to the sentencing, if you wish to do so.

            15                MR. BATOR:        I do, your Honor.         Would the

            16     government like to hear what the government's -- would

            17     the Court like to hear what the government's

            18     recommendation and what the basis for it is at this time

            19     or did you want to go through the guideline provisions

            20     first?

            21                THE COURT:        I'm sorry?

            22                MR. BATOR:        Would the Court like to hear from

            23     the government with regard to its recommendation and

            24     basis for it at this time or did the Court --

            25                THE COURT:        Yes, I would.

             1                MR. BATOR:        Okay.     Does the Court intend, if I

             2     may ask, to go through the guidelines issues

             3     subsequently?

             4                THE COURT:        I'm satisfied with the guidelines,

             5     if correctly applied in this case, if you'd like to know

             6     that.     But I would like to hear what the government's

             7     view is.

             8                MR. BATOR:        Again, forgive me for -- because

             9     there are some objections, your Honor.                  I believe just

            10     as a matter of record we'll have to --

            11                THE COURT:        State your position.

            12                MR. BATOR:        On behalf of the government?             I'm

            13     happy to, your Honor.

            14                The government's recommendation is for guideline

            15     sentence, a sentence at the low end of the guideline,

            16     which the applicable guideline the government believes

            17     is 235 months to 293 months.                The government seeks a

            18     sentence at the low end of that guideline, a 235-month

            19     sentence of incarceration, five years of supervised

            20     release, the $100 mandatory special assessment.

            21                With regard to the fine, the government is in a

            22     bit of a quandary because the presentence report

             1     the presentence report has indicated, there's no

             2     indication of inability to pay a fine.

             3                The government believes it's seeking a very

             4     significant sentence here and does not wish to be

             5     heavy-handed, but in the absence of that information is

             6     a little bit at a loss of what to request and believes

             7     that some -- absent that information, which a defendant

             8     is required to provide to the probation office,

             9     particularly to indicate if there's an inability to pay

            10     a fine -- that absent the provision of that information

            11     some fine, given the seriousness of the charges here and

            12     the complete record of the defendant, would be

            13     appropriate.

            14                But the government would defer to the Court with

            15     regard to what is appropriate, but its position is:

            16     Absent that information, some fine would be appropriate.

            17                THE COURT:        I hear you.

            18                MR. BATOR:        With regard to the basis for the

            19     government's recommendation, the government recognizes

            20     that it is asking for a very significant sentence here.

            21     And particularly in view of the 15-year minimum

            22     mandatory and the guideline range -- armed career

            23     criminal guideline range here -- is somewhat above the

            24     15-year minimum mandatory.

            25                The guideline range is approximately 19 and a

             1     half years to approximately 24 and a half years.                      And

             2     the government is asking for the 235 months, the low end

             3     of that guideline.

             4                The government feels very strongly that a

             5     guideline sentence is appropriate in this case.

             6     Entirely appropriate.            And the reason for that is what

             7     is an established, extensive record of criminal behavior

             8     involving significant violence and drug trafficking of

             9     the defendant over a very long time.

            10                The one thing that I should say honestly, your

            11     Honor, that troubles the government to some extent is

            12     that throughout the tone of the defendant's filings, the

            13     defendant's own letter, there's a suggestion that, as

            14     the defendant says in his letter, I'm not the bad guy,

            15     the prosecutor -- he says the ADA -- the prosecutor

            16     makes me out to be.

            17                And the suggestion is the record isn't very

            18     significant, it's minimal; if he qualifies as an armed

            19     career criminal, it's only just barely.                   And that is

            20     absolutely not the case.             The defendant has, depending

            21     on how you count, four or five armed career criminal

            22     predicates.       He's not barely qualifying, he's adequately

            23     qualifying.       He has a criminal history score of -- the

            24     PSR indicates it's 19 points.               I spoke with Mr. Gomes

            25     having noticed -- this morning, having noticing

             1     something last night.            I think the accurate number is 21

             2     points because he gets two additional points for

             3     having -- under Sentencing Guideline 4A.1.1(d) for

             4     having committed the instant crime while under

             5     supervision of another sentence.                And I'd refer the

             6     Court to Paragraph 4 of the conviction, Paragraph 48.

             7     If that's true, and I believe Mr. Gomes concurs with

             8     that, for purposes of his arguments, he would have 21

             9     points.

            10                There's a First Circuit case, Brown, your Honor,

            11     United States v. Brown, 899 F.2d 94, which holds that a

            12     significant -- a criminal history score significantly

            13     above the 13 points which qualifies you for Category VI

            14     is, itself, a basis for an upward departure.                     Brown is

            15     the case where the criminal -- the defendant had 20

            16     points.      And in the language in Brown the Court -- the

            17     First Circuit says that is off the charts and qualifies

            18     as an appropriate basis for an upward departure from the

            19     guideline.

            20                The government isn't seeking an upward departure

            21     from the guideline; the government is seeking a low-end

            22     guideline sentence.           But I think that's more evidence

            23     that his record is very significant.                  And I'd like to

            24     spend a second detailing it because I think the record

            25     should appropriately reflect that, and I want to make

             1     sure I can draw the Court's attention to it.

             2                Beginning at age 16 through the present there

             3     are just continual, repeated convictions for assault and

             4     battery, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon,

             5     resisting arrest, distributing cocaine.                   The record is

             6     persistent --

             7                THE COURT:        It's considerable.

             9                And it is entirely consistent with the crime of

            10     conviction in this case, and it is, it seems to me,

            11     entirely consistent with the behavior of the defendant

            12     when he did not show up for sentencing having been

            13     given, in the government's view, a considerable break to

            14     be allowed to be out pending sentencing, facing such a

            15     large sentence, that he absconded and --

            21     9-millimeter weapons -- and five false identity papers

             1     tools of an armed career criminal, your Honor.                         And I

             2     believe that is the picture that his record

             3     appropriately presents.

             4                I think the other thing I'd point on briefly is

             5     I do believe that the defendant perjured himself during

             6     his trial.       I think that was the jury's determination.

             7     The case essentially came down to a credibility contest

             8     between the defendant and the police officers; in

             9     particular, Officer Darrah.

            10                And I think the defendant came in here and

            11     told -- and lied to the Court and lied to the jury with

            12     regard to this -- what the government believes was this

            13     fairytale about the other car -- the Court will remember

            14     from the trial -- with the man in the Red Sox shirt who

            15     there had been an interaction -- previous interaction

            16     with in the bar, driving not down this alleyway toward

            17     the -- purportedly toward the defendant, Mr. Brown,

            18     firing a gun and then either dropping or leaving a

            19     loaded gun for the defendant to -- Mr. Brown to find.

            20     And the defendant says that happened and of course he

            21     didn't pick up the gun, Mr. Brown did, and he was

            22     unaware of this.

            23                The notion that they would be running -- it's

            24     undisputed the defendants were running in the direction

            25     of this car -- them running in the direction of someone

             1     who was firing shots at them is, among other things,

             2     part of what the government believed was a fairytale and

             3     was bald-face lies in front of the Court and in front of

             4     the jury, for which the government believes the

             5     defendant deserves a two-point obstruction enhancement.

             6     The enhancement already applies, as the PSR indicates,

             7     as a result of the absconding at the time of sentencing.

             8     But I think that is consistent with this picture of the

             9     defendant.

            10                I intended to go on longer but I think the Court

            11     understands the government's position.

            12                THE COURT:        I think you've adequately covered

            13     it.

            16                Mr. Kerner?

            17                MR. KERNER:        Thank you, your Honor.

            18                Your Honor, I filed a sentencing memorandum, and

            19     in that memorandum I indicated that I believed that the

            20     criminal history category was overstated by the

            21     probation department, and that for the reasons stated in

            22     my memorandum that he is -- he should be assessed 17

            23     criminal history points, which still puts him into

            24     Category VI.

            25                I further stated that I believe that if you look

             1     at the nature of his prior convictions, they were all

             2     convictions which resulted in either a probationary

             3     sentence or a relatively short time in a county house of

             4     correction.

             5                My argument was that a Level VI is the worst

             6     category that you can be put into under the guidelines,

             7     and I suggested that even though Mr. Weeks does have a

             8     fairly substantial prior criminal history, that it is

             9     far from being the worst that comes through these

            10     courthouse doors.

            11                The main argument, your Honor, is really whether

            12     or not the assault and battery in Somerville, and

            13     possibly the resisting arrest in Brockton, are violent

            14     felonies for purposes of the ACC.                 And they aren't for

            15     two reasons:        One, they are state misdemeanors,

            16     punishable by two years or less, so they are excluded

            17     under the statute; and, two, they are -- there is

            18     nothing in the -- there's nothing before the Court

            19     admissible under Shepard which would indicate that

            20     either resisting arrest or the assault and battery were

            21     violent felonies; they were just generic assault and

            22     battery, generic resisting arrest.

            23                And there are two ways in which both of those

            24     crimes can be committed; both of those crimes can be

            25     committed without violence.                 And there's nothing to

             1     indicate -- there's nothing before this Court that is

             2     admissible under Shepard to show that it was committed

             3     in a way that was violent.

             4                The police reports are not admissible; there are

             5     no plea colloquies; there is -- I've been provided with

             6     no charging documents which indicate that there was

             7     violence associated with either one of these crimes.                   So

             8     you cannot consider them violent felonies, I would

             9     suggest, based on Shepard, and pursuant to the statute

            10     they are not violent felonies and they cannot be ACC

            11     predicates.       Even if there is something in there which

            12     indicates there was some threat of force or force used,

            13     they are still state misdemeanors punishable by two

            14     years or less; and, thus, they are excluded from the ACC

            15     pursuant to the statute.

            16                My argument, your Honor, is that you should

            17     consider the guidelines at Offense Level 24, and

            18     criminal -- the guideline should be criminal Category

            19     VI, Offense Level 24.            And my suggestion is that given

            20     that even though there are sufficient points to place

            21     Mr. Weeks into Category VI, because of the nature of

            22     most of those convictions -- I would suggest that only

            23     the two drug charges are felonies -- that it would be

            24     appropriate to depart from the guidelines by one

            25     criminal history category to Criminal History Category

             1     V, and that would put him into a situation where the

             2     guideline range is 92 to 115 months.

             3                Now, Judge, this was a conviction which Mr.

             4     Weeks is appealing.           This is a conviction that was

             5     returned by a jury -- an all-white jury that was chosen

             6     under a system that has now been revamped by this court.

             7     It was objected to at the time of the impaneling; I

             8     objected to the fact that the whole panel consisted of

             9     no African-Americans and I asked for a new panel, and

            10     that was denied.

            11                Since that time this court, the district court,

            12     has revamped its procedures for calling people for jury

            13     duty to get a more representative racial mix of the jury

            14     panels.

            15                THE COURT:        Right.

            16                MR. KERNER:        And so if it was not a fair -- he

            17     was not convicted under a fair jury-picking system

            18     because if it was fair, they would have kept it that

            19     way.    It wasn't fair then -- and it may be fair now, but

            20     it wasn't fair then.            And we objected to that.               And he

            21     was convicted by an all-white jury and he was convicted

            22     by lying white police officers.

            23                And we know that they were lying because we have

            24     a transcript of one police officer from a motion to

            25     suppress hearing before you where he sat right over

             1     there, and the police officer, whose name is Healy, said

             2     that Darrah, the main police officer, told Healy on the

             3     night of the incident that Mr. Weeks jumped over the

             4     short six-foot fence with the barbed wire.                    And then he

             5     came into court and he lied.                He lied to the jury, he

             6     lied to you, he lied to everybody, and he said that

             7     Darrah told him that he jumped over the eight-foot fence

             8     into that little pen area where the gun and the phone

             9     were found.

            10                And he said that after he was spoken to by the

            11     U.S. Attorney's Office.             And his excuse was, "Oh, I was

            12     confused."       He was not confused because -- I have the

            13     transcript right here.

            14                THE COURT:        We're not retrying the case.

            15                MR. KERNER:        I'm not retrying the case but I'm

            16     pointing out to you that this was an issue that you have

            17     to take into consideration.

            18                THE COURT:        Not with regard to sentencing.                If

            19     the defendant is not guilty, that's one thing; but if

            20     he's guilty, then I have to decide what's an appropriate

            21     sentence.       And that doesn't depend on the issues that

            22     you're now talking about.              The other ones, it does.

            23                MR. KERNER:        Yes.     Well, the government claims

            24     that it's their opinion that Mr. Weeks lied during the

            25     trial.     Well, that's the government's opinion.                      We have

             1     proof that the government lied.

             2                THE COURT:        I don't -- come on.          Calm down.    I

             3     don't accept the government's, quote, opinion either.

             4                MR. KERNER:        Thank you, your Honor.            I'll move

             5     on.    I appreciate that.

             6                If this case were properly brought in the

             7     Brockton District Court where it belonged, he would be

             8     facing a one-year minimum mandatory for possession of a

             9     gun -- if he was convicted -- possession of a gun

            10     without a license.           That's what the punishment is in the

            11     state court.

            12                THE COURT:        Well, your complaint there is with

            13     the executive or the Congress, not with me.

            14                MR. KERNER:        Yes.     And this is my argument for a

            15     departure, all right?

            16                THE COURT:        It's not a recognized argument for

            17     departure.

            18                MR. KERNER:        It could be.

            19                THE COURT:        The fact that a penalty would be

            20     less in the state system is not a recognized argument

            21     for departure.         And I'm a great departer, I'll tell you.

            22                MR. KERNER:        But if you take into consideration

            23     the circumstances under which this case got here it may

            24     be.    Because what happened that night is Mr. Weeks and

            25     Mr. Kelvin Brown were both charged with possessing that

             2                Mr. Kelvin Brown's case -- it wasn't a situation

             3     where the police didn't know what happened and then a

             4     couple of hours later, or a couple of days later, even

             5     weeks later, hashed things out, dismissed Kelvin Brown

             6     and prosecuted Mr. Weeks.              What happened is that they

             7     figured out that they could get 15 years from Mr. Weeks

             8     and not from Mr. Brown, and that's why the case was

             9     brought here.

            10                MR. BATOR:        I'm going to object, your Honor.

            11                THE COURT:        It would be a perfectly good reason

            12     for bringing it here.            I have nothing to do with that,

            13     and you know that.

            14                MR. KERNER:        I know that you have nothing to do

            15     with it.

            16                THE COURT:        It is nothing that is appropriate

            17     for me to consider.

            18                MR. KERNER:        Thank you, your Honor.

            19                THE COURT:        Would you please get to your

            20     recommendation?

            21                MR. KERNER:        My recommendation is that since

            22     this is a situation where if the case was brought in

            23     state court, he was facing here, I'm asking for a

            24     three-year sentence; I'm asking for 36 months, which is

            25     a considerable sentence.

             1                THE COURT:        It's perfectly justifiable for you

             2     to ask for anything you want to, but you know very well

             3     that that's not going to fly with the Court of Appeals.

             4                MR. KERNER:        Then at the very least, your Honor,

             5     I believe that you should determine that Mr. Weeks is

             6     not an ACC, he does not qualify for the ACC, and that

             7     his guidelines should be 24/VI, and that you would be --

             8     it would be appropriate for you to depart one level on

             9     the criminal history category, from VI to V.                     And under

            10     24/V, the guidelines are 92 to 115 months.                    And I would

            11     ask that you -- then if you are not going to depart

            12     further, then 92 months.

            13                THE COURT:        Thank you very much.

            14                MR. KERNER:        Thank you.

            15                MR. BATOR:        Your Honor, may I be heard just for

            16     the record?

            17                THE COURT:        No.    Nothing further.         I've heard

            18     enough.      I'm ready to proceed.            Please be seated.

            19                MR. BATOR:        Your Honor, for the record above, I

            20     need to responds to his ACC arguments if only to say the

            21     government has previously filed a memorandum and that

            22     its position with regard to his argument whether what

            23     qualifies as an ACC predicate or not, and that

            24     memorandum indicates it's been rejected by the First

            25     Circuit.

             1                I need to say that for the record for above,

             2     your Honor, or we'll be back here.

             3                THE COURT:        I understand.

             4                Mr. Weeks, do you want to stand?

             5                (Defendant rises.)

             6                THE COURT:        Mr. Weeks, here we are all gathered

             7     together because of your case.                 It's a pretty heavy

             8     moment for you, it's a pretty heavy moment for me, too.

             9     You can tell me anything you want before I go ahead and

            10     impose a sentence.           I have to impose a significant

            11     sentence here, and you know it.                 And I'd like to hear

            12     what you have to say before I do it.

            13                THE DEFENDANT:          All right.      First I want to say

            14     I'm sorry for not showing up for sentencing.                     The reason

            15     why I didn't show up was because my father was sick and

            16     I had to take care of my little sisters.                    And I was

            17     having a little baby girl.

            18                I'm 27 years old with two beautiful little girls

            19     that I want to see grow up.                 I'm older now and I know

            20     right from wrong.          I know if I had another chance, I

            21     would stay out of trouble and do the right thing.

            22                While I was on release I never did any drugs or

            23     drink, I took things serious because I wanted to stay

            24     out.    The longest time I ever did in jail was 10 months;

            25     I never did any longer time than that.

             1                I'm asking the Court for mercy, to justify [sic]

             2     a lenient sentence.           Thank you.

             3                THE COURT:        Well, Mr. Weeks, I'm going to have

             4     to go through a little arithmetic, for the record, to

             5     explain why I'm imposing the sentence that I am imposing

             6     and so on.       There's been argument between counsel as to

             7     how you calculate all this stuff.                 But let me just say

             8     that I adopt the calculations made in the presentence

             9     report by the probation department here, and find that

            10     there is a base offense level of 24, with 2 added as an

            11     adjustment for obstruction of justice and failure to

            12     appear for sentencing, an adjusted offense level of 26.

            13                And I conclude with regret, but nevertheless

            14     firmly, that the defendant is subject to the armed

            15     career criminal provision described at 18 U.S.C. Section

            16     924(e) and the guidelines accordingly; second, I

            17     conclude that you have three prior convictions for a

            18     violent felony or a serious drug offense or both,

            19     committed on occasions different from one another; and

            20     that the total offense level is then 33.

            21                Against you, to get back to plain English now,

            22     is the nature of what you did:                Possessing a firearm

            23     after having been convicted of a felony; together with a

            24     considerable prior record commencing when you were only

            25     16 including assault and battery; attempted larceny on a

                                                                                             23



             1     person resulting in a jail sentence; assault and battery

             2     at age 18 for which a sentence was imposed; a further

             3     assault; knowingly receiving stolen property for which

             4     you received a jail sentence in 1998; sale of cocaine at

             5     the age of 19 where you were sentenced; possession of

             6     cocaine, the one-year committed deemed served; and

             7     battery and resisting arrest in Miami, Florida, in 2002.

             8                Now, according to the calculations of the

             9     probation department, which I believe to be correct, in

            10     this case the guideline range is 235 to 293 months.                    The

            11     statutory minimum is 15 years to life.                   This is one of

            12     those rare cases in which the guideline minimum is well

            13     above the statutory minimum and in which both such

            14     sentences are substantial and long.

            15                I conclude that to impose a sentence of not less

            16     than 235 months, which is the guideline minimum, would

            17     be excessive within the meaning of 18 United States Code

            18     3553(a).      Accordingly, I impose the following sentence:

            19     Pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, and

            20     having considered the sentencing statute enumerated at

            21     18 U.S.C. Section 3553(a), it's the judgment of the

            22     Court that the defendant, Jerome Weeks, is hereby

            23     committed to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons, to be

            24     imprisoned for a term of 180 months, which is the

            25     statutory minimum.

             1                The Court makes the judicial recommendation that

             2     the defendant participate in anger management or

             3     batterer's counseling, if available, at the designated

             4     Bureau of Prisons' facility.

             5                Upon release from imprisonment, the defendant

             6     shall be placed on supervised release for a term of

             7     three years.        Within 72 hours of release from custody of

             8     the Bureau of Prisons, you shall report in person to the

             9     district in which you were released.

            10                No fine is imposed based on the Court's finding

            11     that there is no evidence of your ability to pay a fine

            12     or that you are likely to become able to do so.

            13                While on supervised release you shall comply

            14     with the following conditions:                You shall not commit

            15     another offense; you shall refrain from any unlawful use

            16     of a controlled substance and submit to one drug test

            17     within 15 days of release from imprisonment, at least

            18     two periodic tests thereafter, not to exceed 104 tests

            19     per year; you shall submit to the collection of a DNA

            20     sample; you shall comply with the standard conditions as

            21     has been adopted by the Court which are described in the

            22     guidelines, Section 5D1.3(c); and you're prohibited from

            23     possessing a firearm or other dangerous weapon.

            24                It is further and finally determined that you

            25     shall pay to the United States a special assessment of

                                                                                                25



             1     $100, which shall be due.

             2                Now, Mr. Weeks, I've gone down as far as it's

             3     possible for me to go, and it's still a very tough

             4     sentence, I realize.            I don't write the laws; I'm

             5     obligated to impose a sentence as the laws are imposed

             6     on me.     You will get time off each year for good

             7     behavior, if you behave well, and that will reduce the

             8     sentence by a number of years, although it's still going

             9     to be long.

            10                You will still, however, not be an old man when

            11     you come out, and I hope and believe and wish that

            12     things will turn around for you and for society and for

            13     your friends and family who are here today, all of whose

            14     letters I received and read and care about.                     But they

            15     must know that I'm not just free to do anything I wish.

            16                I want to tell you that you have the right to

            17     appeal both your conviction and your sentence.                         You have

            18     significant reasons to appeal your conviction because

            19     you have a question of suppression of evidence and other

            20     issues raised by your attorney.

            21                I assume that counsel will arrange to file a

            22     notice of appeal forthwith.                 Am I correct in that

            23     regard?

            24                MR. KERNER:        Yes, your Honor.

            25                THE COURT:        Very good.

             1                MR. GOMES:        Your Honor, perhaps I missed it.

             2     What term of supervised release did you wish to impose?

             3                THE COURT:        Excuse me.       I thought I did.

             4                MR. BATOR:        I believe the Court indicated three

             5     years.

             6                THE CLERK:        Three years.

             7                MR. GOMES:        Three years?        All right.

             8                THE COURT:        Yes.     A three-year term of

             9     supervised release.

            10                That concludes the proceedings for today, and

            11     I --

            12                MR. BATOR:        Your Honor, I need to state -- to be

            13     heard very briefly as a matter of form for the appellate

            14     court.     I need to state an objection to the sentence for

            15     the basis that it's below the minimum mandatory.

            16                I should also point out that pursuant to Federal

            17     Criminal 32 and United States -- the Supreme Court of

            18     the United States, Burns -- United States v. Burns, 501

            19     U.S., 135,136, the Court is -- the parties are required

            20     to give some notice of a sua sponte deviation from the

            21     guidelines.

            22                I assume this is -- the Court indicated this is

            23     not a departure but a deviation under the 35 --

            24                THE COURT:        That's correct.

            25                MR. BATOR:        -- because -- it's part of what the

             1     rule requires in order to give the parties full

             2     opportunity to comment on the basis for the sentence.

             3                THE COURT:        What section are you referring to?

             4                MR. BATOR:        I'm sorry?       Yes.    Rule -- it's

             5     Federal Criminal Rule 32(i)(1)(C) which --

             6                THE COURT:        Excuse me.

             7                MR. BATOR:        -- mandates that the district court

             8     allow parties to comment on -- relating to appropriate

             9     sentence, in the Supreme Court v. Burns, in providing a

            10     guideline --

            11                THE COURT:        Just give me a chance to look, will

            12     you?    You're going too fast for me.                32(i)(1)(C)?

            13                MR. BATOR:        Yeah.     32(i)(1)(C).

            14                THE COURT:        It's some system.

            15                MR. BATOR:        The Court indicated -- I didn't

            16     invent it myself, your Honor.

            17                THE COURT:        Are you referring to the phrase

            18     which says "must allow the parties' attorneys to comment

            19     on the probation officer's determinations and other

            20     matters relating to an appropriate sentence"?

            21                MR. BATOR:        Yes.     As it's been construed by the

            22     Supreme Court in the Burns case, your Honor, which has

            23     indicated that the parties -- gives the parties some

            24     right to be notified that the Court is contemplating

            25     what a sentence will be in order to give full comment.

             1                THE COURT:        I'm amazed that in my 39 years on

             2     the bench, but in my 13 years here in Boston, this has

             3     never been brought to my attention before.                    If you wish

             4     to start from scratch today, go ahead and give me your

             5     position.

             6                MR. BATOR:        Well, I think it's more to -- all

             7     the Court is saying, and I should add that the office --

             8     the assistant U.S. attorneys are routinely making this

             9     objection so that when we come into court we have some

            10     idea of what to argue -- with regard to what the Court

            11     may be thinking.          All the Court has said this morning is

            12     that the guideline sentence, even at the low end, which

            13     the government -- is excessive, and nothing more.

            14                THE COURT:        That is a word that was used in a

            15     recent commutation of sentence also.

            16                MR. BATOR:        No.    No.     And I don't suggest that

            17     there's anything inappropriate about that.                    But it's

            18     very limited in citing -- for the government to have

            19     some sense of why the sentence is excessive and then to

            20     be able to respond in some sense, is what would fulfill

            21     I think, what the requirements of the rule and Burns

            22     say on --

            23                THE COURT:        I'd be glad to hear anything that

            24     you wish to tell me as to why it is not excessive.

            25                MR. BATOR:        Well, I think the government has

             1     made its arguments with regard to that, your Honor.

             2                THE COURT:        That's what I thought.           I heard you

             3     all.    I don't know what more can be done.

             4                MR. BATOR:        Well, I think having some

             5     understanding of why the Court --
