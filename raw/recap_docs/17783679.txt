                  ORDER AFFIRMING THE
       RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE


         The United States Magistrate Judge filed with the Court on January

   11, 2013 her Recommended Decision (ECF No. 113). The Defendant filed his

   objections to the Recommended Decision on April 1, 2013 (ECF No. 139) and

   the Government filed its response to those objections on April 2, 2013 (ECF

   No. 140). I have reviewed and considered the Magistrate Judge's

   Recommended Decision, together with the entire record; I have made a de

   novo determination of all matters adjudicated by the Magistrate Judge's

   Recommended Decision; and I concur with the recommendations of the

   United States Magistrate Judge for the reasons set forth in her

   Recommended Decision, and determine that no further proceeding is

   necessary.

         1.     It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the
                Magistrate Judge is hereby AFFIRMED.

         2.     It is further ORDERED that the Defendantâ€™s Motion to Suppress
                (ECF No. 92) be and hereby is DENIED.
