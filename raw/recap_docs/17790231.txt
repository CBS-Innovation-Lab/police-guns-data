                         ORDER AFFIRMING THE
              RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE


       The United States Magistrate Judge filed with the Court on April 9, 2013, her Recommended

Decision (ECF No. 226). Plaintiff filed his Objection to the Recommended Decision (ECF No. 227)

on April 29, 2013.

       I have reviewed and considered the Magistrate Judge's Recommended Decision, together

with the entire record; I have made a de novo determination of all matters adjudicated by the

Magistrate Judge's Recommended Decision; and I concur with the recommendations of the United

States Magistrate Judge for the reasons set forth in her Recommended Decision, and determine that

no further proceeding is necessary.



       1.      It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the Magistrate Judge
               is hereby AFFIRMED.

       2.     It is hereby ORDERED that Plaintiff’s 28 U.S.C. § 2255 is summarily
              DISMISSED.

       3.     It is hereby ORDERED that no certificate of appealability shall be issued in the
              event that Plaintiff files a notice of appeal because there is no substantial showing of
              the denial of a constitutional right within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).
