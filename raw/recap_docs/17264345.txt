                                RECOMMENDED DECISION

       On April 24, 2008, Doc Bratt filed a motion to appoint counsel and a motion for relief

from his criminal judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) and the following

day he filed an amended pleading incorporating the same requests and adding a motion for leave

to proceed in forma pauperis. The court has referred the motions to me and I now deny the

motion to appoint counsel and recommend that the court deny the Rule 60(b) motion, treating it

as an untimely motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255. The motion to proceed in forma pauperis is

moot because there is no filing fee associated with this action.

       On January 11, 2001, Doc Bratt received a 180-month sentence after pleading guilty to

two counts of an indictment charging him with possession of a firearm and ammunition by a

prohibited person and alleging three prior convictions of crimes of violence, placing Bratt in the

category of an armed career criminal under the Armed Career Criminal Act. Bratt never

appealed nor did he challenge his conviction (i.e., pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255) until April 24,

2008, when he filed this motion pursuant to Rule 60(b). Bratt concedes that a petition under 28

U.S.C. § 2255 is ordinarily time-barred one year after the judgment becomes final. However, he

seems to believe that by labeling his petition as a motion under Rule 60(b) he can escape that

time bar. The fact remains that his pleading is in reality a § 2255 motion challenging his
 Case 1:99-cr-00066-GZS Document 29 Filed 06/26/08 Page 2 of 4                       PageID #: 83



underlying criminal conviction and, in spite of his labeling rhetoric, it must be dismissed as

untimely unless it falls within the restrictions set forth in § 2255. See Munoz v. United States,

331 F.3d 151, 152 (1st Cir. 2003).

       In order to bring a Rule 60(b) motion in the context of a federal criminal proceeding the

petitioner must be challenging a defect in an actual federal habeas corpus civil proceeding and

not the underlying conviction itself. Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524, 534 (2005). Obviously

Bratt is not mounting such a challenge because he never filed a 28 U.S.C. § 2255 motion and,

thus, there is no federal habeas corpus judgment that he can challenge. Furthermore, the thrust

of Bratt’s argument is that he was wrongly sentenced as an armed career criminal and that

argument goes to the integrity of the underlying criminal conviction. The motion is not properly

brought pursuant to Rule 60(b).

       Because Bratt is obviously challenging his underlying criminal conviction, the court

could only analyze his claim under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. The limitations period for such actions is

set forth in § 2255(f) at one year. More than seven years have passed since Bratt’s judgment of

conviction became final and therefore he is well outside of the limitations period set forth in

subsection (1). His only possible claim would be that he falls within subsection (4), i.e., that it

has been less than one year since the facts supporting his claims could have been discovered

through the exercise of due diligence. Bratt claims his criminal conviction should be set aside

for the following reasons: (1) He was improperly sentenced as an armed career criminal

because his escape charge was nothing more than a "walk away" from a halfway house; (2)

Bratt’s recent inquiries suggest to him that the escape conviction does not even actually exist;

and (3) Bratt's attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel because he was unable to

obtain access to discovery materials that Bratt felt were necessary for his defense and defense

counsel told Bratt at the time of his guilty plea that the Government would not allow the release

of these materials. Obviously items one and three were known to Bratt at the time of his

sentencing. Item number two appears to relate to relatively recent correspondence between Bratt

and the clerks of the Wrentham (Massachusetts) District Court and the Norfolk Superior Court,

dating from August 16, 2007, through April 5, 2008, wherein Bratt has tried, unsuccessfully, to

obtain verification regarding his 1977 conviction for escape or demonstrate the nonexistence of

any records relating to that conviction. However, Bratt has come nowhere near showing the type

of "due diligence" required to re-ignite the one year statute of limitations as of August 2007

when he began making inquiries about the validity of the 1977 escape conviction. As the

Government points out in discussing why this motion would fail even if it had been properly

brought pursuant to Rule 60(b)(1), Bratt "is in a poor position to argue that he has only recently

discovered evidence he served less than a year in prison on a conviction on which he was

sentenced over 25 years ago, which he knew seven years ago was being used to sentence him as

an Armed Career Criminal." Nor can Bratt claim "due diligence" in his effort to obtain proof

that this conviction does not even exist because it was only in 2007 that he even began to take

steps to try to discover what proof of the exceedingly stale conviction did or did not exist.

       The procedural vehicle that Bratt has chosen, a motion for relief from judgment pursuant

to Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, is not available to him other than to

challenge the validity of a prior judgment in a habeas corpus proceeding and Bratt has never

brought such a proceeding. Thus, his motion, which attacks the validity of his underlying

criminal judgment, is time-barred under the only relevant statute of limitations, the one found in

§ 2255(f). Giving the motion an inventive caption cannot save an otherwise time-barred motion

brought to obtain relief which is exclusively the domain of 28 U.S.C. § 2255 proceedings.

Heeding the warning of Castro v. United States, 540 U.S. 375, 381-84 (2003) I am not

recharacterizing Bratt’s Rule 60(b) motion as anything other than what he has called it, but I am

applying the relevant law to the relief he seeks. Melton v. United States, 359 F.3d 855, 857 (7th

Cir. 2004)(“Call it a motion for a new trial, arrest of judgment, mandamus, prohibition, coram

nobis, coram vobis, audita querela, certiorari, capias, habeas corpus, ejectment, quare impedit,

bill of review, writ of error, or an application for a Get-Out-of-Jail Card; the name makes no

difference. It is substance that controls.”).

                                                Conclusion

        Based upon the foregoing I recommend the court deny Bratt’s Rule 60(b) motion.
