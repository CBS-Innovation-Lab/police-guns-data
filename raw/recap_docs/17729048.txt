               ORDER ON DEFENDANT’S RENEWED MOTION
                    FOR JUDGMENT OF ACQUITTAL

      On September 26, 2012, a jury found Levell Matthews guilty on all counts of

a five-count Second Superseding Indictment that had charged him with four

firearms violations and the simple possession of marijuana. On October 16, 2012,

Mr. Matthews renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal. He contends that the

Government failed to produce sufficient evidence to sustain the jury’s verdict on all

five counts and, on the simple possession of marijuana count, that the Government

failed to present evidence that he did not possess a valid prescription for marijuana.

The Court concludes the Government met its burden of proof and produced

sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could have found Mr. Matthews

guilty on all five counts. Further, the Court concludes that, to establish a violation

of 21 U.S.C. § 844(a), the Government is not required to prove that a defendant did

not possess a valid prescription for marijuana because the non-existence of a valid

prescription is not an element of the offense.

I.    STATEMENT OF FACTS

      On March 15, 2012, a federal grand jury indicted Levell Matthews on five

criminal counts. Second Superseding Indictment (ECF No. 47). Count I charged

him with conspiracy to knowingly make false statements in applications to

purchase firearms. Id. at 1. Counts II, III, and IV charged him with being a felon

in possession of firearms. Id. at 3-4. Count V charged him with possession of

marijuana. Id. at 5.

      Mr. Matthews’ case proceeded to trial on all five counts. At the close of the

Government’s case-in-chief, the Court denied Mr. Matthews’ oral motion for a

judgment of acquittal. After a two-day trial, on September 26, 2012, a jury found

him guilty on all counts. Jury Verdict (ECF No. 124). On October 10, 2012, Mr.

Matthews renewed his motion for acquittal pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal

Procedure 29(c). Def. Levell Matthews’ Renewed Mot. for J. of Acquittal (ECF No.

128) (Def.’s Mot.). On October 16, 2012, the Government filed a Response to the Mr.

Matthews’ Motion. Gov’t’s Resp. to Def.’s Renewed Mot. for J. of Acquittal (ECF No.

129) (Gov’t’s Opp’n).

II.   PARTIES’ POSITIONS

      A.       Levell Matthews’ Motion

      First,    without   providing   specifics,   Mr.   Matthews   argues   that   “the

Government, as a whole, failed to produce evidence sufficient to support the counts

of conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.” Def.’s Mot. at 1. Second, he asserts the

Government failed to prove an element of the possession of marijuana offense,



                                            2
Case 1:11-cr-00227-JAW Document 132 Filed 11/05/12 Page 3 of 12          PageID #: 560



Count V, because it failed to produce evidence that he did not possess a valid

prescription for marijuana “as required by 21 U.S.C. § 844.” Id. at 2.

      In support of his acquittal argument for Count V, the Defendant points to

United States Supreme Court caselaw, which states that when a criminal statute

includes an exception, the burden of proof lies with the Government to demonstrate

the Defendant’s conduct does not fall within the exception. Id. at 3 (citing United

States v. Vuitch, 402 U.S. 62 (1971)). To bolster his argument, Mr. Matthews cites

caselaw from other circuits, describing § 844(a)’s elements in general terms, such as

“simple possession of a controlled substance without a prescription.” Id. (citing

United States v. Swiderski, 548 F.2d 445, 449 (2d Cir. 1977)). In sum, he argues

that in light of judicial interpretations of 21 U.S.C. § 844(a) and proper statutory

construction, the lack of a valid prescription is an element of the crime, which the

Government should have but failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. at 4.

      B.     The Government’s Opposition

      The Government responds that Mr. Matthew’s sufficiency of the evidence

claim is baseless because the Government provided sufficient evidence for a

reasonable jury to find him guilty on Counts I-V.             Gov’t’s Opp’n at 1-2.

Furthermore, the Government contends that the “Defendant’s failure to point to any

specific inadequacy highlights the lack of merit of his assertion.”      Id. at 2.   In

support of its position, the Government sets forth a detailed summary of the trial

evidence to show that Mr. Matthews’ guilt was, in fact, proven beyond a reasonable

doubt for each Count. Id. at 3-8.



                                          3
Case 1:11-cr-00227-JAW Document 132 Filed 11/05/12 Page 4 of 12            PageID #: 561



       Next, the Government asserts that Mr. Matthews’ additional argument for

Count V should be rejected because the lack of a “valid prescription or order”

language refers to an affirmative defense rather than an element of the crime. Id.

at 8. The Government distinguishes the cases Mr. Matthews cites because they do

not address § 844(a)’s “unless” clause and fail to discuss the relevant burdens. Id.

at 9. Thus, the Government argues that it met its burden of proof and the jury’s

verdict should stand on all counts. Id.

III.   DISCUSSION

       A.    Legal Standard

       Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(c) allows a defendant to move for

judgment of acquittal and renew that motion within fourteen days after a guilty

verdict is entered. FED. R. CRIM. P. 29(c). When a convicted defendant contests the

sufficiency of the evidence adduced at trial, the court “‘must take that evidence in

the light most favorable to the government and decide whether that evidence,

including all plausible inferences extractable therefrom, enables a rational

factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the

charged crime.’” United States v. Piper, 298 F.3d 47, 58 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting

United States v. Barnes, 244 F.3d 172, 175 (1st Cir. 2001)). “In conducting this

analysis, [the court is] cognizant that the government may satisfy its burden of

proof ‘by either direct or circumstantial evidence, or by any combination thereof.’”

Id. (quoting United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 467 (1st Cir. 1994)). “Moreover,

an inquiring court is, for this purpose, constrained to ‘resolve all credibility disputes



                                           4
Case 1:11-cr-00227-JAW Document 132 Filed 11/05/12 Page 5 of 12          PageID #: 562



in the verdict’s favor.’” Id. (quoting United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 974 (1st

Cir. 1995)). In sum, the Court “ought not to disturb, on the ground of insufficient

evidence, a jury verdict that is supported by a plausible rendition of the record.”

United States v. Wilder, 526 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting United States v. Ortiz,

966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir. 1992)).

      B.     Sufficiency of the Trial Evidence

             1.     Count I: Conspiracy to Make False Statements on
                    Applications to Purchase Firearms

      To prove that Mr. Matthews conspired to make false statements in

applications to purchase firearms, the Government must first show: (1) a person

knowingly made a false statement in connection with the acquisition of a firearm;

(2) that at the time the person made the statement, the person was trying to buy a

firearm from a licensed dealer; and (3) that the statement was intended to, or likely

to, deceive the licensed dealer about a fact material to the lawfulness of the sale. 18

U.S.C. § 371; 18 U.S.C. § 922(a)(6). Next, to establish a conspiracy, the Government

must prove: (1) there was an agreement between two or more people, including Mr.

Matthews, to make false statements in applications to purchase firearms; (2) that

Mr. Matthews willfully joined that agreement; and (3) that one of the conspirators

committed an overt act during the period of the conspiracy in an effort to further

the purpose of the conspiracy. 18 U.S.C. § 371; see United States v. Diaz, 670 F.3d

332, 347 (1st Cir. 2012).

      The evidence against Mr. Matthews was more than sufficient for a rational

jury to find him guilty on Count I. The Government introduced into evidence a

                                          5
Case 1:11-cr-00227-JAW Document 132 Filed 11/05/12 Page 6 of 12         PageID #: 563



videotape from Frati’s Pawn Shop, which shows Mr. Matthews, a felon unable to

legally purchase firearms, visiting Frati’s with Victor Morales and Renee Weeks

several times and handling guns. Gov’t’s Opp’n at 3. The Government also called

as a witness Renee Weeks, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to make false

statements in federal firearms applications, naming Mr. Matthews and Mr. Morales

as her co-conspirators. Id. at 5. Ms. Weeks testified that she falsely filled out

firearm applications by saying the firearms were for her use. Id. at 3. She also

testified that she attempted to procure the firearms from Frati’s specifically for Mr.

Matthews and at his request. Id. at 5.

      Further, after his arrest, Mr. Matthews made statements that a rational fact-

finder could have considered admissions of guilt, including statements such as,

“Frati’s was a go”, “uh oh” in response to being told he was captured on video in

Frati’s, and his statement that he had $4,000 in his sock when in fact there was

$3,700, mathematically explained by the purchase amount of the $294 gun. Id. at

7-8. Given the lack of guidance from Mr. Matthews concerning the substance of his

sufficiency challenge and the Court’s obligation to view all evidence and reasonable

inferences in the light most favorable to the Government, the Court denies Mr.

Matthews’ renewed motion for acquittal on Count I.

             2.    Counts II, III, and IV: Felon in Possession of Firearms

      A defendant will be found guilty of felon in possession of a firearm if the

Government can show: (1) the defendant was convicted in any court of a felony; (2)

that the defendant knowingly possessed a firearm; and (3) that the firearm was



                                          6
Case 1:11-cr-00227-JAW Document 132 Filed 11/05/12 Page 7 of 12         PageID #: 564



connected with interstate or foreign commerce. 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). Before trial,

the parties stipulated that Mr. Matthews had previously been convicted of a felony

in New York and that the firearms at issue affected interstate commerce. At trial,

the Government played a series of videos from Frati’s Pawn Shop showing Mr.

Matthews handling a number of firearms. Because the evidence strongly supports

each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt and Mr. Matthews does not

point to any specific deficiency in the Government’s case, the jury’s verdict on

Counts II, III, and IV, must be sustained.

             3.    Count V: Possession of a Controlled Substance

      Mr. Matthews challenges the sufficiency of the evidence for Count V on two

grounds.   First, as with the other Counts, he makes a blanket non-specific

statement that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the jury’s verdict. Def.’s Mot.

at 2. Second, he asserts that the Government failed to prove one of the elements of

the drug possession offense, namely that he did not have a valid prescription for

marijuana. Id.

      At trial, the Court instructed the jury that the elements for possession of a

controlled substance were: (1) that Mr. Matthews possessed a controlled substance,

namely marijuana; and (2) that he did so knowingly and intentionally. 21 U.S.C. §

844(a). As with Counts I-IV, given that a search incident to arrest revealed Mr.

Matthews had 3.2 grams of marijuana in his underwear, this direct evidence and

any reasonable inferences drawn from it are sufficient to sustain the jury’s verdict

on Count V. Gov’t’s Opp’n at 7. Yet, if the Defendant is correct that possession of a



                                             7
Case 1:11-cr-00227-JAW Document 132 Filed 11/05/12 Page 8 of 12           PageID #: 565



controlled substance requires the Government to prove that Mr. Matthews did not

have a valid prescription for the controlled substance, the Court must acquit the

Defendant on Count V because there was no trial evidence on this issue. To clarify

the elements of 21 U.S.C. § 844(a), the Court examines the statute’s structure and

relevant caselaw.

             a.     Statutory Structure of 21 U.S.C. § 844(a)

       21 U.S.C. § 844(a), which criminalizes simple possession offenses, provides:

       It shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to
       possess a controlled substance unless such substance was obtained
       directly, or pursuant to a valid prescription or order, from a
       practitioner, while acting in the course of his professional practice, or
       except as otherwise authorized by this title or title III.

Id. A related provision, 21 U.S.C. § 885(a), sets forth the burdens of proof for simple

possession offenses.   Id. § 885(a).    Section 885(a)(1) discusses exemptions and

exceptions to burdens of proof and provides:

       It shall not be necessary for the United States to negative any
       exemption set forth in this title in any complaint, information,
       indictment, or other pleading or in any trial, hearing or other
       proceeding under this title, and the burden of going forward with the
       evidence with respect to any such exemption or exception shall be upon
       the person claiming its benefit.

Id.   Section 885(a)(2) directly addresses § 844(a) and states, “[i]n the case of a

person charged under section 404(a) [21 U.S.C.[ ] § 844(a)] with possession of a

controlled substance, any label identifying such substance . . . shall be admissible in

evidence and shall be prima facie evidence that such substance was obtained

pursuant to a valid prescription from a practitioner.” Id. § 885(a)(2).




                                           8
Case 1:11-cr-00227-JAW Document 132 Filed 11/05/12 Page 9 of 12          PageID #: 566



      The Court views the language in § 844(a)―”unless such substance was

obtained directly, or pursuant to a valid prescription or order”―as creating an

exemption or an exception under § 885(a)(1). Because the Government does not

bear the burden to negate any exception in the statute, the lack of “a valid

prescription or order” language in § 844(a) must be an affirmative defense for which

a defendant bears the burden of coming forward with the evidence. This conclusion

is supported by the structure of § 885(a)(2), which statutorily enacts a defendant’s

burden of going forward with the evidence when he asserts that he had a valid

prescription or order for a controlled substance under § 844(a).

      Mr. Matthews cites Vuitch to support his interpretation of § 844(a).          In

Vuitch, an abortion case, the United States Supreme Court addressed whether a

physician accused of performing an abortion had the burden to prove that he did so

to preserve life or health.    402 U.S. at 68-69.     The Vuitch Court rejected an

interpretation of this part of the statute, which would have placed a burden of proof

on the defendant, commenting that to do so would “at the very least present serious

constitutional problems.” Id. at 70. This Court does not view Vuitch as helpful in

resolving this case because § 844(a) does not impose a burden of proof, only a

burden of going forward with the evidence. This conclusion is buttressed by the

Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which stated that “Congress obviously

did not intend to place on the Government the near impossible burden of proving a

negative in order to establish a violation of section 844(a).” United States v. Forbes,

515 F.2d 676, 680 n.9 (D.C. Cir. 1975).

Case 1:11-cr-00227-JAW Document 132 Filed 11/05/12 Page 10 of 12                        PageID #: 567



                b.      Caselaw Outlining the Elements of 21 U.S.C. § 844(a)

        Three Circuits―the District of Columbia, Fourth and Fifth Circuits―have

 held that proof of the lack of a valid prescription or order is an affirmative defense

 rather than an element of a § 844(a) simple possession offense.1 In Forbes, the

 District of Columbia Court of Appeals concluded, “[i]t is clear that the ‘unless’

 clause [of § 844(a)] establishes a defense to be raised by the accused rather than an

 element of the offense to be proven by the Government. If this were not the case,

 there would be no point to section 885(a)(2) . . . .” 515 F.2d at 680 n.9; see United

 States v. Murray, 618 F.2d 892, 901 (2d Cir. 1980) (emphasizing that according to §

 885(a) the defendant bears the burden of going forward with evidence of exemptions

 or exceptions found within any section of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse

 Prevention and Control Act of 1970).              Similarly, in United States v. Foster, the

 Fourth Circuit rejected the defendant’s argument that § 844(a) contained a third

 element because “the exception in § 844(a) for possession pursuant to a valid

 prescription is an affirmative defense that Foster [the defendant] was required to

 establish.” 374 F. App’x 448, 449 (4th Cir. 2010).

        Furthermore, in Woods v. Butler, the Fifth Circuit adopted Foster’s

 interpretation of § 844(a) and concluded, when interpreting a Louisiana statute

 modeled after § 844(a), the “unless” clause established an affirmative defense for


 1 In the context of a defendant’s challenge to his conviction under § 841(a) and § 846, the First
 Circuit cited § 855 and stated, “a defendant claiming the benefit of a medical exemption bears the
 evidentiary burden with respect to its applicability.” United States v. Hooker, 541 F.2d 300, 301-02,
 305 (1st Cir. 1976). The Hooker decision is not dispositive because the First Circuit dealt with
 different sections under title 21, namely § 841 and § 846, not § 844. Id. However, the First Circuit’s
 analysis of § 885’s impact on evidentiary burdens within the statute is consistent with the District of
 Columbia, Fourth, and Fifth Circuit’s view of the burdens under § 844(a).

                                                   10
Case 1:11-cr-00227-JAW Document 132 Filed 11/05/12 Page 11 of 12           PageID #: 568



 the defendant to raise. 847 F.2d 1163, 1167 (5th Cir. 1998) (recognizing that if the

 Court were to adopt a different view of the “unless” clause “the Court would [ ] be

 requiring the State to assume the difficult burden of negating the possibility of the

 existence of a prescription in possession cases”); see also United States v. Felts, 602

 F.2d 146, 148 (7th Cir. 1979) (concluding that pursuant to § 885(a)(1) the defendant

 had the burden of going forward with proof of non-registration for a violation of §

 841(a) and that “to require the government to allege and prove non-registration of

 each defendant . . . would be a substantial waste of government resources”).

       The cases Mr. Matthews relies on to support his interpretation of § 844(a) are

 unpersuasive.    Specifically, Mr. Matthews cites cases which repeat § 844(a)’s

 statutory language generally but do not discuss the impact of § 885 on the elements

 of the crime or the burdens of proof. In Dorszynski v. United States, the Supreme

 Court wrote in a footnote that “§ 844(a) makes punishable the knowing or

 intentional possession of a controlled substance such as LSD when not obtained

 pursuant to a valid prescription or order.” 418 U.S. 424, 426 n.3 (1974). This Court

 does not interpret this dictum as enumerating the elements of the offense or

 discussing § 885(a)’s impact on the statute’s evidentiary burdens; the footnote does

 not alter the Court’s conclusion. See id. For the same reason, United States v.

 Stone, 139 F.3d 822, 834 (11th Cir. 1998), and Swiderski, 548 F.2d at 449, cases

 cited by Mr. Matthews, are unpersuasive because they merely recite the statute’s

 language without further analysis. Notably, in Stone, when stating the elements of

 a § 844(a) offense, the Second Circuit supported its analysis with a Fifth Circuit



                                           11
Case 1:11-cr-00227-JAW Document 132 Filed 11/05/12 Page 12 of 12            PageID #: 569



 case explicitly listing the elements as “‘(1) the knowing possession (2) of a controlled

 substance.’” Stone, 139 F.3d at 834 (citing United States v. Krout, 66 F.3d 1420,

 1431 (5th Cir. 1995)).

       The Court follows the District of Columbia, Fourth, and Fifth Circuits, and

 concludes that § 844(a)’s “unless” language creates an affirmative defense, imposing

 on a defendant a burden of going forward with evidence, rather than a third

 element for a possession offense.     Given the presence of the marijuana in Mr.

 Matthew’s underwear, a reasonable jury could have found him guilty of the simple

 possession charge in Count V of the Second Superseding Indictment.

 IV.   CONCLUSION

       The Court DENIES the Defendant’s Renewed Motion for Judgment of

 Acquittal (ECF No. 128).
