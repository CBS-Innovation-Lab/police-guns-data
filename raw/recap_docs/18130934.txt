                             ORDER ON RESTITUTION

      Amber Meserve was sentenced on March 16, 2016, as a result of her conviction

of a single count of conspiracy to possess one or more stolen firearms, a violation of

18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 922(j). For the reasons explained on the record at the sentencing, I

have concluded that restitution is warranted in this case. What remains for decision

is the amount of restitution that Meserve should be ordered to pay to the victims of

her offense.

      I have carefully considered the sentencing record, the memoranda submitted

by the parties, and the restitution report of Gregory Giblin, Supervisory U.S.

Probation Officer. I find that:

              Amber Meserve pled guilty and admitted to her involvement in a
               conspiracy to possess stolen firearms by means of burglaries that were
               committed with the intent to steal firearms and other property. Under
               the totality of the circumstances, the burglaries “comprised part of a
               unitary scheme” and were an intrinsic aspect of the conspiracy to
               possess stolen firearms. United States v. Hensley, 91 F.3d 274, 278 (1st
               Cir. 1996).

              M.V., T.G., and J.D. are individuals whose homes were unlawfully
               entered and property was stolen in furtherance of the conspiracy. They
               qualify as “victims” for purposes of the Victim and Witness Protection
               Act (“VWPA”), 18 U.S.C.A. § 3663 (2016), because they were directly and
               proximately harmed as a result of the commission of the offense, which
                                             1
Case 2:15-cr-00105-JDL Document 136 Filed 05/18/16 Page 2 of 3                          PageID #: 283



                included conspiracy as an element. See 18 U.S.C.A. § 3663(a)(2).
                Further, M.V., T.G., and J.D. were “directly harmed by the defendant’s
                criminal conduct in the course of the . . . conspiracy[.]” 18 U.S.C.A. §
                3663(a)(2); see also Hensley, 91 F.3d at 277 (“the outer limits of a
                VWPA . . . restitution order encompass all direct harm from the criminal
                conduct of the defendant which was within any scheme, conspiracy, or
                pattern of activity that was an element of any offense of conviction”)
                (citation omitted).

               M.V.’s loss totaled $4,600.00. He received partial compensation from his
                insurance company, Foremost Insurance Group, in the amount of
                $3,249.00. Accordingly, his loss is $1,351.00 (priority 1), and Foremost
                Insurance Group’s loss is $3,249.00 (priority 2).

               T.G.’s loss totaled $6,015.00.1 Of this amount, $5,750 was for medical
                marijuana and medical marijuana seeds. Although marijuana may be
                possessed and grown for medical use under Maine law, see 22 M.R.S.A.
                § 2423-A (2016), it is contraband for purposes of federal law, see 21
                U.S.C.A. §§ 802(6), 812(c) (Schedule I). Accordingly, I decline to award
                restitution for the medical marijuana and medical marijuana seeds, and
                T.G.’s loss for purposes of restitution is $265.00 (priority 1).

               J.D.’s loss is $970.32 (priority 1).


        Having considered the amount of the losses sustained by the victims, and all

other information presented by the parties at sentencing and in their post-sentencing

memoranda and the report of the probation officer, I conclude that the Government

has met its burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that restitution

should be awarded as follows:


                M.V. -                                   $1,351.00 (priority 1)

                Foremost Insurance Group -               $3,249.00 (priority 2)

                T.G.    -                                $   265.00 (priority 1)



 1  T.G.’s total loss is stated as $6,000.00 in the report of the probation officer and in the declaration
of victim losses; this appears to be an arithmetical error, as the sum of the values in the itemized list
included in the victim impact statement is $6,015.00.
