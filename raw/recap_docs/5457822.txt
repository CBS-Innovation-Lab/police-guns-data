                      DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO SUBMIT LETTERS

       Counsel for defendant, Miguel Reyes, moves this Court to accept the attached letters

from defendant’s family, for the Court to consider in connection with his sentencing scheduled

for September 18, 2007. Counsel apologizes for the late filing of these letters, which was due to

an error on defense counsel’s part.
