                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE




United States of America

     v.                                       Criminal No.   11-cr-106-01-B

James A. Currier



                                  O R D E R


     The defendant has moved to continue the December 6, 2011

trial in the above case.        Defendant cites the need for additional

time to prepare for trial.        The government does not object to a

continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, in order to allow the parties additional time

to properly prepare for trial, the court will continue the trial

from December 6, 2011 to February 7, 2012.            In agreeing to

continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ยง

3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the ends of

justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the best

interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
