James Johnson



                                            ORDER


       The assented to motion to reschedule jury trial (document no. 12) filed by defendant is

granted.

       Defendant shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights within 10 days. The court finds that the

ends of justice served by granting a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), for the reasons set forth in the motion.

       SO ORDERED.
