      MEMORANDUM AND ORDER RE: DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO SUPPRESS
                         December 11, 2008

      Christopher Jones ("Jones" or "the defendant") has been

indicted on a single count: being a felon in possession of a

firearm and ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).             He

has moved to suppress evidence obtained from his stop and arrest

on June 19, 2007.

      The search in question took place in the early morning hours

of June 19, 2007, near Cataloni's Bar ("Cataloni's") in

Dorchester, Massachusetts.       The facts regarding the search are

heavily contested, but after a hearing I conclude that the

testimony supports the facts as they are testified to by the

three officers who participated in the search.           The motion to

suppress (docket #26) is DENIED.

I.    DEFENDANT'S VERSION

      According to Jones, who testified at the suppression

hearing,1 he arrived at Cataloni's around 11:00 p.m. on June 18,


      1
        In addition to defendant, Cori William Lewis and Lamont Jenkins
testified. Neither observed the critical facts on which the officers'
testimony was based.

2007.    He had a drink and played pool.        After a time, he went

outside to smoke a cigarette, standing in the exit doorway of the

bar, marked on the street as 12 Hancock Street.           Other customers

were also in the area.       Jones saw an unmarked police car turn

onto Hancock Street and park near the bar.          He finished his

cigarette and walked from 12 Hancock Street to 10 Hancock Street,

the entrance doorway, to re-enter the bar.          Jones was wearing a

tall tee-shirt and pants, held up by a belt.

        As Jones entered the bar, he testified that he was grabbed

from behind by the police for no reason and pulled back to the

patrol car by the back of the belt.         He then put his hands on the

hood of the patrol car.       An officer pushed his head forcefully to

the hood.     When he turned his head to ask the police officer why,

the officer took a swing at his head.          Around this time, another

officer pulled his tee-shirt off over his head.           Jones backed

away to avoid the physical confrontation, but the police tackled

him and beat him in the back of the head, face, and nose.                Jones

yelled for help, but nobody came to his aid.           He required medical

treatment for his injuries.

II.     GOVERNMENT'S VERSION

        The police's story is wholly different.        Trooper Thomas

Duane ("Duane"), and Officer Brian Smigielski ("Smigielski")

testified that they were on patrol during the evening of June 18,


                                      -2-

2007, along with Trooper Walter Baiardi ("Baiardi").            They were

assigned to an unmarked car and were not in uniform, but each

wore a badge around his neck.

        At 11:45 p.m. on June 18, 2007, Smigielski received a call

in his car from his supervisor, Sergeant John Fitzgerald

("Fitzgerald").      Fitzgerald indicated that he had received

information from a confidential informant.          The informant told

Fitzgerald that he or she was in Cataloni’s bar, that he or she

had felt the gun as the defendant walked past inside Cataloni's.

The informant described the man in question as a black male with

corn-rolled hair, wearing black "Dickies" pants, a white

tee-shirt, a red bracelet, and having multiple tattoos on his

arms.    Fitzgerald credited that information even though he had

only known the informant for a week.         During that week the

witness had given Fitzgerald information that had led to an

arrest for crack cocaine and firearm possession.            Fitzgerald told

Smigielski the officers were to “stop him [the individual

identified by the informant] and conduct a threshold inquiry,

check him for firearms.”

        Meanwhile, the patrol officers -- Duane, Smigielski, and

Baiardi -- drove to Cataloni's.         They saw a man standing in the

doorway who precisely matched the description that had been given




                                      -3-
          Case 1:07-cr-10280-RGS Document 37 Filed 12/11/08 Page 4 of 9



over the radio.       They radioed Fitzgerald for further

instructions.

      Fitzgerald told Smigielski the officers were to “stop him

[the individual identified by the informant] and conduct a

threshold inquiry, check him for firearms.”2           Fitzgerald

continued to monitor the situation on the radio.

      As the police pulled up to the curb in front of the bar,

Duane made eye contact with the man.          Jones moved his hands to

his waistband “to make a check of his waistband.”             According to

Duane, that movement was characteristic of a person carrying an

unholstered gun in his waistband.

      Duane and Baiardi got out of the car and approached Jones.

While they were not in uniform, their badges were prominently

displayed.      Duane asked if he could speak to Jones.         Jones did

not reply to the officers but said something to the bar customers

in the area, and tried to reenter the bar.           Baiardi "reached in"

towards Jones and met resistance from the other customers, as

well as Jones who "straight armed" him.           Jones complied briefly

with the officers, walking towards the patrol car.             He then

pushed Duane out of the way and attempted to flee.             Baiardi

grabbed Jones' tee-shirt to slow him down and followed him.


      2
        According to the testimony, officers were instructed that they can
conduct a threshold inquiry of a person suspected of carrying a gun and
inquire if the person has a license.

     As Jones fled, Duane observed that he appeared to be trying

to retrieve something from his waistband.       Duane yelled a

warning, as did Smigielski.     Working together, the three officers

wrestled Jones to the ground as he resisted their efforts to get

him under control.    Smigielski admitted that he "hit Jones

several times in an effort to get him to submit and to keep him

away from the gun."     As the officers tried to subdue Jones,

Jones yelled to the crowd to help him.

     Duane was concerned by Jones' plea because Jones' gun was

lying on the ground between the crowd and the officers.          He drew

his gun and went quickly toward the crowd, which backed away.

     Fitzgerald, who had been listening to the encounter on the

radio, heard Smigielski’s cry for help and drove to the scene.

He found Jones on the ground, the officers trying to get him into

handcuffs, with a firearm to the side of him and a red bracelet

which matched the bracelet the informant had described.

(Fitzgerald also recognized the informant in the crowd that had

gathered around Jones).    Backup units arrived to assist with

Jones' arrest.

III. LEGAL STANDARDS

     The threshold question is whether Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1,

(1968) justified the initial police encounter with Jones.             I

conclude that given the information that the officer had --


                                   -5-
        Case 1:07-cr-10280-RGS Document 37 Filed 12/11/08 Page 6 of 9



Fitzgerald’s very concrete tip, which identified defendant, the

observations of the three officers, including the observation

that defendant was checking what could be a gun in his waistband

-- there was reasonable suspicion justifying a Terry stop.

Specifically, they had a reason to question him concerning the

gun and whether he had a license to carry.         And Jones’ reaction

to that inquiry, running away, violently struggling for the gun,

clearly provided probable cause to arrest.

       To be sure, there may well be a question about where the

Terry stop ended and an arrest began.         When the officers

initially approached Jones, he turned to reenter the bar and said

something to the customers outside.        Rather than allowing Jones

to leave, however, Baiardi reached in and grabbed his arm and

asked him to take a walk with the police.         The officers agreed

that, at that point, Jones was not "free to leave."

       The line between Terry stop and arrest is a fact-intensive

one.   It necessarily involves an evaluation of whether the

measures taken in detaining the suspect can, under the

circumstances, be reconciled with the limited nature of a Terry

stop or whether the arrest-like features of the stop, such as

forcible restraint or lengthy detention, make the detention

tantamount to an arrest.      United States v. Acosta-Colon, 157 F.3d

9, 15 (1st Cir. 1998).      Inquiries undertaken pursuant to a Terry


                                     -6-
         Case 1:07-cr-10280-RGS Document 37 Filed 12/11/08 Page 7 of 9



stop must be reasonably related in scope to the justification for

their initiation.      United States v. Ogden, 703 F.2d 629, 634 (1st

Cir. 1987) (internal citations omitted); United States v. Sharpe,

470 U.S. 675 (1985).       Terry, after all, represented only a

limited exception to the Fourth Amendment's probable cause rule.

        I am persuaded that the brief period of time from the

initial encounter at the door to the bar, through the period when

Baiardi grabbed Jones' arm, up until the point at which Jones

fled was part and parcel of a single and reasonable investigative

stop.    The site was out side a crowded bar; the officers wanted

to know if Jones had a weapon and a license to carry it.             When

Jones seemed to be enlisting other customers to help him, it was

reasonable to take him to a place, the patrol car, where further

inquiry could be safely conducted.

        After Jones' flight and his effort to reach for the gun,

there was probable cause to arrest him.          In assessing probable

cause where an informant is involved, the Court must simply

analyze whether, under a totality of the circumstances, probable

cause existed.      See Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 230 (1983).

Information pertaining to the informant's veracity, reliability,

and basis of knowledge are all pertinent.          Id.   The informant's

veracity is supported by the detailed description given of Jones,

including the red bracelet that the police officers saw and


                                      -7-
         Case 1:07-cr-10280-RGS Document 37 Filed 12/11/08 Page 8 of 9



seized as evidence.       Reliability is suggested by the fact that

the informant had previously supplied information, including a

description of clothing, leading to a valid arrest and a drug

trafficking charge.       On the other hand, reliability is diminished

by the fact that the informant had only given one previous tip to

the police.     Finally, the informant stated his or her basis of

knowledge for the gun -- that he or she had "felt the gun when

[Jones] walked past" inside Cataloni's.

        Two other pieces of information also suggest probable cause

to believe Jones not only had a gun but that he was ready to use

it.   The first is whether Jones made an adjustment to his belt or

waist area when the officers first observed him.            The defendant

argues that one might adjust one's belt or waist area for any

number of innocent reasons.        Even if the action could have more

than one interpretation, in this context the officers'

interpretation was reasonable.        The second is Jones' flight,

while apparently reaching for a weapon.          See, e.g., Illinois v.

Wardlow, 528 U.S. 119, 125 (2000).

        For all the above reasons, defendant Jones' Motion to

Suppress Evidence (document #26) is DENIED.



SO ORDERED.
