CASE NUMBER:  1: 17 CR 10253                           - 001 - WGY

                                       STANDARD CONDITIONS OF SUPERVISION
As part of your supervised release, you must comply with the following standard conditions of supervision. These conditions are imposed
because they establish the basic expectations for your behavior while on supervision and identify the minimum tools needed by probation
officers to keep informed, report to the court about, and bring about improvements in your conduct and condition.

1.    You must report to the probation office in the federal judicial district where you are authorized to reside within 72 hours of your
      release from imprisonment, unless the probation officer instructs you to report to a different probation office or within a different time
      frame.
2.    After initially reporting to the probation office, you will receive instructions from the court or the probation officer about how and
      when you must report to the probation officer, and you must report to the probation officer as instructed.
3.    You must not knowingly leave the federal judicial district where you are authorized to reside without first getting permission from the
      court or the probation officer.
4.    You must answer truthfully the questions asked by your probation officer.
5.    You must live at a place approved by the probation officer. If you plan to change where you live or anything about your living
      arrangements (such as the people you live with), you must notify the probation officer at least 10 days before the change. If notifying
      the probation officer in advance is not possible due to unanticipated circumstances, you must notify the probation officer within 72
      hours of becoming aware of a change or expected change.
6.    You must allow the probation officer to visit you at any time at your home or elsewhere, and you must permit the probation officer to
      take any items prohibited by the conditions of your supervision that he or she observes in plain view.
7.    You must work full time (at least 30 hours per week) at a lawful type of employment, unless the probation officer excuses you from
      doing so. If you do not have full-time employment you must try to find full-time employment, unless the probation officer excuses
      you from doing so. If you plan to change where you work or anything about your work (such as your position or your job
      responsibilities), you must notify the probation officer at least 10 days before the change. If notifying the probation officer at least 10
      days in advance is not possible due to unanticipated circumstances, you must notify the probation officer within 72 hours of
      becoming aware of a change or expected change.
8.    You must not communicate or interact with someone you know is engaged in criminal activity. If you know someone has been
      convicted of a felony, you must not knowingly communicate or interact with that person without first getting the permission of the
      probation officer.
9.    If you are arrested or questioned by a law enforcement officer, you must notify the probation officer within 72 hours.
10.   You must not own, possess, or have access to a firearm, ammunition, destructive device, or dangerous weapon (i.e., anything that was
      designed, or was modified for, the specific purpose of causing bodily injury or death to another person such as nunchakus or tasers).
11.   You must not act or make any agreement with a law enforcement agency to act as a confidential human source or informant without
      first getting the permission of the court.
12.   If the probation officer determines that you pose a risk to another person (including an organization), the probation officer may
      require you to notify the person about the risk and you must comply with that instruction. The probation officer may contact the
      person and confirm that you have notified the person about the risk.
13.   You must follow the instructions of the probation officer related to the conditions of supervision.
