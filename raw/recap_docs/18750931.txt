                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                                       Criminal No.   04-181-PB

Kenneth Knight



                                  O R D E R


     The defendant has moved to continue the October 4, 2005

trial in the above case, citing the need for additional time to

engage in plea negotiations or prepare for trial.            The government

does not object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, in order to allow the parties additional time

to negotiate a plea agreement or properly prepare for trial, the

court will continue the trial from October 4, 2005 to January 4,

2006.     In agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds

pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated

reasons, the ends of justice served in granting a continuance

outweigh the best interests of the public and the defendant in a

speedy trial.
