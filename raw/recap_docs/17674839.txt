VII	 COURT DETERMINATIONS OF RESTITUTION

     A      ~     Restitution Not Applicable.

     B      Total Amount of Restitution:

     C      Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

                  o	 For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 USC 9 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
                       identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 USC 93663A(c)(3)(A)

            2     []	 For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 USC 9 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
                       issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims' losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
                       that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C 93663A(c)(3)(B).

            3     o	 For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C § 3663 andlor required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
                       ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh
                       the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 USC § 3663(a)(I)(B)(ii).

            4	    o    Restitution is not ordered for other reasons. (Explain.)




     D	     0     Partial restitution is ordered for these reasons          (/8   u.s.c. § 3553(c)):
