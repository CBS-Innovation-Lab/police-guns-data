                              UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                                DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND


UNITED STATES OF AMERICA                          :
                                                  :
           v.                                     :           CR No. 05-137S
                                                  :
DOMINGO A. GONZALEZ                               :


                            REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION

Lincoln D. Almond, United States Magistrate Judge


       Pending before the Court is Domingo Gonzalez’s Motion for Leave to Appeal In Forma

Pauperis (“IFP”). (Document No. 234). Because I find that the appeal is groundless and thus not

taken in good faith, I recommend that the District Court DENY Gonzalez’s Motion.

       Gonzalez’s right to appeal in forma pauperis is governed by 28 U.S.C. § 1915 which

provides that, “[a]n appeal may not be taken in forma pauperis if the trial court certifies in writing

that it is not taken in good faith.” 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a)(3). “Because the good faith standard is an

objective one, an appeal is deemed not taken in good faith if the issues presented are frivolous. An

appeal is considered frivolous when it is based on an ‘indisputably meritless legal theory or factual

allegations that are clearly baseless.’” Lyons v. Wall, No. 04-380, 2007 WL 2067661 at *1 (D.R.I.

July 13, 2007) (internal citations omitted).

       In the present case, the Chief Judge Smith denied Gonzalez a Motion for Certificate of

Appealability because Gonzalez “failed to make a substantial showing of the denial of a

constitutional right as to any claim.” (Document No. 228). Gonzalez has still failed to make such

a showing. Because the Court has determined that Gonzalez is not entitled to appeal at all, he is not

entitled to appeal IFP, and I recommend his Motion be DENIED. (Document No. 234).
        Any objection to this Report and Recommendation must be specific and must be filed with

the Clerk of the Court within fourteen (14) days of its receipt. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b); LR Cv 72.

Failure to file specific objections in a timely manner constitutes waiver of the right to review by the

District Court and the right to appeal the District Court’s decision. See United States v. Valencia-

Copete, 792 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1986); Park Motor Mart, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 616 F.2d 603, 605

(1st Cir. 1980).
