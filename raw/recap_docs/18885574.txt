                      UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                   FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 08-cr-131-PB

David Caron



                                  O R D E R

     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

trial scheduled for December 2, 2008, citing the need for

additional time to resolve an underlying case against him in

Hillsborough County and to complete discovery and prepare a

defense.    The government does not object to a continuance of the

trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reasons and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from December 2, 2008 to March 3, 2009.              In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
