                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE




United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 06-cr-18-02-PB

Avery Blodgett, et al.


                                  O R D E R


     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

September 6, 2006 trial in the above case, citing the need for

additional time to review additional discovery not yet produced

by the government and prepare a defense.           The government does not

object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reasons and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from September 6, 2006 to December 5, 2006.

In agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the
         Case 1:06-cr-00018-PB Document 40 Filed 08/11/06 Page 2 of 2

      The August 29, 2006 final pretrial conference is continued

to November 28, 2006 at 4:30 p.m.

      SO ORDERED.
