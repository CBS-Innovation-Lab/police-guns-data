STATEMENT OF REASONS

Vll COURT DETERM]NAT]ONS OF RESTITUT|ON
A [:l ReStitution Not Applicable.

B Total Amount ofRestitution:

 

C Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

l ij For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.SrC. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S C. § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

2 [:I For offenses for which restitution rs otherwise mandatory under lS U.S C_ § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under lS UiSiC § 3663A(c)(3)(B)
3 l:] For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U S C. § 3663 and!or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh

the need to provide restitution to any victims under 13 UiS.C‘ §3663(a)(l)(B)(ii).

4 m Restitutton is not ordered for other reasons (Explairi )

D l:i Partial restitution is ordered for these reasons (18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)):
