VII COURT DETERMINATIONS OF RESTITUTION

     A      v1    Restitution Not Applicable.

     B      Total Amount of Restitution:

     C      Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

                  D   For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatoryunder 18 U.S.C. ยง 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the numberof
                      identifiablevictims is so large as to make restitutionimpracticableunder 18 U.S.c. ยง 3663A(c)(3)(A).

            2     D   For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatoryunder 18 U.S.c. ยง 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
                      issuesoffact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims' losses would complicate or prolong the sentencingprocessto a degree
                      that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.c. ยง 3663A(c)(3)(B).

                       ordered because the complicationand prolongationof the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning ofa restitutionorder outweigh
                       the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U.S.C. ยง 3663(a)(l)(B)(ii).

            4     D    Restitution is not ordered for other reasons. (Explain.)
