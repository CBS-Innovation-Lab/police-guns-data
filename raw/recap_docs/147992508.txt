      RULE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE 52 AND MOTIONS TO TAKE JUDICIAL
                              NOTICE

        A federal prisoner again presses his contention that the Controlled Substances

 Act applies only to licensed professionals who are registered to manufacture,

 distribute, and dispense controlled substances and not to anyone else. After the Court

 affirmed a magistrate judge’s recommended decision denying his habeas corpus

 petition, the petitioner asks the Court to amend its findings and take judicial notice

 of asserted facts, including caselaw and legislative history. Because the petitioner

 has not demonstrated that the Court erred and because judicial notice is

 inappropriate and to the extent appropriate does not affect the Court’s affirmance,

 the Court denies his motions.

 I.     PROCEDURAL HISTORY

        In February 2015, a grand jury indicted Jermaine Mitchell for conspiring to

 distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C.

 § 841 and § 846. Indictment (ECF No. 3); Corrected Indictment (ECF No. 80). At the

 conclusion of a six-day trial from June 20 to June 27, 2016, a federal jury found
Case 1:15-cr-00040-JAW Document 849 Filed 10/07/20 Page 2 of 17          PageID #: 7609




 Mr. Mitchell guilty as charged, that the conspiracy involved two hundred eighty

 grams or more of cocaine base, and that Mr. Mitchell’s own conduct involved two

 hundred eighty grams or more of cocaine base. Minute Entry (ECF No. 512); Jury

 Verdict (ECF No. 520). On February 14, 2017, the Court sentenced Mr. Mitchell to

 two hundred sixty months of imprisonment to be followed by five years of supervised

 release. J. (ECF No. 691). On February 16, 2017, Mr. Mitchell appealed, and on

 September 11, 2018, the First Circuit affirmed the conviction. United States v. Ocean,

 904 F.3d 25, 36-40 (1st Cir. 2018). Mr. Mitchell did not appeal his sentence. Id. at

 28, 35-40.

       On April 24, 2019, Jermaine Mitchell filed a motion to vacate, set aside or

 correct his sentence under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Mot. Under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 to Vacate,

 Set Aside, or Correct Sentence by a Person in Federal Custody (ECF No.764). The

 United States Magistrate Judge filed with the Court on January 10, 2020, his

 Recommended Decision, recommending the Court deny Mr. Mitchell’s 2255 motion.

 Recommended Decision on 28 U.S.C. § 2255 Mot. (ECF No. 810) (Recommended

 Decision). Mr. Mitchell filed his objection to the Recommended Decision on March 6,

 2020, Pet’r’s Resp. to U.S. Magistrate Judge’s Recommended Decision on 28 U.S.C. §

 2255 Mot. (ECF No. 814) (Pet’r’s Obj.), and the Government filed its response on April

 24, 2020. Gov’t’s Resp. to Pet’r’s Obj. to R. & R. (ECF No. 818). The Court affirmed

 the Recommended Decision on May 19, 2020. Order Affirming the Recommended

 Decision of the Magistrate Judge (ECF No. 819) (Order).

         On June 10, 2020, Mr. Mitchell filed a motion to amend its findings under

 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(b). 1               Pet. of Amendments Under Rule 52(b),

 Fed.R.Civ.P. (ECF No. 828) (Pet’r’s First Mot. to Amend Findings). The Deputy Clerk

 of Court docketed Mr. Mitchell’s motion as a motion for reconsideration under Rule

 59(e) on June 15, 2020. Id. On July 2, 2020, the Government responded. Gov’t’s

 Resp. to Pet’r’s Pet. of Amendments (ECF No. 834) (Gov’t’s Resp. to Pet’r’s First Mot.

 clarifying that he had brought his motion under Rule 52(b), not 59(e), which the

 Deputy Clerk of Court docketed on July 8, 2020. 2 Letter to Clerk of Court (ECF No.

 837). In accordance with Mr. Mitchell’s request, the Court corrected the docket and

 reset the periods for the Government’s response and Mr. Mitchell’s reply, treating the

 motion not as a motion for reconsideration, but as a motion for findings of fact and

 conclusions of law under Rule 52(b). Order Regarding Mot. for Pet. of Amendments

 (ECF No. 838). In the order, the Court indicated that the Government was not

 required to file a response beyond what it had already done. Id. On July 17, 2020,

       On July 17, 2020, Mr. Mitchell filed a supplemental motion seeking an order

 directing the magistrate judge to prepare findings of fact and conclusions of law,

 pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a). Mot. Pursuant to Rule 52(a) of the

 Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (ECF No. 840) (Pet’r’s Second Mot. to Amend

 II.   PARTIES’ POSITIONS

       A.     Jermaine Mitchell’s Motions to Amend Findings

              1.     First Motion to Amend Findings

       In his first motion, Mr. Mitchell puts forward two “points worthy of

 correction/clarification” in the Court’s affirmance of the Recommended Decision.

 Pet’r’s First Mot. to Amend Findings at 1. The first is that Mr. Mitchell “noted the

 thrust of Magistrate [Judge] Nivison’s position to be BOTH the matters of procedural

 default AND the question of the term ‘any person’ in 21 U.S.C. § 841” but the Court

 discussed only the procedural default issue. Id. at 2 (capitalization and emphasis in

 original). The second is that the Magistrate Judge was incorrect in his analysis of

 Mr. Mitchell’s argument about the definition of “any person” in 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).

 Id. at 3-4. Mr. Mitchell claims that a “correct understanding of the general term ‘any

 person’ must be gleaned from contextual scrutiny of its use in the law” and cites

 several cases in support, concluding that the Magistrate Judge’s position is “based

 upon his overly broad interpretation of the words ‘any person’ in section 841(a)(1).”

 Id.

       The Government’s response notes that Mr. Mitchell’s concerns are “easily

 allayed” because the Court’s affirmance specifically adopted the reasoning of the

 Magistrate Judge on all issues he decided and stated that they did not merit further

 discussion. Gov’t’s Resp. to Pet’r’s First Mot. to Amend Findings at 1-2. “In light of



                                             5
Case 1:15-cr-00040-JAW Document 849 Filed 10/07/20 Page 6 of 17               PageID #: 7613




 the Court’s clear statement of its de novo review and full adoption of the

 recommended decision,” the Government contends that Mr. Mitchell’s requested

 amendments are “not necessary and would ultimately be redundant to the findings

 already made.” Id. at 2.

        In his reply, Mr. Mitchell repeats his argument that “‘[a]ny person’ refers to

 the ‘authorized registrant.’” Pet’r’s Reply to Gov’t’s Resp. to Pet’r’s First Mot. to Amend

 Findings at 1. He contends that the Magistrate Judge’s Recommended Decision

 included   “statements     of   incomplete   facts”   that   “appears   to   be   material

 misrepresentations of fact,” and therefore “[t]he Record here is vague and incomplete

 due to the informal Magistrate [Judge’s] Opinion adopted by this Court.” Id. at 1-2.

               2.     Second Motion to Amend Findings

        Mr. Mitchell filed a second motion seeking an order “directing the Magistrate

 Judge to prepare a formal Finding of Fact and Conclusions of Law in this Matter that

 conforms to the requirements of Rule 52(a), that are detailed enough to disclose the

 steps by which the Magistrate [Judge] reached its ultimate conclusions on the factual

 issues and Conclusions of Law.” Pet’r’s Second Mot. to Amend Findings at 1. He

 claims this is necessary to allow the record to be complete to “[a]id the Appellate

 Court” on review. Id. at 2. He argues the Magistrate Judge’s “informal opinion does

 not state the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law separately,” “leav[ing]

 [Mr. Mitchell] confused and having to guess as to what factual findings and

 conclusions of law w[ere] made and adopted by this Court.” Id. He specifically claims

 the Magistrate Judge failed to cite any caselaw to support his conclusion. Id. at 3.



                                              6
Case 1:15-cr-00040-JAW Document 849 Filed 10/07/20 Page 7 of 17          PageID #: 7614




       The Government responds by noting that the Magistrate Judge’s “Report and

 Recommendation already has a separate sections for factual findings and legal

 analysis” and argues that “[t]here is no additional requirement under Rule 52 that

 each factual finding and conclusion of law be separately numbered, or any indication

 that compiling findings and conclusions into separate sections in paragraph form

 render those findings and conclusion somehow ‘informal.’” Gov’t’s Resp. to Pet’r’s

 Second Mot. to Amend Findings at 1. The Government contends “the relevant facts

 are that the defendant was indicted for and convicted of violations of Section 841” and

 “[t]hose facts are fairly set forth in the ‘Factual Background’ on page 2 of the

 recommended decision.” Id. While acknowledging that the Magistrate Judge did not

 specifically note the performance of Mr. Mitchell’s counsel at trial “in the factual

 portion of the Report and Recommendation,” the Government argues that the

 Magistrate Judge’s Report and Recommendation “makes clear” that the ineffective

 assistance of counsel claims are “irrelevant when the defendant’s legal claims fail on

 the merits” and “the motions made or not made in this case are fairly reflected in the

 record.” Id. at 2.

       Mr. Mitchell’s reply states that his request is “for the purpose of clarity” and

 argues the Magistrate Judge’s fact finding is “not consistent with the intent of

 Congress, and his conclusion of law partly parrots Section 841” by omitting language

 from 21 U.S.C. § 841. Pet’r’s Reply to Gov’t’s Resp. to Pet’r’s Second Mot. to Amend

 Findings at 1. He asks that “if the Court decides not to refer the motion 2255 back

 to the Magistrate [Judge] as previously requested,” the Court should issue a



                                           7
Case 1:15-cr-00040-JAW Document 849 Filed 10/07/20 Page 8 of 17          PageID #: 7615




 memorandum decision to include:

        1) A statement of the basis for subject matter jurisdiction;
        2) A statement of the applicable law;
        3) Subsidiary findings of fact, including a) an appendix containing full
        subsidiary findings of fact b) a summary of those findings in the term of
        a chronology of significant events; and
        4) Evaluative findings (on mixed questions of law and fact)

 Id. at 1-2.

        B.     Jermaine Mitchell’s Motions for Judicial Notice

               1.    First Motion for Judicial Notice

        In addition to his motions to amend the findings, Mr. Mitchell moves under

 Federal Rule of Evidence 201 for the opportunity to be heard on the propriety of

 judicial notice. Pet’r’s First Mot. for Judicial Notice at 1. He specifically asks the

 Court to take judicial notice that “[d]efining the term ‘any person’ must be gleaned

 from contextual scrutiny of its use in the law and limited to the particular things or

 person(s) described preceding the term (any person),” and requests judicial notice of

 excerpts from two cases: United States v. Palmer, 16 U.S. (Wheat.) 610, 631-32 (1818)

 and United States v. Katz, 271 U.S. 354, 362 (1926). Id. at 1-2.

        The Government objects to Mr. Mitchell’s motion for judicial notice, arguing

 that “[n]one of these are the type of adjudicative fact that is so easily determined as

 to be appropriate for consideration under Federal Rule of Evidence 201.” Gov’t’s

 Opp’n to Pet’r’s First Mot. for Judicial Notice at 1. Rather than adjudicative facts,

 the Governments contends Mr. Mitchell’s proposed assertions “are not factual

 assertions at all, but forms of disputed legislative assertions and legal analysis

 [Mr. Mitchell] wishes the Court to adopt.” Id. Furthermore, the Government argues


                                           8
Case 1:15-cr-00040-JAW Document 849 Filed 10/07/20 Page 9 of 17             PageID #: 7616




 the Magistrate Judge’s Recommended Decision, adopted by this Court, “specifically

 rejected the legal arguments advanced in the proposed judicial notice” and “rejected

 [Mr. Mitchell’s] prior request to take judicial notice of similar legal arguments.” Id.

 at 1-2.

                 2.    Second Motion for Judicial Notice

           Mr. Mitchell again moved for the Court to take judicial notice of alleged

 adjudicative facts, stating that under Federal Rule of Evidence 201(c)(2), a court

 “must take judicial notice of an adjudicative fact that is not reasonably subject to

 dispute when requested to do so by a party who supplies the court with the necessary

 information.” Pet’r’s Second Mot. for Judicial Notice at 1. This time, he asks the

 Court to take judicial notice of the following information: 1) “the legislative history of

 the Controlled Substances Act of 1970;” 2) “the Controlled Substance Act of 1970 is a

 healthcare law that regulates professional healthcare providers and employees . . .;”

 3) “Congress delegated to the Attorney General only the authority to promulgate

 rules relating to ‘registration’ and ‘control’ of the manufacture, distribution, and

 dispensing of controlled substances, and ‘for the efficient execution of his [statutory]

 functions;’” 4) “the term ‘control’ under the (CSA) means ‘to add a . . . substance . . .

 to a schedule.” Id. at 1-2. He cites “Federal Medical Policy,” 21 U.S.C. §§ 821 and

 871(b), and “Definitions under (CSA) § 802(5)” for support to establish the truth of

 these facts. Id.

           The Government objects to Mr. Mitchell’s motion, again arguing that “[n]one

 of these are the type of adjudicative fact that is so easily determined as to be



                                             9
Case 1:15-cr-00040-JAW Document 849 Filed 10/07/20 Page 10 of 17            PageID #: 7617




 appropriate for consideration under Federal Rule of Evidence 201.” Gov’t’s Opp’n to

 Pet’r’s Second Mot. for Judicial Notice at 1. The Government again contends that

 “these are not factual assertions at all, but forms of disputed legislative assertions

 and legal analysis [Mr. Mitchell] wishes the Court to adopt.” Id.

        Mr. Mitchell’s reply repeats his arguments and asserts that it is of “great

 consequence” that the Court take notice of the statutes and legislative history of the

 Controlled Substances Act. Pet’r’s Reply to Gov’t’s Opp’n to Pet’r’s Second Mot. for

 Judicial Notice at 1. He argues that “statutes and legislative history are public

 records and are factual matters that are incontrovertible.” Id.

 III.   DISCUSSION

        21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) states that “[e]xcept as authorized by this subchapter, it

 shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally . . . to manufacture,

 distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense

 a controlled substance.” The crux of Mr. Mitchell’s argument is that the term “any

 person” “refers to authorized persons that manufacture, distribute or dispense

 controlled substance.” Pet’r’s First Mot. to Amend Findings at 5. In his earlier filings,

 he pressed the contention that the Controlled Substances Act applies only to the

 “class of medical, scientific and industrial licensed professionals.” Pet’r’s Obj. at 4.

 In Mr. Mitchell’s view, “the Controlled Substance Act, following the Harrison Act,

 intends to regulate the registrants of licensed professionals in Medicine, Science and

 Industry.” Id. at 5. Mr. Mitchell now writes that “‘[a]ny person’ clearly is anyone

 within the class of persons that § 841 addresses.” Pet’r’s First Mot. to Amend Findings



                                            10
Case 1:15-cr-00040-JAW Document 849 Filed 10/07/20 Page 11 of 17            PageID #: 7618




 at 5. As he is not a licensed registrant, Mr. Mitchell argues that he is not “any person”

 within the meaning of the statute and concludes that § 841 does not apply to him.

 The motions here all stem from this argument.

       A.     Motions to Amend Findings Under Rule 52

       In his first motion to amend findings, Mr. Mitchell makes two main arguments

 for why the Court should amend its order to expressly address: (1) whether the

 Magistrate Judge erred in resting his recommendation on procedural default and in

 failing to reach the merits of his argument, and (2) whether the Magistrate Judge

 erred in failing to address his argument about the definition of “any person.”

       With regard to Mr. Mitchell’s first point, as the Court stated in its affirmance

 of the Magistrate Judge’s recommended decision, Mr. Mitchell is simply incorrect.

 The Magistrate Judge did not base his recommended decision on procedural default.

 Instead, the Magistrate Judge reached the merits of Mr. Mitchell’s substantive

 argument and rejected it as “contrary to law.” Order at 2. The Court explained all of

 this in its order affirming recommended decision. The Court specifically adopted the

 findings and conclusions of the Magistrate Judge and because it agreed with them,

 the Court stated it would “not address those portions of [Mr. Mitchell’s] objection,”

 and then addressed the “procedural default” issue. Id. at 1.

       Mr. Mitchell counters that he “noted the thrust of Magistrate [Judge] Nivison’s

 position to be BOTH the matters of procedural default AND the question of the term

 ‘any person’ in 21 U.S.C. § 841.”       Pet’r’s First Mot. to Amend Findings at 2




                                            11
Case 1:15-cr-00040-JAW Document 849 Filed 10/07/20 Page 12 of 17           PageID #: 7619




 (capitalization and emphasis in original). The Court can do no better than quote its

 order:

          This is not correct. In his original habeas petition, Mr. Mitchell bases
          his arguments about subject matter jurisdiction on the premise that the
          Controlled Substances Act does not apply to him. Mot. Under 28 U.S.C.
          § 2255 to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence by a Person in Federal
          Custody, Attach. 1 (ECF No. 764). The Magistrate Judge rejected this
          assertion as contrary to law, and so rejected Mr. Mitchell’s arguments
          related to subject matter jurisdiction. Recommended Decision on 28
          U.S.C. § 2255 Mot. at 5 (ECF No. 810). The Magistrate Judge did not,
          as Mr. Mitchell contends, state that Mr. Mitchell was foreclosed from
          making jurisdictional arguments due to a procedural default.

 Order at 2.

          As to Mr. Mitchell’s second point, as the Court has stated, the Court reviewed

 the record de novo and concurred with the Magistrate Judge’s view of Mr. Mitchell’s

 arguments related to the definition of “any person” under 21 U.S.C. § 841. Id.

 Nothing in Mr. Mitchell’s motion or its attachments convinces the Court this

 conclusion was incorrect. See Perrier-Bilbo v. United States, 954 F.3d 413, 435 (1st

 Cir. 2020) (“The purpose of Rules 52(b) and 59(e) is to allow the court to correct or

 amend a judgment in the event of any manifest errors of law or newly discovered

 evidence”).

          The Court is also not persuaded by Mr. Mitchell’s request in his second motion

 to direct the Magistrate Judge to prepare formal findings of fact and conclusions of

 law, or alternatively, for this Court to issue a memorandum decision. The Magistrate

 Judge accurately framed Mr. Mitchell’s argument that 21 U.S.C. § 841 “only applies

 to registrants (i.e., physicians) and thus does not apply to him.” Recommended

 Decision at 1. In the recommended decision, the Magistrate Judge described the

                                            12
Case 1:15-cr-00040-JAW Document 849 Filed 10/07/20 Page 13 of 17            PageID #: 7620




 relevant factual background and procedural history—namely that Mr. Mitchell was

 found guilty for conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine

 base in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841 and § 846—and he addressed Mr. Mitchell’s legal

 arguments, explaining why the term “any person” does not refer solely to registrants.

 Id. at 2-7. There is no need for Mr. Mitchell to guess how the Magistrate Judge made

 his decision because the Magistrate Judge’s reasoning is not only plain, but plainly

 correct. The Court concludes that no further findings are necessary.

       B.     Motions to Take Judicial Notice Under Rule 201

       Federal Rule of Evidence Rule 201 provides in part:
       (a) Scope. This rule governs judicial notice of an adjudicative fact only,
           not a legislative fact.

       (b) Kinds of Facts That May Be Judicially Noticed. The court may
       judicially notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because
       it:
           (1) is generally known within the trial court’s territorial jurisdiction;
               or
           (2) can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose
               accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.

 FED. R. EVID. 201.    Mr. Mitchell moves the Court to take judicial notice of the

 following: 1) “[d]efining the term ‘any person’ must be gleaned from contextual

 scrutiny of its use in the law and limited to the particular things or person(s)

 described preceding the term (any person);” 2) excerpts from United States v. Palmer;

 3) excerpts from United States v. Katz; 4) “the legislative history of the Controlled

 Substances Act of 1970;” 5) “the Controlled Substance Act of 1970 is a healthcare law

 that regulates professional healthcare providers and employees . . .;” 6) “Congress

 delegated to the Attorney General only the authority to promulgate rules relating to


                                            13
Case 1:15-cr-00040-JAW Document 849 Filed 10/07/20 Page 14 of 17               PageID #: 7621




 ‘registration’ and ‘control’ of the manufacture, distribution, and dispensing of

 controlled substances, and ‘for the efficient execution of his [statutory] functions;’”

 7) “the term ‘control’ under the (CSA) means ‘to add a . . . substance . . . to a schedule.’”

        As a threshold matter, the Magistrate Judge already denied Mr. Mitchell’s

 attempts to take judicial notice on similar issues because “the matters for which

 [Mr. Mitchell] requests judicial notice are not adjudicative facts.” Recommended

 Decision at 1 n.1; see Order Denying Mot. to Take Judicial Notice (ECF No. 811). To

 the extent that any matters Mr. Mitchell now wishes the Court take judicial notice of

 are new, his arguments have been waived by not previously raising them to the

 Magistrate Judge. See Frank Martin Sons, Inc. v. John Deere Const. & Forestry Co.,

 542 F. Supp. 2d 101, 107 (D. Me. 2008) (“Parties must take before the magistrate, not

 only their best shot but all of their shots”) (quoting Borden v. Sec’y of Health & Human

 Servs., 836 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1987)).

        Nevertheless, as Mr. Mitchell is forcefully pressing this argument and as he

 still faces a long period of incarceration, the Court specifically addresses his

 contentions about judicial notice. First, regarding his request that the Court take

 judicial notice of prior caselaw, Rule 201 does not apply to judicial authority. Recent

 Past Pres. Network v. Latschar, 701 F. Supp. 2d 49, 55 (D.D.C. 2010) (“Rule 201

 provides an avenue for the Court to take judicial notice of reasonably indisputable

 adjudicative facts at any time. FED. R. EVID. 201. It is not clearly an appropriate

 mechanism for acknowledging a persuasive authority, however”). Not surprisingly,

 a judge is not required to take judicial notice of a judicial decision under Rule 201



                                              14

 because a judicial decision is a matter of law, not evidence. In 1972, the advisory

 committee on the Rules of Evidence quoted Professor Morgan:

       In determining the content or applicability of a rule of domestic law, the
       judge is unrestricted in his investigation and conclusion. He may reject
       the propositions of either party or of both parties. He may consult the
       sources of pertinent data to which they refer, or he may refuse to do so.
       He may make an independent search for persuasive data or rest content
       with what he has or what the parties present . . .. [T]he parties do no
       more than to assist; they control no part of the process.

 FED. R. EVID. 201 advisory committee’s note to 1972 proposed rules (quoting Edmund

 M. Morgan, Judicial Notice, 57 HARV. L. REV. 269, 270-71 (1944)). Thus, to review

 Supreme Court precedent, the Court does not need to take judicial notice under Rule

 201 that the Supreme Court issued an opinion. Nothing prevents the Court from

 reading and analyzing relevant Supreme Court and other caselaw. As Mr. Mitchell

 requested, the Court reviewed both the Palmer and Katz citations and the Court

 concludes that the cases Mr. Mitchell cites are unhelpful, as they merely support the

 Court’s conclusion that judicial notice of legislative history is discretionary, and, as

 the Court explains, it finds such notice inappropriate here.

       Nevertheless, the Court specifically addresses Mr. Mitchell’s request that the

 Court take judicial notice of legislative history. If a proponent presents a proper

 predicate, there is authority that a court may take judicial notice of legislative

 history. See Territory of Alaska v. Am. Can Co., 358 U.S. 224, 226-27 (1959) (taking

 judicial notice of legislative history of the bill at issue); Anderson v. Holder, 673 F.3d

 1089, 1094 n.1 (9th Cir. 2012) (“Legislative history is properly a subject of judicial

 notice”); Maine Ass’n of Retirees v. Board of Trustees of Maine Public Employees Ret.

 Sys., 954 F. Supp. 2d 38, 40 n.1 (D. Me. 2013) (stating that legislative history “might

 be considered a matter of judicial notice . . .”). The Court’s authority to take judicial

 notice of legislative history is discretionary. See 1 WEINSTEIN’S FEDERAL EVIDENCE

 § 201.52[3][a] (2d ed. 2020) (“Federal courts may, but are not required to, take judicial

 notice of the legislative history of federal and state law and of municipal ordinances”).

       The Court rejects Mr. Mitchell’s request that the Court take judicial notice of

 legislative history because he has not properly presented the legislative history and,

 in any event, the legislative history does not affect the Court’s decision for four

 reasons. First, as noted earlier, Mr. Mitchell waived the issue by not raising it with

 the Magistrate Judge. Second, to fit within Rule 201, a proponent must demonstrate

 that the fact “can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy

 cannot reasonably be questioned,” FED. R. EVID. 201(b)(2), and the proponent of the

 fact to be judicially noticed has the burden of supplying the Court “with the necessary

 information.” FED. R. EVID. 201(c)(2). Mr. Mitchell simply posits the legislative

 history as fact and he fails to cite any authority for his request concerning legislative

 history. The Court does not know where he has drawn his assertions of legislative

 history. Third, Mr. Mitchell’s assertions of legislative history are facts “subject to

 reasonable dispute” and not subject to judicial notice. FED. R. EVID. 201(b). Finally,

 even if the Court were to take judicial notice of the legislative history proffered by

 Mr. Mitchell, it makes no difference because even if the Controlled Substances Act

 may have been undergirded by healthcare concerns, it does not mean that Congress

 intended to affect only health care providers’ access to addictive substances and not



                                            16
Case 1:15-cr-00040-JAW Document 849 Filed 10/07/20 Page 17 of 17            PageID #: 7624




 to limit and control the availability of highly addictive substances such as cocaine

 base to the public at large. Congress is capable of enacting legislation with more than

 one goal in mind.     Simply because in enacting the Controlled Substances Act,

 Congress intended to regulate professional access to controlled substances does not

 mean it did not also intend to restrict the access of people, like Mr. Mitchell, who

 conspire with others to distribute controlled substances and to possess with the intent

 to distribute controlled substances to members of the general public wholly outside

 the regulatory framework for licensed professionals.

       Accordingly, the Court concludes it is inappropriate to take judicial notice of

 Mr. Mitchell’s proffered legislative history and declines to do so, but even if the Court

 accepts his version of the legislative history of the Controlled Substances Act, the

 legislative history would have no impact on the Court’s affirmance of the Magistrate

 Judge’s recommended decision.

 Rules of Civil Procedure (ECF No. 840), his Request to Take Judicial Notice (ECF No.

 841) and his Motion for Judicial Notice (ECF No. 846).
