                      ORDER OF DETENTION PENDING
                       FINAL REVOCATION HEARING

      Based on proffers of evidence at a detention hearing, the Court concludes

pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3143(a)(1) that the Defendant has not sustained his burden

to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he is not likely to pose a danger to the

safety of any other person or the community if released under section 3142(b) or (c).

I.    PROCEDURAL HISTORY

      On September 29, 2000, Mr. Buckley was sentenced to fifteen years

imprisonment to be followed by five years of supervised release. J. (ECF No. 18). On

April 5, 2013, Mr. Buckley commenced his term of supervised release. Am. Pet. for

Warrant or Summons for Offender under Supervision at 1 (ECF No. 33) (Warrant

Pet.). The Government moved for a summons on March 10, 2016, Pet. for Warrant or

Summons for Offender under Supervision (ECF No. 27), which the Court granted the

next day. Order (ECF No. 28). The Government then moved for an arrest warrant

on March 21, 2016, Warrant Pet., which the Court granted that same day. Order

(ECF No. 34). The Government alleges several violations of Mr. Buckley’s supervised

release:

    1. Regarding Special Condition No. 2, which, inter alia, proscribes drug

       use, the Government alleges that Mr. Buckley tested positive for

       marijuana, benzodiazepines, morphine, and oxycodone and that he

       admitted to using marijuana and oxycodone.

    2. Regarding Standard Condition No. 11, which requires the Defendant

       to notify the Probation Office within seventy-two hours of being

       arrested or questioned by the police, the Government alleges that Mr.

       Buckley had three interactions with police: (1) on February 20, 2016,

       for a disorderly conduct warning at St. Joseph’s Hospital in Bangor;

       (2) on February 21, 2016, for criminal trespass for refusing to leave

       then returning to the Bangor International Airport (BIA) after

       having been ordered not to do so; and (3) on February 27, 2016, for

       criminal mischief, disorderly conduct, refusing to sign the summons,

       and assault on an officer at Eastern Maine Medical Center (EMMC)

       in Bangor. According to the Government, Mr. Buckley failed to notify

       the Probation Office within seventy-two hours after each of these

       interactions with police.

    3. Regarding the Preamble, which prohibits the Defendant from

       committing another federal, state, or local crime, the Government

       alleges that the February 21, 2016 incident at BIA constituted a

       violation; that the February 27, 2016 incident at EMMC constituted

       a violation; and that on March 19, 2016, the Defendant committed

          another violation when he was placed under arrest for theft at Wal-

          Mart Supercenter in Brewer, Maine.

Warrant Pet. at 1-2.

      On April 13, 2016, the Court held an initial appearance on the supervised

release revocation proceeding. Min. Entry (ECF No. 48). At the initial appearance,

Mr. Buckley waived his right to a preliminary hearing under Federal Rule of

Criminal Procedure 32.1(b)(1)(A) to determine whether there is probable cause to

believe that he violated a condition of supervised release. Waiver (ECF No. 50). Mr.

Buckley did, however, request a detention hearing pending resolution of the

revocation proceeding. Min. Entry (ECF No. 48). On April 14, 2016, the Court held

the detention hearing.

II.   LEGAL STANDARD

      Pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.1(a)(6), “The magistrate

judge may release or detain the person under 18 U.S.C. § 3143(a)(1) pending further

proceedings. The burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that the

person will not flee or pose a danger to any other person or to the community rests

with the person.” FED. R. CRIM. P. 32.1(a)(6); see also FED. R. CRIM. P. 46(d) (“Rule

32.1(a)(6) governs release pending a hearing on a violation of probation or supervised

release”). Section 3143(a)(1), referred to in Rule 32.1(a)(6), requires detention “unless

the judicial officer finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person is not likely

to flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community if released

under section 3142(b) or (c).” 18 U.S.C. § 3143(a)(1).

        Thus, Mr. Buckley has the burden of establishing by clear and convincing

evidence that there are conditions or combinations of conditions which will

reasonably assure the safety of another person or the community and that there is no

danger that he will flee.

III.    APPLICATION

        Based on the proffer presented at the hearing, the Court concludes that Mr.

Buckley has not met his burden. First, the Court notes that the revocation hearing

is scheduled for May 11, 2016, less than a month from today. Second, the Court

observed during the detention hearing that Mr. Buckley appeared to be in poor

health, it heard that he has been frequently hospitalized of late, and it is concerned

that he might not get the medical help he needs if he were to be released. Third, Mr.

Buckley was unable to present solid plans as to where he would be living were he to

be released. While Mr. Buckley indicated that he might be able to stay with a friend

named Chris1 or that he might be able to rent a room from a landlord in Brewer, the

Court has grave concerns that Mr. Buckley would end up on the street without a place

to stay. Fourth, Mr. Buckley has a lengthy criminal record, including several felonies,

which suggests that, if released, he may pose a danger to the community. Finally,

the Government’s allegations regarding the supervised released violations—though

not yet proved—comprise a series of disturbing incidents that only heighten the

Court’s concern that Mr. Buckley may pose a danger to the community, especially

since two of the incidents allegedly occurred at local hospitals and, given Mr.


1      Mr. Buckley was unable to recall his friend’s last name, although he did state that Chris lives
near Essex Street in Bangor.

                                                  4

Buckley’s physical condition, he might present himself back at those hospitals for

treatment.

IV.   CONCLUSION

      The Court ORDERS Mr. Buckley to be detained pending the revocation

hearing.

      SO ORDERED.
