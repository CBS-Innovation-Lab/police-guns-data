                      UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
                                       v.
                                 LUIS LOPEZ

                 MEMORANDUM AND ORDER ON
           DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO VACATE CONVICTION

                             November 18, 2020

STEARNS, D.J.
      Defendant Luis Lopez pled guilty on October 11, 2016, to being a felon
in possession of a firearm pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 922(g). On January 12,
2017, he was sentenced by the court to 180 months of imprisonment followed
by 36 months of supervised release. As the indictment was returned and
the plea taken prior to the Supreme Court’s decision in Rehaif v. United
States, 139 S. Ct. 2191 (2019), neither the indictment nor the district court in
the plea colloquy explicitly informed Lopez that scienter is an essential
element of the offense; specifically that the government was required to
prove that, at the time of the offense, he knew that he belonged to the
category of persons (convicted felons) who are prohibited from possessing
firearms and ammunition. He now moves to vacate his conviction based on
Rehaif.   As the motion is legally, and for all material purposes, factually
foreclosed by the First Circuit’s plain error analysis in United States v.

     1  I also rely on Judge Saris’s concise and reasoned explanation of the
legal framework undergirding Rehaif as she sets it out in United States v.
Windley, 2020 WL 4583843 (D. Mass. August 10, 2020).
