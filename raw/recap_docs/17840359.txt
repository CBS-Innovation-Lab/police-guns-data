                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

                     FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND



 UNITED STATES

       v.                                             CR. No. 06-062-ML

 PEDRO MICHAEL GONCALVES



                            MEMORANDUM AND ORDER

       Petitioner Pedro Michael Goncalves(“Goncalves”), proceeding

 pro se, has filed a timely motion to vacate, set aside, or correct

 his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255, based entirely on the

 alleged ineffectiveness of both his appointed and his retained

 counsel. For the reasons stated below, Goncalves’ motion is denied.

       I.   Background and Travel

       Goncalves was indicted by a grand jury on May 10, 2006 on

 possession with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base in

 violation of 21 U.S.C. §841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A)-(C) (Counts I-III);

 being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C.

 §922(g)(Count IV); and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a

 drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. §924(c)(Count V).

 (Dkt. No. 1). The details of the offenses with which Goncalves was

 charged are set forth in United States v. Goncalves, 642 F.3d 245,

 247-248 (1st Cir. 2011), cert. denied, –U.S.–, 132 S.Ct. 596, 181

 L.Ed.2d 437 (2011) and, therefore, only a brief summary is provided

 here. However, the complicated procedural history of the case is

 set forth in some detail.

       In February 2006, after a confidential informant told law

 enforcement that Goncalves was distributing drugs and was armed

 with a semi-automatic handgun, Goncalves became the subject of

 surveillance and several controlled drug buys. Id. at 247. On May

 3, 2006, after Goncalves became aware of the surveillance, he led

 police on a high-speed chase which ended with Goncalves crashing

 his car1    in his mother’s driveway in Pawtucket. Id. at 248.

 Following his arrest, police found $1,081 in cash and two cell

 phones on Goncalves. A search of the car revealed 65.43 grams of

 powder cocaine hidden in the gas tank cap and a loaded and cocked

 .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol hidden under the hood. Id. at

 248. During a search pursuant to a warrant, Police also found 10.43

 grams of crack cocaine in Goncalves’ bedroom at his mother’s house

 in   Pawtucket   and   92.43 grams     of     crack   cocaine      in Goncalves’

 Providence     apartment,     together      with      a   selection    of   drug

 paraphernalia. Id.

       On May 15, 2006, an attorney was appointed to represent

 Goncalves. On August 25, 2006, Goncalves entered a plea agreement

 (Dkt. No. 18), but he withdrew the agreement just prior to the

 scheduled    change    of   plea   hearing.    (Minute     Entry    10/17/2006).

 Goncalves then parted ways with his court-appointed attorney and

       1

       At the time, the car was registered to Goncalves’s girlfriend.

Case 1:06-cr-00062-ML-PAS Document 142 Filed 02/06/14 Page 3 of 15 PageID #: 671



 retained private counsel to represent him. (Dkt. No. 31). On

 November 15, 2006, Goncalves filed a motion for a Franks2 hearing

 in which he sought to suppress all evidence found during the search

 made pursuant to a warrant. (Dkt. No. 37).

       On November 17, 2006, the government filed an Information

 pursuant to 21 U.S.C. §851, giving notice that Goncalves had a

 previous conviction for a felony drug offense which doubled the

 mandatory minimum prison term on Count I from ten to twenty years.3

 (Dkt. No. 40). The felony drug offense at issue related to a 2001

 Rhode Island state court conviction (P2/01-1460A) for the delivery

 of marijuana, for which Goncalves received a two-year suspended

 sentence and two years’ probation. At the time of that offense,

 Goncalves was 19 years old.

       On November 30, 2006, Goncalves filed a motion to suppress the

 crack cocaine and the weapon found in the car he was driving on the

 day of his arrest. (Dkt. No. 47). After a hearing on Goncalves’

 motions on January 4 and 5, 2007, the motion for a Franks hearing

 was denied. Likewise, Goncalves’ motion to suppress the evidence

      Under the plea agreement, Goncalves would have been subject to
 a mandatory minimum term of ten years on Count I, which indicated
 that the government did not intend to file a §851 if Goncalves
 proceeded with his guilty plea pursuant to the plea agreement. The
 penalty for the gun offense in Count V was a mandatory consecutive
 five-year term. Plea Agreement at 6-7 (Dkt. No. 18).

 located in the car was denied. (Dkt. No. 58). The case proceeded to

 trial.

        On March 1, 2007, following a four-day trial before a jury,

 Goncalves was convicted on all five counts of the indictment. (Dkt.

 No.    69).   Sentencing           was   scheduled         for   June   15,    2007.    Upon

 Goncalves’ request, the sentencing was rescheduled to June 18, 2007

 (Docket Entry 06/08/2007). After Goncalves’ counsel raised a number

 of sentencing issues at the June 18, 2007 sentencing hearing, he

 was    granted     an   additional          60   days       to   develop   the      defense’s

 argument. The sentencing was re-scheduled for August 23, 2007.

 (Docket Entry 06/18/2007). That date was subsequently vacated, to

 be    re-scheduled      at     a    later    date.         (Docket   Entry    07/27/2007).

 Sentencing       was    then       scheduled         for   October   23,     2009    and,    at

 Goncalves’ request, re-scheduled for October 29, 2007.

        On October 7, 2009, Concalves requested a further continuation

 of his sentencing to December 2009, noting that “[t]he House

 Judicial [sic] Sub-Committee on Terrorism and Homeland Security in

 July 2009, approved a bill designed to end the disparity in

 sentencing for federal crack and powder cocaine offenses and there

 is a strong likelihood of the bill passing when the House and

 Senate reconvenes in November 2009.” Mot. Cont. Sentencing (Dkt.

 No.107). The motion was granted and sentencing was re-scheduled for

 December      8,   2009.       Goncalves         submitted       further     requests       for

 continuation of the sentencing hearing on December 7, 2009 (Dkt.


                                                  4
Case 1:06-cr-00062-ML-PAS Document 142 Filed 02/06/14 Page 5 of 15 PageID #: 673



 No. 108) and February 3, 2010 (Dkt. No. 110), both of which were

 granted.

       On March 19, 2010, Goncalves was sentenced to (1) twenty

 years’ imprisonment on Counts I, II, and III, to run concurrently;

 (2) ten years on Count IV, also to run concurrently; and (3) five

 years on Count V, to run consecutively; all such sentences to be

 followed by concurrent terms of supervised release. (Dkt. No. 115).

 Goncalves’ motion for a downward departure was terminated on the

 grounds that the case was a non-guideline case to which statutory

 mandatory minimums applied. (Oral Order 03/19/2010).

       On March 23, 2010, Goncalves appealed his conviction and

 sentence, arguing that (1) the gun and powder cocaine found in his

 car after his arrest should have been suppressed; and (2) his

 sentence should be calculated under retroactive application of the

 Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (the “FSA”).

       On August 3, 2010, the President signed the FSA which reduced

 the mandatory minimums for certain drug crimes.            United States v.

 Goncalves, 642 F.3d at 252. Under the FSA, the mandatory minimum

 for 92.43 grams of crack cocaine with a prior drug felony would

 have resulted in a sentence of ten years instead of the twenty

 years Goncalves received on Count I; no          mandatory minimum would

 have applied to Counts II and III.

       On April 28, 2011, the First Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed

 Goncalves’    conviction    after    determining    that   the   search    of


                                       5
Case 1:06-cr-00062-ML-PAS Document 142 Filed 02/06/14 Page 6 of 15 PageID #: 674



 Goncalves’ car was valid. Id. at 251. With respect to Goncalves’

 sentencing argument, the First Circuit concluded that the FSA was

 “clearly inapplicable to this case,” while acknowledging that “in

 human terms, the result is much less attractive.” Id. at 254-255.

 Accordingly,     the   Court   of   Appeals   affirmed    the   twenty-year

 mandatory minimum sentence on Count I, the concurrent sentences on

 the weapons charge in Count IV, and the consecutive term imposed on

 the weapons charge in Count V. Id. at 225.           Upon invitation by the

 government, the sentences on Count II (which carried a mandatory

 minimum of ten years) and on Count III (which did not carry a

 mandatory minimum) were vacated and remanded for re-sentencing.

 Subsequently, those two sentences were both modified to 97 months’

 imprisonment, to run concurrently. (Dkt. No. 134).

       Following the First Circuit’s decision on Goncalves’ direct

 appeal, Goncalves filed a timely motion under 28 U.S.C. §2255 to

 vacate, set aside, or correct sentence (Dkt. Nos. 132, 135) based

 on the contention that he received ineffective assistance of

 counsel.4 The government filed a response in opposition (Dkt. No.

       4

      The Court notes that, in a footnote to his memorandum,
 Goncalves requests appointment of counsel and a hearing on his §
 2255 motion. Goncalves’ Mem. at Page 15 of 25, FN 5 (Dkt. No. 135).

      With respect to the former, it is well established that “[a]
 convicted criminal has no constitutional right to counsel with
 respect to habeas proceedings[,]” and that includes habeas
 petitions raising claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.
 Ellis v. United States, 313 F.3d 636, 652 (1st Cir.2002). However,
 the Court has the discretion to appoint counsel for an indigent
 litigant in “exceptional circumstances[.]” Cookish v. Cunningham,

                                       6
Case 1:06-cr-00062-ML-PAS Document 142 Filed 02/06/14 Page 7 of 15 PageID #: 675



 139), to which Goncalves filed a reply. (Dkt. No. 141).

       II. Standard of Review

       Pursuant to Section 2255, “[a] prisoner in custody under

 sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming the

 right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed

 in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or

 that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or

 that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law,

 or is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may move the court

 which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the



 787 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1986).
      Because this Court deems the record of the case sufficient to
 determine whether Goncalves received ineffective assistance of
 counsel and Goncalves’ submissions demonstrate that he is entirely
 capable of presenting his case, the Court concludes that this is
 not an exceptional case which would benefit from the appointment of
 counsel.
      With respect to the latter, a hearing on a petitioner's § 2255
 motion is required “unless it plainly appears from the motion, any
 attached exhibits, and the record of prior proceedings that the
 moving party is not entitled to relief.” Rule 4(b) of the Rules
 governing Section 2255 Proceedings in the United States District
 Courts, 28 U.S.C.A. § 2255. However, the Court may dismiss the
 motion without a hearing where, even assuming that “the
 petitioner's allegations are true, the petitioner would not be
 entitled to relief, or where the court cannot accept the
 petitioner's allegations as true because ‘they are contradicted by
 the record, inherently incredible, or conclusions rather than
 statements of fact.’” Fernandez-Malave v. United States, 502
 F.Supp.2d 234, 241 (D.P.R., Jun. 30, 2007 (quoting Dziurgot v.
 Luther, 897 F.2d 1222, 1225 (1st Cir.1990)).
      In   this  case,   because   Goncalves’ contentions assert
 conclusions and are contradicted by the record, the Court
 determines that no evidentiary hearing is necessary.

 sentence.” 28 U.S.C. § 2255(a).

       Relief under Section 2255 is available only if the Court finds

 a lack of jurisdiction, constitutional error, or a fundamental

 error of law.      See United States v. Addonizio, 442 U.S. 178, 184-

 84, 99 S.Ct. 2235, 60 L.Ed.2d 805         (1979) (holding that “an error

 of law does not provide a basis for a collateral attack unless the

 claimed error constituted a ‘fundamental defect which inherently

 results in a complete miscarriage of justice.’”)(quoting Hill v.

 United States, 368 U.S. 424, 428, 82 S.Ct. 468, 471, 7 L.Ed.2d 417

 (1962)). A fundamental error of law is a defect “‘which inherently

 results in a complete miscarriage of justice’ or ‘an omission

 inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.’”

 Knight v. United States, 37 F.3d 769, 772 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting

 Hill v. United States, 368 U.S. at 428, 82 S.Ct. at 471)).

       Generally, claims of sentencing errors are not cognizable in

 a § 2255 proceeding absent “exceptional circumstances;” however, a

 petition does not face the same hurdle for claims of ineffective

 assistance    of   counsel   regarding    sentencing.   Knight   v.   United

 States, 37 F.3d 769, 773–74 (1st Cir.1994).

       Under the Sixth Amendment, each defendant is guaranteed the

 right to effective assistance of counsel. To prevail on a claim of

 ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner must show: that (1)

 counsel’s performance was deficient, i.e. “counsel's performance

 fell below an objective standard of reasonableness;” and (2) the


                                       8
Case 1:06-cr-00062-ML-PAS Document 142 Filed 02/06/14 Page 9 of 15 PageID #: 677



 deficient performance prejudiced the defense, i.e. “a reasonable

 probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the

 result of the proceeding would have been different.” Strickland v.

 Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687–88, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d

 674 (1984).

       To satisfy the first prong under Strickland, “the defendant

 ‘must identify the acts or omissions of counsel that are alleged

 not to have been the result of reasonable professional judgment,’

 and the court then determines whether, in the particular context,

 the identified conduct or inaction was ‘outside the wide range of

 professionally competent assistance.’” United States v. Manon, 608

 F.3d 126, 131 (1st Cir.2010) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at

 690)). “Judicial scrutiny of the defense counsel's performance is

 ‘highly deferential,’ and the defendant must overcome a ‘strong

 presumption ... that, under the circumstances, the challenged

 action ‘might be considered sound trial strategy.’” Bucci v. United

 States, 662 F.3d 18, 30 (1st Cir. 2011)(quoting Strickland, 466

 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052).

       With    regard    to   the   second    prong,    “[t]o    demonstrate

 ‘prejudice,’ the defendant must show ‘a reasonable probability

 that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the

 proceeding would have been different.’” United States v. Rodriguez,

 675 F.3d 48, 57 (1st Cir. 2012)(quoting Porter v. McCollum, 558

 U.S. 30, 38-39, 130 S.Ct. 447, 453, 175 L.Ed.2d 398 (2009)).

Case 1:06-cr-00062-ML-PAS Document 142 Filed 02/06/14 Page 10 of 15 PageID #: 678



  Although the defendant is not required to show “‘that counsel's

  deficient conduct more likely than not altered the outcome’” of his

  trial,[] it does require “‘a probability sufficient to undermine

  confidence in [that] outcome.’” United States v. Rodriguez, 675

  F.3d at 57 (quoting Porter, 558 U.S. at 43, 130 S.Ct. at 455–56)).

       III. Goncalves’ § 2255 Motion

       A. Application of the FSA

       In his motion, Goncalves first alleges that counsel was

  ineffective for “failing to move . . . [Goncalves’] sentencing date

  in contemplation of the passing and presidential signing of the

  [FSA].” Goncalves’ Mem. at Page 6 of 25 (Dkt. No. 135).                    As

  Goncalves freely acknowledges, however, “counsel of record filed

  for continuances through the proceedings.” Id. at Page 9 of 25. A

  review of the record reveals that Goncalves’ counsel successfully

  requested at least five continuances of the sentencing hearing.

  Although the sentencing hearing was initially scheduled for June

  15, 2007 (Docket Entry 03/02/2007), sentencing did not take place

  until March 19, 2010, almost three years after the trial had

  concluded. (Dkt. No. 115). During that time, counsel specifically

  requested    continuances     “in   light   of   the   fact   that    several

  Congressmen have introduced bills in both the House and the Senate

  seeking to modify the disparities between crack cocaine and powder

  cocaine.” Mot. Cont. Sentencing at 1 (Dkt. No. 107).

       The    transcript   of   the   sentencing    hearing     also   supports


                                       10
Case 1:06-cr-00062-ML-PAS Document 142 Filed 02/06/14 Page 11 of 15 PageID #: 679



  Goncalves’ acknowledgment that his counsel again addressed the

  anticipated passage of the FSA at some length and argued for a

  lower sentence on that ground. Transcript of Sentencing Hearing

  03/19/2010 at 10:4-12:15, 13:22-14:6, 14:9-10.

       At the time sentencing was imposed, it was unclear when, and

  to what extent, the drug laws would be changed. Although the FSA

  was enacted only four months after Goncalves’ sentencing, its

  retroactivity was not established until 2012. See Dorsey v. United

  States,   –    U.S.–,   132    S.Ct.    2321,    183    L.Ed.2d    250    (2012)

  (determining    that    the   FSA   applied     to   offenders    whose   crimes

  preceded the effective date of the FSA, but who were sentenced

  after that date, August 3, 2010.)

       Under those circumstances, and in light of the continuing and

  successful efforts by Goncalves’ counsel to delay sentencing by

  almost three years, counsel’s failure to request yet another

  continuance cannot be said to fall “‘outside the wide range of

  professionally competent assistance.’” United States v. Manon, 608

  F.3d at 131 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690). Moreover, there

  is no indication that this Court would have granted such a request

  and that it would have continued the hearing for more than four

  months beyond the three years the matter was already pending.

       B. Prior Ownership of Goncalves’ Car

       As the second ground for his ineffective assistance of counsel

  claim, Goncalves suggests that his counsel should have inquired


                                         11
Case 1:06-cr-00062-ML-PAS Document 142 Filed 02/06/14 Page 12 of 15 PageID #: 680



  whether the car Goncalves was driving prior to his arrest had been

  previously owned and whether it had been purchased at an auction or

  dealership. Goncalves Mem. at Page 11 of 25. Goncalves broadly

  contends that such an inquiry might have created reasonable doubt

  as to his knowledge of the gun that was found wedged under the hood

  of the car. Id.

       The   record   in   this   case    reveals   that   police   knew   that

  Goncalves regularly used the car to make drug deliveries, United

  States v. Goncalves, 642 F.3d at 249, and that he had done so for

  months preceding his arrest. Likewise, the police had been informed

  that Goncalves possessed a handgun. Id. After Goncalves led police

  on a high-speed chase, after which he “apparently [tossed] away the

  key,” the gun was found “wedged under the hood - loaded and cocked

  - where it could be retrieved with a single movement once the hood

  was popped open.” Id. Goncalves’ flight from police “supported the

  inference that drugs or guns - here, both- were knowingly concealed

  within.” Id.

       It is undisputed that Goncalves’ counsel sought to suppress

  evidence of the gun and drugs found in the car. Goncalves’ Mot.

  Suppress (Dkt. No. 47). The motion was denied by this Court and its

  denial was upheld on direct appeal. United States v. Goncalves, 642

  F.3d at 251. Nothing in the record or in Goncalves’ petition

  suggests that further inquiry into the origin of the car would have

  yielded evidence creating reasonable doubt as to the ownership


                                         12
Case 1:06-cr-00062-ML-PAS Document 142 Filed 02/06/14 Page 13 of 15 PageID #: 681



  and/or possession of the gun. Rather, the evidence demonstrated

  that Goncalves had been regularly using the car for an extended

  period of time and that the gun was found fully loaded, within easy

  access of Goncalves.

       Under those circumstances, the absence of any inquiry into

  prior ownership of the car cannot be deemed an “unprofessional

  error,” nor is there any indication - in view of the overwhelming

  evidence against Goncalves - that “the result of the proceeding

  would have been different.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. at

  687–88.

       C. Goncalves’ Decision to reject the Plea Agreement

       In his final argument, Goncalves states that neither his

  appointed nor his retained counsel informed him that, even if

  Goncalves had succeeded in suppressing evidence of the gun, he

  still would have received an enhanced sentence under the guidelines

  for possession of the gun based on statements by an informant.

  Goncalves Mem. at Page 18-19 of 25.         Goncalves suggests that, had

  he known of this fact, he would have taken the plea agreement

  offered by the government. Id. at Page 20 of 25.

       It is indisputable that this Court had no choice but to impose

  a very significant sentence for the offenses of which Goncalves was

  convicted at trial. It is also indisputable that, had Goncalves

  entered a guilty plea, the statutory minimum sentence on Count I,

  imprisonment,     half     of   what   Goncalves     ultimately     received.    In

  addition,     Goncalves     was   subject     to   the   consecutive    five-year

  sentence for the gun offense in Count V.                      As such, the total

  sentence Goncalves received was driven by statutory mandatory

  minimums, not by application of the guidelines.

        At the time Goncalves elected not to proceed with his plea

  under the agreement, his motion to suppress had not been raised

  yet. Accordingly, Goncalves made his decision to proceed to trial

  without knowing whether or not the gun that was found during the

  search of his car would be admitted. After the motion was denied,

  the   resulting     consecutive        five-year    sentence      for   Goncalves’

  conviction on Count V was statutorily mandated; it was not the

  result of guideline enhancements for relevant conduct.

        In other words, even if, as Goncalves now asserts, his counsel

  failed to advise him that Goncalves could receive additional points

  under   the    sentencing       guidelines     based     on    statements   by   an

  informant, Goncalves fails to show how such an omission resulted in

  “a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional

  errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.”

  United States v. Rodriguez, 675 F.3d at 57.

        V.      Conclusion

        For all of the foregoing reasons, Goncalves’ motion to vacate,

  set aside, or correct his sentence is DENIED and DISMISSED.

                  Ruling on Certificate of Appealability

       Pursuant    to   Rule   11(a)   of   the   Rules   Governing   §   2255

  Proceedings for the United States District Courts, this Court

  hereby finds that this case is not appropriate for the issuance of

  a certificate of appealability because Goncalves has failed to make

  “a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right” as

  to any claim, as required by 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).

       Goncalves is advised that any motion to reconsider this ruling

  will not extend the time to file a notice of appeal in this matter.

  See Rules Governing § 2255 Cases, Rule 11(a).



  SO ORDERED.
