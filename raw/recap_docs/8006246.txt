The defendant is present in court. He is X      under custody         on bond

X     Plea of not guilty withdrawn; plea of guilty entered as to count     1      .

provide some background information.        The government has no objections to defendant being

sentence today. After listening to counsel the Court finds that it has enough information in the record

to sentence the defendant.
