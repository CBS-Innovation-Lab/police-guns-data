           DEFENDANT'S TRAVERSE TO GOVERRNMENT'S OBJECTION TO
     MOTION FOR REDUCTION OF SENTENCE PURSUANT TO 18 U.S.C. § 3582


     NOW COMES the defendant, Keith Ware, .E!.£       ~.~.,   and respectfully
submites his traverse or reply to the Government's objection(s) to
defendant's motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).                In support
and response therein, the defendant states the following:
Point One:         The Governemnt in its argument at I. page 5 purports
and distorts defendant's claim and the purpose of Amendment 599.
     They also suggest that Amendment 599 does not apply in defendant's
case since the Probation Officer calculated his offense level using
§§ 2K2.1(a)(2) and 4B1.4 of the Sentencing Guidelines.
     However, the PSR at page 5.      ~-14   disputes the governemnt's -asser-
tions and alleged calculations meant only to confuse and mislead
the Court, since the PSR as stated above assessed the defendant an
additional 4 points under specific offense characteristics for his
alleged possession and or use of the :weapon or firearm during and
in relation with another offense. See Id .•           Nothing could be further
from the truth.      What in fact the Probation Officer did was to use
        Case 1:94-cr-00069-T    Document 45    Filed 02/11/2008    Page 2 of 8



the Guideline section 2K2.1 for violation(s) of Title 18, section
922(g) offenses.        Section 2K2.1(a)(2) was used to find a base offense
if the defendant had at least two prior convictions of either a
crime of violence or serious drug offense.              Which in the present
case produced an offense level of 24,             section 2K2.1(b)(5) was used
to assess an additional 4 points under specific offense characteris-
tics.     Which is a point at issue in defendant's motion, and is in
fact an enhancement that Amendment 599 holds is improper, accordingly,
pursuant to Policy Statement, U.S.S.G.§ 181.10, which expressly
provides: that Amendment 599 may be applied retroactively in a §
3582(c)(2) proceeding.          This motion is far from being an abuse of
writ or procedural post conviction litigation.               It is in fatt -what
it states and claims to be, a motion under 3582(c)(2) not a 28 U.S.C.
§ 2255.     Let us not distort nor confuse or cloud the two independant
Statutory provisions, and the points at issue.
   Although a clarifying Amendment, Amendment 599                 in ~th~   instant .
case must be given full force and effect of what the Sentencing Com-
mission meant at the time of the defendant's sentence. ; Concededly,
a clarifying Amendment "changes nothing concerning the legal effect
of the Guidelines ," but claifies what the Commission deemed the
Guidelines to have already meant.             Thus, the defendant would be
entitled to retroactive application of Amendment 599 in its clarif-
ying effect. See u.S. v. Crudu2, 375 F~3d 5 at 9, (1st Cir. '2004)
citing    U.~~__~.   Goin~~,   357 F.3d 469, 474 (4th Gir. 2004).

defendant attempting to suggest that Amendment 599 to the United
States Sentencing Guidelines effective November 1, 2000 was imperm-
issable double counting.         However, what the issue and question for
the Court is whether Amendment 599 would have prevented the weapon
enhancement the defendant received on his section 922(g) conviction.
    Accordingly, under the text -of .Amendment 599, defendant Ware's
enhancement falls within the gap between Amendment0599's restrictions
that barred defendant's sentence enhancement.              G~i~~~     Id. at 481 I.
This position has nothing to do with impermissable double counting
but wi th principles of «expressio unius est exclusio alterius))" applying
with full force to interpretation of sentencing guidelines                      U~it~q

   Similarly~      the   Government~s   argument Point II      is ~completely             in
error and misplaced, to suggest that his claim(s) are moot, defies
all logic.      It is clear that defendant sentence was imposed by the
use of the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual effective
November 1, 1994 to calculate his sentence.              However, that assesment
was short lived by the United States Sentencing Commission, who by
"Congressional authori ty were given the unusual expl ici t power to
decide whether and to what extent its amendments reducing sentences
will be given retroactive effect." See         ~~~.t0.E__~.:....PE_i_t~..§_t:..~.!~_l!,        500
U.S. 344, 111 S.Ct. 1854, 114 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991)                 It is the defend-
ant's assertion that his judgement may         berevi~ed         through the endowed
btoad ~po~ers :   Congress authorized the    Commissio~·to gi~e -retroa~tive

application of guideline anendments.          In this instRnt case Amendment
599.
   The government further purports to claim that defendant's claims
are moot because the defendant was alleged to have had three prior
convictions for crimes of violence, which made him subject to enhan-
cement under the Armed Career Criminal Act ("ACCA"), 18 U.S.C.§ 924(e).
Which according to U.S.S.G. § 4B1.4 of the Sentencing Manual, the
applicable level for a defendant who possessed a firearm, and had
been found guilty of possessing in connection with a crime of violence,
is level thirty-four (34).
   Here~   the government again purports and makes assertions absent
any evidence that the defendant even met the statutory requirement,
never mind the guideline section application to determine that one of
the prior-.convictions-'re li eeL upon cons t i tuted a violen t crime under 481.4
unquestionably, the Presentence Investigation Report states:
           "No details of" offense were contained in the Court
           f i Ie." See 1.9.. .F s_g...E..~g.~_~.~_:l~, .
   The government in this case and this regard failed to establish
even by a deminimus effect a preponderance of eveidence              the ~existance

of the prior, according to the Probation Office there was :no ' de t a i l s
of the alleged offense, neither was there presented evidence upon
which the Court could rely on to determine the nature of the alleged
prior conviction and its authority to make a factual finding.                 This
absence and passing of judgement in the face of a presentence report
that is riddled with erroneous information or lacktherof was a crit-

ical error of law.              In the present case there was presented no
information in relation to all three (3) priors which on thier face
clearly demonstrated that the prior convictions were valid or that
the defendant         ~as    represented by counsel, to satisfy the requisites

Ct. 255 19 L.Ed.2d 319 (1963), as is the case here, unquestionably
a Federal PSR could not satisfy either of the above predicates.
     Consequently, that is effectively what took plcae in this instant
case. See      !i_!s~   Y!li t~_Uta t!!~~ v.          TUE.b~de~Leol].~!"_~2.,    468 F. 3d 34,39
(1st Cir. 2006)("[A] presentence report in a subsequent case ordin-
arily may not be used to prove the details of the offense 'conduct'
that underlies a prior conviction.                         Notably, "a district court is
not permitted to rely upon a PSR's cahracterization of a defendant's
prior offense for enhancement purposes." Neither can the government
presume the priors to have been valid ..~~_~.~~                           .~~~.'    see also   ~~~~e~

     Moreover, this Court must ultimately correct the error of applying
the enhancement during defendant Ware's original sentencing.                                   this
is so, since Amendment 599 had no effect on the Court's ability to
apply such enhancements as the ones the defendant receinved on his
Section 922(g) conviction, application of the enhancement in this
case would have made such contrary to Note two (2) as properly con-

structed, both before and after the enactment of Amendment 599. See
.Qoi~,    357 F.3d at 480, holding that, "a defendant may rely on a
clarifying or hybrid amendment to support a § 3582(c)(2) motion, so
long as the amendment has been designed for retroactive application
of a sentencing range lower than the range applied at the original
sentencing proceeding.        Furthermore, "the disruption of finality
engendered by broad interpretation of section 3582(c)(2) is consis-
tent with legislative design," which anticipates that sentences will
be   reo~ened   whenever a guideline amendment is given retroactive
effect.) Id .•     In fact nothing in the statutory language indicates
or requires that the guideline amendment actually have the effect
of lowering a defendant's guideline range before the sentencing
court can revisit the sentence.        Rather, the Cstatute .r e qui r e s that
the defendant' s s cn t enc e was "based on" a sentencing range that has
subsequently been lowered.        All Firearm sentences were "based on"
weapons guideline's sentencing ranges because those ranges repres-
ented the starting points of every sentencing pre-and post Booker,
even if the defendant was ultimately sentenced under §§ 4B1.1 or
4B1.4. See Gall v. United States, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591 at-596 (2007),
("[A] district court should begin all proceedings by correctly cal-
culating the applicable guideline range ... the guideline should be
the starting point and the initial bench mark.            But are not and should
not be the only consideration, however, [T]he judge should then con-
sider allof the section 3553(a) factors to determine whether they
support the sentence requested by a party.)~empahsis added). 9~1~,

    In addition, § 3582(c)(2)       " requlres       . courts to cons-
                                          . " sentenclng
ider allapllicable sections         3553 factors.        The Supreme Court said
that "the extent of the difference of particular sentence and the
recommended guideline range is surely relevant" to a sentencing
decision. Gall Id.        Given this relevance, this court is free under
§ 3582(c)(2) to consider the clarifying or hybrid amendment 599 to

support defendant's 3582 motion since this amndment has been desig-
nated for retroactive application, and would result in the applic-
ation of a sentencing range lower than the range applied at the or-
iginal sentencing proceeding. 18 U.S.C.A. § 3582(a)(West 2000),
sentence reduction warranted.
    Accordingly,    ~irice ~ame~dment   599 became effective on November 1,
2000, with retroactive application, this Court must and should vac-
