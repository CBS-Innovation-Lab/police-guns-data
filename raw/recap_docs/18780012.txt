                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE




United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 06-cr-25-01-PB

Brandon Deane

                                  O R D E R


     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

July 6, 2006 trial in the above case, citing the need for

additional time to complete discovery and prepare for trial.

The government does not object to a continuance of the trial

date.

     Accordingly, in order to allow the parties additional time

to properly prepare for trial, the court will continue the trial

from July 6, 2006 to October 3, 2006.          In agreeing to continue

the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ยง

3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the ends of

justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the best

interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
