                  GOVERNMENT’S SENTENCING MEMORANDUM

     The government is submitting this memorandum to set forth

the basis on which it is asking the Court to accept the plea

agreement that has been tendered pursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(C).

That agreement calls for a sentence of 72 months and an

additional period of supervised release of 3 years.

     The government believes that the agreed-upon disposition is

an appropriate one that reflects the seriousness of the instant

offense, the increasing gravity of the defendant’s crimes since

the age of 17, and his youth.     The government also believes that

the sentence should include various conditions of supervised

release including the requirement that the defendant stay out of

Boston while on supervised release and that he be required to

spend the first six months of supervised release in a halfway

house outside Boston.    These conditions are discussed below.

     1.   The recommended sentence

     The defendant is a 19-year old resident of Jamaica Plain,

Massachusetts.    Despite his age, he already qualifies as a career

offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. §4B1.1. See PSR at ¶¶33, 36.

                                     1
       Case 1:08-cr-10026-MLW Document 17 Filed 06/08/08 Page 2 of 14



       The defendant’s career offender predicates are both

convictions that result from crack cocaine distribution in and

around the Bromley-Heath Housing Project (“the Project”) where

the defendant grew up and has repeatedly gotten into serious

trouble.   On January 4, 2007, the defendant was charged with

Distribution of a Class B Substance in Roxbury District Court.

PSR at ¶33.    That case arose out of a series of controlled

purchases of crack cocaine made to a cooperating witness working

for the FBI in a federal investigation.        Id.   Because the

defendant was 17 years old at the time (and was therefore a

juvenile at the time of these offenses under federal law), he was

charged in state court.      He was, however, charged as an adult.

       This first case was resolved on March 27, 2007.         The

defendant admitted to sufficient facts and the case was continued

without a finding until 3/26/09.         Id. (hereinafter “drug

trafficking conviction 1").      It was therefore a scoreable offense

under the Sentencing Guidelines even if the defendant hadn’t

thereafter violated the terms of his probation.          See U.S.S.G.

§4A1.2(f).

       The defendant was charged with another drug trafficking

charge on June 6, 2007 (approximately three months later, while

he was on probation for drug trafficking conviction 1).           PSR at

¶36.   Like its predecessor, this case also arose out of the

defendant’s efforts to distribute crack cocaine at Bromley-Heath.

        Case 1:08-cr-10026-MLW Document 17 Filed 06/08/08 Page 3 of 14



The defendant was approached by the Boston Police because he had

been trespassed out of the Project. Id.         After being placed under

arrest for trespassing, officers recovered 16 bags of crack

cocaine, some marijuana, and $72 in cash from the defendant.              Id.

        This arrest also resulted in a conviction for drug

trafficking (“drug distribution conviction 2").           On August 1,

2008, the defendant was sentenced to 2 years in prison, with 6

months to be served and the balance suspended until August 1,

2009.    PSR at ¶36.    At the same, time his probation was revoked

on drug trafficking conviction 1 and he was sentenced to six

months on that case because of his probation violation there.

        The defendant was released from prison on 11/14/07.         The

conduct giving rise to the offense of conviction arose only six

weeks later.     This time, the defendant was in possession of not

only 14 bags of crack cocaine but a loaded firearm as well.              PSR

at ¶13.

        If the defendant were held accountable for the drugs found

at the time of his arrest (which are believed to have been

possessed for distribution purposes given the defendant’s recent

acknowledgment that he is not a crack cocaine user (see PSR at

¶¶66-69), his guideline range with a plea would be 188-235

months.    U.S.S.G. §4B1.1(b)(B).      If he were held accountable for

the drugs on the gun offense, the guideline range would be 100-

125 months.     PSR at ¶85.

     The government is recommending a sentence of 72 months to be

followed by 3 years of supervised release with the conditions

discussed below.       It does so in deference to the defendant’s age

and in the hope that six years of prison along with a program of

close supervision upon his release (consistent with the

recommendations set forth below) will help to convince the

defendant to change his ways and thereby avoid spending much of

the rest of his adult life in prison.1

     2.     The defendant should be ordered out of the city of
            Boston while on supervised release

     A critical component of the overall sentence the government

is recommending is that the defendant be ordered to stay outside

Boston while he is on supervised release.           The government

believes that it is critical for the Court to order the defendant

to stay out of Boston while on supervised release except on

holidays or other special occasions when he may be expressly

permitted by his Probation Officer to visit during daylight

hours.     The purpose of this restriction is to keep the defendant

in a new environment where there will be fewer opportunities to


     1
        The defendant is prepared to plea guilty to an
information charging him with possession of both the gun and the
ammunition it contained. The case was originally charged as only
an ammunition case because trace information had not been
received that was needed to establish the required nexus between
the firearm and interstate commerce. By having the defendant
plead to the firearm as well (now that this information has been
received), the government is ensuring that he will face a stiffer
sentence in state or federal court should he commit any
additional crime of a similar nature after he is released.

                                       4
     Case 1:08-cr-10026-MLW Document 17 Filed 06/08/08 Page 5 of 14



commit crime and where the defendant will be able to focus on

other rehabilitative efforts that the government is recommending

he be required to make. See Cullen, “Environmental Corrections –

A New Paradigm for Effective Probation and Parole Supervision,”

66 Federal Probation 2, 28-37 (Sept. 2002) (“[t]he effectiveness

of probation and parole supervision will be increased to the

extent that officers systematically. . .reduce the extent to

which offenders are tempted by and come into contact with

opportunities for crime”).

     The Court’s power to impose such a condition is clear.

Under 18 U.S.C. §3583(d), the court is directed to impose certain

mandatory conditions of release and may authorize “any other

condition it considers appropriate.”      The only constraint on this

authority is that the conditions be reasonably related to the

criteria set out in § 3553 –nature/circumstances of the offense,

history/characteristics of the defendant, the seriousness of the

offense, need for future deterrence/public protection, and need

to rehabilitate the defendant.

      The Court need look no further than the text of section

 3583 to conclude that the requested geographic restriction is

 proper.   Section 3583(d) specifically authorizes a sentencing

 court to impose as a condition of supervised release any

 permissive condition set forth in section 3563(b)(1)-(10) or

 3563(b)(12)-(20). Those provisions specifically allow a


                                 5
     Case 1:08-cr-10026-MLW Document 17 Filed 06/08/08 Page 6 of 14



 sentencing court to require a defendant to “refrain from

 frequenting specified kinds of places or from associating

 unnecessarily with specified persons,” to “reside in a

 specified place or area, or refrain from residing in a

 specified place or area,” or “remain in the jurisdiction of the

 court, unless granted permission to leave by the court or a

 probation officer.”

    These restrictions simply make sense in this case where

much of the troubles that the defendant has experienced are

specifically related to the areas in which he has spent his time.

The government therefore seeks a condition that would keep him

out of that very same environment. This is particularly

appropriate here where the record shows evidence of the

defendant’s repeated commission of crime in Bromley-Heath and

other areas of the city and his association with known gang

members from the Heath Street area.      See Exhibit 1 (BPD Field

Interrogation Observation Reports regarding defendant’s Heath

Street Gang association). See generally Olson et al, “The

Relationship Between Gang Membership and Inmate Recidivism,”

Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority Research Bulletin

(May 2004) (concluding that gang members had significantly higher

recidivism rates than non-gang members); Federal Judicial Center,

“Special Need Offenders Bulletin-Prison Gangs” (October,

1997)(same).2      See also PSR at ¶59 (detailing unsuccessful

efforts of defendant’s mother to “shelter him from outside

influences of his peers in the Bromley-Heath Development”).

     There is also ample basis in the cases for the proposed

condition.      In United States v. Smith, 436 F.3d 307 (1st Cir.

2006), the First Circuit upheld a supervised release condition

imposed by this Court that barred a defendant from seeing his

young daughter.3      Although the defendant argued that the

condition violated his fundamental right to associate with his



     2
        The Heath Street/H-Bloc dispute produced one of the most
tragic murders in recent years. On November 28, 2006, Jamhol
Norfleet was murdered outside his Holworthy Street residence.
Norfleet was a leader of the H-Bloc Gang. Jamhol Norfleet was
also a participant in ongoing truce discussions between Holworthy
and Heath Street that were at one time secret but had been
publicized in newspaper articles published several weeks earlier.
See Boston Globe, “Two Gangs Find Real Peace in Secret” (November
5, 2006). Norfleet’s murder also occurred on the anniversary
date of the murder of a Heath Street associate Carl Searcy in
2005. The defendant has repeatedly been FIO’d in the company of
members of the Searcy family. See Exhibit 1.

     The government does not allege that the defendant had
anything to do with this murder. The government does believe,
however, that it shows the need for the relief sought in this
case for the people in this area of the city and the need to
protect the defendant from himself.
     3
        No such condition is requested in this case. The
government is simply seeking to keep the defendant out of Boston
subject to specific exceptions his probation officer may make
permitting visits to family members during daylight hours on
holidays and other special occasions. The government also notes
that the defendant’s mother is hoping to move to the Malden area
to be closer to her mother, which move would further facilitate
the defendant’s reintegration to society outside the city of
boston upon his release from prison. PSR at ¶61.

child, the Court responded that “those who are convicted of

crimes against society lose a measure of constitutional

protection” and thus “a sentencing court can infringe upon a

convicted felon’s liberty in various ways.”       Id. at 310.    The

Court held that a sentencing court could ask the defendant “to

refrain from frequenting specified kinds of places or from

associating unnecessarily with specified persons” and that the

instant condition fell into this permissible category.         Id. at

311 (citing § 3563(b)(6)).    The Court further held that the

instant condition satisfied the permissible sentencing goal of

protecting the public.

     While Smith did not involve a geographical restriction of

the type sought here, other decisions have.       At least three

federal courts of appeal have upheld geographic restrictions as a

condition of probation or supervised release when the restriction

served as a deterrent to protect the victimized community and/or

rehabilitate the defendant.    See United States v. Cothran, 855

F.2d 749 (11th Cir. 1988) (validating a probation restriction

that prevented defendant, convicted of cocaine distribution to

minors, from traveling to Fulton County, Georgia because his

return to a high-crime neighborhood in southeast Atlanta would

likely result in his continued criminal activity and the

endangerment of neighborhood youth); United States v. Sicher, 239

F.3d 289, 292 (3d Cir. 2000) (upholding a supervised release

restriction, after various drug convictions, that covered two

counties in the Allentown, Pennsylvania area because the

“territorial limitation [was] clearly intended to promote

rehabilitation by keeping [defendant] away from the influences

that would most likely cause her to engage in further criminal

activity”).      See also United States v. Alexander, 509 F.3d 253

(6th Cir. 2007) (affirming condition of supervised release that

required defendant to live in city several hundred miles away

from family for first 12 months of supervised release; court

noted that condition: (a) “will further [defendant’s]

rehabilitation efforts by temporarily removing him from the

destructive influences that have plagued him;” and (b) “holds the

potential to protect the community from future crimes as well”).4


     4
        Appellate courts from at least twelve states have also
upheld geographic restrictions as a condition of probation or
parole when the restriction served as a deterrent to protect a
victimized community and/or rehabilitate a defendant. See
Beavers v. State, 666 So. 2d 868 (Ala. Crim. App. 1995)
(upholding parolee’s exclusion from a county because he had
committed nine felonies in that county and the restriction would
help prevent recidivism – rule does not apply to probationers);

App. 1982) (upholding probationer’s exclusion from a red-light
district of Anchorage to prevent her from engaging in further
prostitution); Larson v. State, 572 So. 2d 1368 (Fla. 1991)
(upholding probationer’s exclusion from Tallahassee to prevent
further witness tampering); Baker v. State, 609 So. 2d 167 (Fla.
Dist. Ct. App. 1992) (upholding probationer’s exclusion from a
neighborhood in Tampa Bay after conviction for burglary and
assault/battery); Collett v. State, 206 S.E. 2d 70 (Ga. Ct. App.
1974), rev’d 208 S.E.2d 472 (Ga. 1974) (invalidating
probationer’s exclusion from seven counties in the Atlanta
metropolitan area, after drug abuse conviction, to remove him
from the temptation of narcotics – exclusion later upheld by the

     Courts upholding such conditions have given weight to the

fact that the challenged conditions permitted the defendant to

return to the restricted area with the permission of a probation

officer.   See Sicher, 239 F.3d at 292 (The “prohibition is not

absolute, however, because she can enter either county with the

permission of her probation officer. . .. .        These minor

not wholly disastrous, influences”).      See also, Cothran, 855 F2d

at 752.    The Eleventh Circuit also relied on the language of the

current federal probation statute, now 18 U.S.C. § 3563(b)(13).

See Id. at 753 (“Congress has recently chosen to empower federal

courts with the authority to require a probationer to ‘reside in

a specific place or area, or refrain from residing in a specific

place or area’” suggesting “that the district court’s challenged

condition of probation is simply not contrary to public

policy”).5

     The government is seeking a restriction in this case from

all of Boston rather than only the Bromley-Heath Housing Project.

It does so because the defendant’s documented criminal activity

was not limited to Bromley-Heath and because the defendant so

brazenly and repeatedly prior orders that he stay out of the

Project.     See PSR at ¶34, 35, 36(trespass or other violations).

See also Exhibit 2.     The government notes that exactly this type

of restriction has been ordered against other Bromley-Heath

residents who, like the defendant, sold drugs at Bromley-Heath in

violation of a BHA “No Trespass Order” and had serious criminal

records.     See United States v. Carrasquillo, Criminal No. 06-



     5
       The condition the government is proposing here would allow
modification once the defendant is released and would permit the
defendant’s probation officer to allow the defendant access to
Suffolk County on holidays and other special occasions to see
family members during daylight hours if in fact those family
members remain in Bromley-Heath.

10320 (Young, J.)(comparable defendants excluded from Suffolk

County for full periods of supervised release of up to 12

years).6      See also United States v. Tom, 2007 WL 2822908 (1st Cir.

2007)(“Post-Booker, there remains a strong interest in national

uniformity among defendants who commit the same crimes and are

similarly situated.”).

     3.       Other recommended Conditions of Supervised Release

     The government is also recommending the following additional

conditions be imposed as part of the overall Judgement of

conviction in this case:

         A.   First Six Months of Supervised Release should be served

in a Halfway House Outside of Boston.         The government recognizes

that the geographic exclusion will keep the defendant away from

some family contact and much that is familiar to him.         To some

extent, that is the point.      In order to alleviate the disruption

that this will cause and help the defendant re-integrate back

into society upon his release, his first six months of supervised

release should be spent in a halfway house outside of Boston and

the defendant should be required to comply with all of the terms

and conditions of that facility.         There is presently such a

facility in Lawrence, Massachusetts.



     6
        Amos Carrasquillo, one of the defendants in the
referenced case, is listed in a number of the attached FIO’s as
being in the company of the defendant. See Exhibit 1.

     Case 1:08-cr-10026-MLW Document 17 Filed 06/08/08 Page 13 of 14



     B.   Continued Education.    The defendant should be required

to obtain his GED while on Supervised Release (if he has not

obtained it in Prison) and to attend any and all available job

training as direct by Probation.        See PSR at ¶¶72 (defendant

hopes to obtain GED and vocational training in plumbing or

painting).

     C.   Employment.   The defendant should be required to seek

and maintain employment while on Supervised Release.         See PSR at

¶73 (“the defendant is a young man with no history of stable

employment”).

     D.   Other conditions. The forgoing recommended conditions

are in addition to others (such as drug treatment and counseling,

mental health treatment and counseling to the extent the Court or

probation considers it to be appropriate) that the court would

normally impose in a case of this nature.
