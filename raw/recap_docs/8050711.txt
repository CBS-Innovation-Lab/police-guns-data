____________________________________________________________________________


MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF OBJECTION TO REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION

       Hommy Acevedo objects to the recommended sentence of 3 months for his violation of
probation. The Court imposed the special conditions of mental health and substance abuse
counseling as part of Mr. Acevedo’s sentence in order to help assure his successful rehabilitation.
Despite the fact that these conditions did not relate back to his conviction, his failures in treatment
are now the basis for the present prison recommendation. The Court credit Mr. Acevedo for not
committing any new crimes and for the successful strides he has made while on probation, and
fashion a violation sentence which allows him to continue his counseling.


I.     Travel of the Case
       This Court sentenced Mr. Acevedo on April 13, 2007, to a three year probationary term for
convictions on three counts of false statements in firearms purchase applications. The first 6 months
of the sentence was served by Mr. Acevedo in home confinement. This Court imposed the extra
conditions of mental health and substance abuse counseling on Mr. Acevedo’s sentence.
       In November, 2007, Mr. Acevedo appeared before Magistrate Judge Martin on an allegation
that he had violated the terms of his probation by not fully complying with his counseling and testing
positive for controlled substances. Mr. Acevedo admitted the violations and continued on probation
pending sentencing. Mr. Acevedo appeared again in April, 2008, for an additional violation (non-
compliance with treatment and testing positive for controlled substances) and again continued on
probation pending sentencing. Judge Martin continued Mr. Acevedo’s sentencing each time based


                                                   1
      Case 1:06-cr-00145-ML-DLM           Document 19         Filed 08/21/2008       Page 3 of 8



on his hope that Mr. Acevedo would be able to correct his behavior and also in acknowledgment of
Mr. Acevedo’s successes including obtaining employment and caring for his daughter. He was not,
however, completely successful and after further missteps appeared before Judge Martin on August
5, 2008, for the final violation hearing. Magistrate Judge Martin’s report recommending 3 months
of incarceration followed that hearing.


II.     Individual Considerations
        Pursuant to the initial sentencing in this matter, Mr. Acevedo gave an interview to the
probation department and assisted them in his pre-sentence investigation. The resulting pre-sentence
report (“PSR”) was produced to the Court for consideration in sentencing.
        The report detailed Hommy Acevedo’s life and upbringing. He comes from a close-knit
family of Puerto Rican descent. His parents showed him love and gave him support, and continue
to support him today. Unfortunately, they were not able to give him the attention that he needed as
a youth due to the significant, and ultimately fatal, health problems of Hommy’s younger brother.
His brother’s illness demanded his parents’ time and focus. The lack of attention for Hommy
predictably led to his attraction to the wrong crowd, the use of marijuana, and educational failure.
It also manifested itself in significant mental health concerns wherein Hommy exhibited self-
mutilating and suicidal tendencies.
        Despite these problems during his teens, Mr. Acevedo had fairly well righted his life in his
20's. He has been consistently employed his entire adult life. He earned his GED on his own in
2005. He has been able to contribute significantly to the care of his infant daughter. While it is true
that he has continued to use marijuana, that has not significantly impeded his productivity. The sole
black mark on his resume is this conviction.
        After considering this information, all provided in the PSR, the Court chose to add the
additional probation conditions of substance abuse and mental health counseling. Neither of these
issues played a role in Mr. Acevedo’s commission of his offenses of conviction, but certainly could
assist in Mr. Acevedo’s complete rehabilitation. Rehabilitation is, of course, an important factor to
be considered in sentencing. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2).
        Since his sentencing, Mr. Acevedo has been successful in many aspects of his probation. He


                                                  2
    Case 1:06-cr-00145-ML-DLM              Document 19         Filed 08/21/2008        Page 4 of 8



completed six months in home confinement. He has established himself as a trusted employee. He
has been able to purchase a car, and, again, plays a significant role in the care of his daughter. The
Court should also know that Mr. Acevedo split from his girlfriend (they had been living together
with their daughter) and this breakup has caused him considerable stress on top of his other
responsibilities. In his report, Judge Martin referred to the large size of Mr. Acevedo’s court file in
a negative light. That size likely corresponds to the very close scrutiny of Mr. Acevedo’s drug and
mental health treatment difficulties. It does not reflect, however, all of the success Mr. Acevedo has
demonstrated during his probation; most particularly his lack of criminal conduct.
        This Court knows that substance abuse and mental health problems very often closely relate
to one another, and that defeating or controlling one’s demons may be the most difficult part of a
persons rehabilitation. Mr. Acevedo has these problems and has suffered repeated setbacks; the
Court should expect further setbacks in the future because it is the nature of recovery. The Court
imposed the conditions of counseling to help Mr. Acevedo. These problems had no connection to
his crimes. The Court should applaud the fact that he has not committed any new crimes, and not
use his counseling failures to now place him in prison.
        Mr. Acevedo has tried to succeed in counseling. He has gone to sessions and changed
providers in order to fit his work and his counseling into his schedule. Robert Marshall, Mr.
Acevedo’s counselor from Gateway Healthcare, confirms in his August 5, 2008, letter that Hommy
has made honest efforts to participate in counseling since he started with Gateway in April, 2008.
He indicates that he set goals for treatment with Mr. Acevedo, but they have not yet been met.
Additionally, he states that Mr. Acevedo continues to exhibit behavior that is self destructive to the
extent that it could have negative effects on his probationary status. The Court should consider Mr.
Marshall’s comments in the context in which they are made. The counselor-client relationship here
is atypical in that: 1) a third party, the probation department, is paying for the treatment; 2) the third
party has access to all of the information involved with and gleaned from the counseling; and 3) the
counseling is Court ordered.1 This relationship plainly impacts the success of the counseling because
the client knows that everything done is subject to review by his probation officer and, possibly, by


        1
          A typical counselor-client relationship is one of strict confidentiality that is sought out
by the client.

the Court and attorneys. The counseling process is therefore more strained. Mr. Marshall recognizes
that Hommy needs help, they identify the problems, and they work on tactics to overcome those
problems. The Court should find troubling, however, that Mr. Marshall somehow expected Mr.
Acevedo to have succeeded in conquering his issues after three and one-half months of treatment.
That is not a realistic goal. The Court will recall that Mr. Acevedo has a history self harm and that
Mr. Marshall has identified continuing destructive behavior. Mr. Marshall ought to focus on the
source of this behavior rather than prematurely declaring Mr. Acevedo a failure. Mr. Acevedo is
committed to the counseling and it should be allowed to continue.


III.     Sentencing Considerations
         A.     General
         Sentencing, even in the context of probation violations, is governed by 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).
See 18 U.S.C. § 3565(a). The statute directs the Court to impose a sentence “sufficient, but not
greater than necessary” to comply with the purposes of sentencing. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). Those
purposes include providing just punishment, creating general and specific deterrence, incapacitating
the defendant, and rehabilitating the defendant. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2). In order to effect these
purposes the Court must consider an array of general and specific items of relevant information.
         The specific information predictably pertains to the defendant and his particular
circumstances. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1). The Court must consider the unique facts surrounding the
charges upon which the defendant will be sentenced as well as his individual characteristics. The
general information for consideration includes the types of sentences available and the advisory
guideline range2. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(4) & (5). The district judge then uses all of the compiled
information when determining the appropriate sentence.
         The sentencing process includes the calculation of the advisory guideline range and the
weighing of relevant information affecting sentencing factors under § 3553(a). See Gall v. United
States, 552 U.S. ___, 2007 U.S. LEXIS 13083, ***20-21 (2007) (following Rita v. United States,
551 U.S. ___, 2007 U.S. LEXIS 8269 (2007)). The district court must consider all of that


         2
          The United States Sentencing Guidelines rendered advisory, not mandatory, by United
States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005).

                                                  4
   Case 1:06-cr-00145-ML-DLM             Document 19        Filed 08/21/2008       Page 6 of 8



information, make an individualized assessment of the information, decide whether the information
supports the sentence requested by either party, and decide the appropriate length of the sentence.
Gall, 2007 U.S. LEXIS 13083, at ***21. The sentencing court must “calculate the advisory
sentencing guideline range accurately, so that they can derive whatever insight the guidelines have
to offer, but ultimately they must sentence based on 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) without a thumb on the
scale favoring a guideline sentence.” United States v. Sachsenmaier, 491 F.3d 680, 685 (7th Cir.
2007) (interpreting Rita). The respect and considerate weight due for the suggested guideline range
is born from the Sentencing Commission’s production of certain guidelines based on empirical study
and review of past practice. See United States v. Smith, 445 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2006). Not all
guidelines, however, are based on such data and sentencing courts are therefore free to disagree with
suggested guideline ranges on pure policy grounds. Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U.S. ___, 2007
U.S. LEXIS 13082, ***31-32 (2007).
       Section 7B of the advisory sentencing guidelines governs recommendations for violations
of probationary terms. This section is comprised of policy statements, not guidelines based on
empirical data and past practice, and therefore do not carry any presumptive weight. In this instance
Mr. Acevedo admitted to not complying with the terms of his probation, as opposed to committing
a new crime. The violation is therefore a Grade C violation. U.S.S.G. § 7B1.1. Combined with Mr.
Acevedo’s criminal history category of I, the guidelines recommend a sentence of 3 to 9 months in
prison. U.S.S.G. § 7B1.4.


       B.      Magistrate Judge Martin’s Recommendation
       Judge Martin’s recommendation, on its face, appears reasonable because it is a short period
of time and it reflects the low end of the advisory guideline range. The recommended time period,
however, does not adequately relate back to the purposes of sentencing. Judge Martin’s basis
appears to be general deterrence and promoting respect for the law. Judge Martin states that the
Court had given Mr. Acevedo many opportunities to comply with the conditions of his probation,
and given him many warnings about possible punishments if he was not successful in his mental
health and drug treatment. Ultimately Mr. Acevedo was not successful and Judge Martin concluded
that the warnings had little effect. Judge Martin also supposed a possible effect of Mr. Acevedo’s


                                                 5
   Case 1:06-cr-00145-ML-DLM             Document 19         Filed 08/21/2008       Page 7 of 8



lack of compliance resulting in the lack of compliance by other probationers and supervisees. While
Judge Martin’s recommendation is grounded in acceptable reasons under § 3553(a), it nevertheless
results in an unreasonable sentence in this instance by not giving sufficient weight to other factors.


       C.      The Minimally Sufficient Sentence
       The Court must impose a parsimonious sentence supporting the purposes of sentencing: just
punishment, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). Other than
attempting to promote respect for the law through bare incarceration, Judge Martin’s
recommendation fails to address all of these concerns.
       Mr. Acevedo does not present any danger to the community. Incapacitation for the public’s
protection is therefore not a valid reason for this sentence. Likewise, the specter of Mr. Acevedo’s
violation proceedings influencing the conduct of someone else cannot support this sentence. Also,
based on the psychologist’s recognition of, and Mr. Acevedo’s history of, self destructive behavior,
it cannot be argued with any certainty that a prison sentence will act to specifically deter Mr.
Acevedo from future violative behavior.
       The most important consideration, however, must be the effect of a prison sentence on
Hommy’s rehabilitation. The Court imposed these counseling conditions to ensure a successful
rehabilitation though these issues did not relate to the crime of conviction. Judge Martin
recommends a 3 months sentence because Mr. Acevedo has not been fully compliant with
counseling. It is fairly apparent, however, that he is engaged with counseling and is attempting to
change his life; he has simply fallen short of success. The proposed sentence will not support Mr.
Acevedo’s attempts of rehabilitation at all. With a sentence of this length he will be sent to serve
the time at the Wyatt facility in Central Falls. The Wyatt facility does not provide any substantive
drug counseling or mental health treatment because it is a detention facility not a correctional
institution. In the very slim possibility that Mr. Acevedo lands in BOP run prison, the Court must
understand that he will not be in the system long enough to receive any treatment. Essentially, the
recommended sentence will completely remove Mr. Acevedo from the treatment that all of the
parties agree he needs and that the Court has ordered he participate in. The recommend prison
sentence presents Mr. Acevedo with a classic “Catch 22" situation: for not doing counseling you go


                                                  6

to prison where we can assure your non-compliance.


V.     Conclusion
       This Court must determine the appropriate violation sentence just as it does in substantive
sentencing; a sentence that is sufficient but not greater than necessary, by incorporating all of the
considerations under § 3553(a). Here, the overwhelming consideration must be placed on Mr.
Acevedo’s rehabilitation. He has violated the probation conditions which directly impact his future
success. In response the Court has a recommendation of prison which will ensure that he does not
receive the Court ordered treatment. Mr. Acevedo’s treatment must trump the other sentencing
considerations at this time under these circumstances. The Court must fashion a violation sentence
here which allows Mr. Acevedo to remain in the community, remain employed, and remain engaged
in counseling.
