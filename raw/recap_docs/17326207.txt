STATEMENT OF REASONS
Vll COURT DETERMINATIONS OF RESTITUTION
A El Resiitution .\ioi Apptieabie.
B 'I`otal Amount ofRestitution:
C Restitution not ordered (Checl-t only one.): -
l E] For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under iii U.SrC. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under lB U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(A).
2 l:] For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under lB U‘S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex

issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on die sentencing process under iB U.S.C. § 3663)°.(€}(3)(5}`

3 l___l For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.SrC. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines_ restitution is not

ordered because the complication and prolongation ofthe sentencing process resulting from the fashioning ofa restitution order outweigh

the need to provide restitution to any victims under lS U S.C § 3663(a)( l )(B](ii).

4 l:l Restitution is not ordered for other reasons (Explain.)

D l:] Partial restitution is ordered for these reasons (18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)):
