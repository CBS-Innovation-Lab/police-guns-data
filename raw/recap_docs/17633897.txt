                          DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS

                                  JONATHAN MOORE
                                      Petitioner,

                                             v.

                           UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

                                       ORDER
                                      May 21, 2012
O’TOOLE, D.J.

       Whether the defendants “Motion to Reconsider Sentence” (dkt. no. 91) is

construed as a motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 or under Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of

Criminal Procedure, the only two plausible avenues of relief, the motion is untimely. See

28 U.S.C. § 2255(f) (one year); Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(a) (14 days).

       As a matter of substance, the motion also lacks merit. The defendant’s state

record included several offenses for which the maximum term of imprisonment

authorized was ten years, without reference to any enhancement for recidivism. See

Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 94C, §§ 32, 32A.

       The motion is DENIED.

       To the extent the motion is construed as a motion under § 2255, the Court

DENIES a certificate of appealability, as the issue is free from doubt.

SO ORDERED.

                                              /s/ George A. O’Toole, Jr.
                                              United States District Judge
