Re: Request for Court documents
   11-cr-129-01 SM, USA v. Lionel Cole

Dear Mr. Cole,

      I am writing in response to your letter received June 6, 2013, in which you request copies of court
documents, a sentencing transcript, and the docket sheet in this case.

        Please note that a transcript has not been prepared for the February 13, 2013 sentencing hearing.
If you would like to order a transcript, you may contact the court reporter, Sandra Bailey, at 603-225-
1454. You may also make your request to her my mail at the court’s address. I have attached an
information sheet from our website regarding transcript requests.

        As a one-time courtesy, I will send you a copy of the docket sheet in this case. For future
reference, please note that the clerk’s office does not provide free copies of court documents to members
of the public or litigants. All copy requests in this court require a prepaid fee of $.50 per page. For
copies of the judgment and plea agreement, payment of $9.50 must be tendered in the form of a certified
bank check or money order made payable to the Clerk of Court.

                                                         Sincerely,



                                                         /s/ Daniel J. Lynch
                                                         Daniel Lynch
                                                         Chief Deputy Clerk
