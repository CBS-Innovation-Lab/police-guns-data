     DEFENDANT BRANDON DELGADO’S MOTION FOR
APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL AND MOTION FOR REDUCTON
OF SENTENCE PURSUANT TO 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) AND U.S.S.G.
                § 1B1.10, AS AMENDED

      The defendant Brandon Delgado (“Delgado”) moves that undersigned
counsel, who represented him by appointment in the prior proceedings in
this case and who continues to be a member of the Criminal Justice Act
Panel, be appointed to represent him in this Motion for Reduction of
Sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) and U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10 and
Delgado further moves that his sentence be reduced.
BACKGROUND
      On June 7, 2006, Delgado pleaded guilty to 8 counts of a superseding
indictment which charged him with the substantive crimes of possessing
with intent to distribute and distributing either cocaine base or powder
cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1). Counts 1 through 3 involved
cocaine base in the aggregate amount of 6.24 grams. Counts 4 through 8
involved cocaine powder in the aggregate amount of 11.67 grams.




                                       1
 Case 1:05-cr-10176-RCL      Document 55      Filed 04/03/2008    Page 2 of 16



      Delgado was sentenced on October 4, 2006, under the then applicable
guidelines. Because Delgado’s offenses involved both cocaine base and
powder cocaine, the Probation Office calculated his guideline offense level
in accordance with the drug quantity tables found at guideline §2D1.1(c) and
the drug equivalency tables set forth in Application Note 10 of the
Commentary to §2D1.1 in effect at the time of the 2006 sentencing. Those
equivalency tables translated each gram of cocaine base into 20 kg of
marijuana and each gram of cocaine powder into 200 grams of marihuana.
Thus Delgado’s 6.24 grams of cocaine base was the equivalent of 124.8 kg
of marihuana and his 11.67 grams of powder the equivalent of 2.334 kg of
marihuana for a total marihuana equivalency of 127.134 kg. See PSR ¶ (23).
      Under the 2006 §2D1.1(c) drug quantity table, marihuana amounts of
at least 100 kg but less than 400 kg produced an offense level 26. Delgado’s
offense level was plainly driven by the cocaine base quantity and not at all
affected by the powder quantity. See PSR ¶¶ (23) and (24). Under the then
applicable guidelines, quantities of cocaine base of at least 5 grams but less
than 20 grams would also produce offense level 26. Indeed, that same
offense level, level 26, would have applied even if both the base – 6.24
grams – and the powder – 11.67 grams – had been counted as entirely
cocaine base.
      Delgado’s offense level was increased two levels beyond level 26 to
level 28 under U.S.S.G. §2D1.1(b)(1) as the result of the presence of a
firearm in the house in which he lived, PSR, ¶ (25), and then decreased 3
levels to level 25 for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to
U.S.S.G.§3E1.1(a) and (b), PSR ¶ (30). The Probation Office also
calculated Delgado’s criminal history at Category II. PSR ¶ (43). Under



                                       2
 Case 1:05-cr-10176-RCL           Document 55         Filed 04/03/2008   Page 3 of 16



the Probation Office’s calculations, the then applicable advisory guideline
range was 63 to 78 months. PSR ¶ (110).
       Delgado pleaded guilty pursuant to a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea
agreement. The plea agreement, contemplating a Category I criminal history
calculation rather than the Probation Office Category II calculation,
provided for imprisonment for a period within the range of 57 to 71
months. 1 Although the agreed upon range was encompassed within the
PSR calculated advisory range, the government recommended and the court
sentenced Delgado to a term of imprisonment of 57 months. 2
       Delgado is presently incarcerated at FCI Fairton, New Jersey, and has
a projected release date of July 14, 2009.
GOVERNING LAW
       Title 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) provides that –

           [I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of
           imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has
           subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission
           pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or
           the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the
           court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering
           the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are
           applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable
           policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.

       The Sentencing Commission amended the guidelines for crack
cocaine, effective November 1, 2007. The amendments altered the offense
levels for cocaine base offenses downward, virtually uniformly, by 2 levels.
       1
          Delgado’s criminal history points were the result of two juvenile offenses
committed when he was 16 and more than five years prior to Delgado’s federal crimes
but whose disposition occurred within the five years and an adult conviction for an
offensive assault – spitting.
       2
           There is a transcript of the sentencing hearing.

For example, the offense level for 5 to 20 grams of base which was at level
26 prior to November 1, 2007, is now level 24.
      Amended §1B1.10 of the guidelines, taking effect on March 3, 2008,
identified the cocaine base amendments, effective on November 1, 2007, as
amendments which may be applied retroactively pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §
3582(c)(2).
      The offense level under the amended guidelines for Delgado’s
offenses, before the adjustments under both U.S.S.G. §2D1.1(b)(1) and
U.S.S.G.§3E1.1(a) and (b), should be offense level 24 rather than 26, and,
after the adjustments, 23 rather than 25. However, because of a plainly
unintended anomaly in the new drug equivalency tables at Application Note
10(D)(i) of the Commentary to §2D1.1 as they apply to determining offense
levels in cases involving cocaine base and other controlled substances,
Delgado’s offense level does not appear to change.
      Had all of Delgado’s powder quantities – 11.67 grams – been counted
as cocaine base and added to his cocaine base quantity – 6.24 grams – the
total would be less than 18 grams. Under the pre-November 1, 2007
guidelines, 5 to 20 grams of base resulted in an offense level of 26. Under
the amended guidelines, 5 to 20 grams of base produce an offense level 24.
However, under the amended equivalency tables, an offense involving base
and other controlled substances involves a new equivalency table and
requires, first, a calculation of the offense level attributed to the base alone,
Application Note 10(D)(i)(I); second, a translation of that offense level and
the total amount of base into a marihuana equivalency under a new formula,
Application Note 10(D)(i)(II); and, third, a calculation that combines the
marihuana equivalency of the base with the marihuana equivalency of the
other controlled substances and then a determination of the combined base

                                         4
 Case 1:05-cr-10176-RCL      Document 55     Filed 04/03/2008    Page 5 of 16



offense level for all the controlled substances by reference to the §2D1.1(c)
drug quantity tables as they apply to marihuana quantities. Application Note
10(D)(i)(III) and (IV).
      The amended drug quantity tables did not alter the offense levels
assigned to the varying quantities of marihuana that triggered the levels for
marihuana offenses. Those triggering marihuana quantities remained
constant at each level. For example, amounts of marijuana between 100 kg
and 400 kg continued to trigger offense level 26. This is not surprising,
since the November 1, 2007 amendments were designed to lessen the
penalties for crack offenses, not marihuana offenses. It follows, however,
that if the equivalency tables were not amended, offenses involving cocaine
base and other controlled substances, no matter what the relative quantities,
would remain at the pre-November 1, 2007 offense levels.
      The drug equivalency tables were in fact amended, presumably to
ameliorate the sentences, driven by base quantities, imposed on offenses
involving base and other controlled substances. The new drug equivalency
tables – Application Note 10(D)(i) of the Commentary to §2D1.1 – are,
however, hardly perfect.
      Under the pre-November 1, 2007 drug equivalency tables one gram of
base was always counted as 20 kg of marihuana and the marihuana
quantities triggering the various offense levels corresponded perfectly with
the cocaine base quantities triggering the same offense levels. For example,
under the 2006 guidelines, base quantities between 5 and 20 grams produced
offense level 26 and under the drug equivalency tables each gram of base
translated into 20 kg of marihuana. Offense level 26 covered marihuana
quantities between 100 kg and 400 kg. Five grams of base translated



                                       5
    Case 1:05-cr-10176-RCL      Document 55        Filed 04/03/2008      Page 6 of 16



into100 kg of marihuana. Twenty grams of base translated into 400 kg of
marihuana. There was a complete symmetry in the equivalency conversion.
        Under the new drug equivalency table, the quantities of marihuana
attributed to a gram of cocaine base vary with the offense level assigned to
the quantities of base involved in the offenses of conviction. The attribution
is not progressive, but erratic. For example, if the offense level for the base
portion of the offense is level 38, the equivalency is one gram of base to 6.7
kg of marihuana. If the offense level for the base portion of the offense is
30, the equivalency is one gram of base to 14 kg of marihuana. If the
offense level for the base portion of the offense is 26, the equivalency is one
gram of base to 5 kg of marihuana. If the offense level for the base portion
of the offense is 24, the equivalency is one gram of base to 16 kg of
marihuana.
        This erratic movement of base to marihuana equivalency dependent
on base portion only offense levels appears to be designed to produce the
same kind of symmetry in the equivalency conversion that was present in the
pre-November 1, 2007 equivalency tables. But it is hardly fully successful.
For example, the new offense level 38 is matched with a 6.7 kg per base
gram equivalency. Offense level 38 applies to amounts of base at or in
excess of 4.5 kg and to amounts of marihuana at or in excess of 30,000 kg.
Forty five hundred grams of base (4.5 kg), at 6.7 kg per gram, converts to
30,150 kg of marihuana, a rough equivalence to the 30,000 kg of marihuana
which also results in an offense level 38. 3 Because this conversion is in



3
  In order for 4,500 grams of base to be precisely equivalent to 30,000 kg of marihuana
the conversion would be one gram of base to 6.666666667 kg of marihuana. The 6.7 kg
conversion factor is the result of a rounding up to one decimal place.


                                           6
 Case 1:05-cr-10176-RCL      Document 55      Filed 04/03/2008   Page 7 of 16



excess of 30,000 kg of marihuana, no defendant would be prejudiced by the
rough equivalence.
      New offense level 36 is also matched with a 6.7 kg per base gram
equivalency. Offense level 36 applies to amounts of base between 1.5 kg
and 4.5 kg and to amounts of marihuana between 10,000 kg and 30,000 kg.
Fifteen hundred grams of base (1.5 kg) at 6.7 kg per gram converts to 10,050
kg of marihuana, a rough equivalence to the low end of the marihuana
quantity range of the same offense level This low end rough equivalence in
excess of the marihuana low end quantity does not prejudice a defendant.
However, with a 6.7 kg conversion factor, 30,000 kg of marihuana – and
thus level 38 – is reached at just under 4,478 grams of base. This is a
relatively minor discrepancy, but because it is on the wrong side of the
equivalence, the discrepancy could prejudice at least a few defendants.
      New offense level 34 is matched with 6 kg per base gram
equivalency. Offense level 34 applies to amounts of base between 500
grams and 1.5 kg and to amounts of marihuana between 3000 kg and 10,000
kg. Five hundred grams of base at 6 kg per gram converts nicely into 3,000
kg of marihuana, but 1,500 grams (1.5 kg) of base at 6 kg converts into only
9,000 kg of marihuana. In this case, the full amount of base does not use up
the corresponding full amount of marihuana. The discrepancy is on the
favorable side and can not prejudice a defendant.
      Real prejudice begins to emerge at base offense levels 32, 30, and 24.
New offense level 32 is matched with 6.7 kg per base gram equivalency.
Offense level 32 applies to amounts of base between 150 grams and 500
grams and to amounts of marihuana between 1,000 kg and 3,000 kg. At the
low end of the base range, the conversion is not prejudicial, but at the high
end it is. The full high end 3,000 kg marijuana equivalency is reached at just

                                       7
    Case 1:05-cr-10176-RCL      Document 55       Filed 04/03/2008      Page 8 of 16



under 448 grams of base, i.e., at an amount of base appreciably below the
level’s high end base amount. 4
        The prejudicial discrepancy increases at level 30 and is particularly
egregious at level 24. New offense level 30 is matched with 14 kg per base
gram equivalency. Offense level 30 applies to amounts of base between 50
grams and 150 grams and to amounts of marihuana between 700 kg and
1,000 kg. At the low end of the base range, the conversion is exact and not
prejudicial. 5 At the high end, however, the possible prejudice is substantial.
The full high end 1,000 kg marijuana equivalency is reached at just under 72
grams of base. This is less than half of the high end – 150 grams – of base
to which level 30 applies. This means that an offender who is responsible
for 72 grams of base 6 and any amount of any other controlled substance
would fall into offense level 32, while an offender responsible for 149 grams
of base is accorded level 30.
        New offense level 24 is matched with 16 kg per base gram
equivalency. Offense level 24 applies to amounts of base between 5 grams
and 20 grams and to amounts of marihuana between 80 kg and 100 kg. 7 At
the low end of the base range, the conversion is exact. 8 At the high end,
however, the conversion makes no sense. In fact, the full high end 100 kg
marijuana equivalency is reached at 6.25 grams of base. This is less than
one-third of the high end – 20 grams – of base to which level 24 applies.



4
  Four hundred forty eight (448) grams of base at 6.7 kg per base gram converts to
3,001.6 kg of marihuana.
5
  Fifty (50) grams of base at 14 kg per base gram converts to 700 kg of marihuana.
6
  Seventy-two (72) grams of base at 14 per base gram converts to 1,008 kg of marihuana.
7
  New level 26 applies to amounts of base between 20 grams and 35 grams and to
amounts of marihuana between 100 kg and 400 kg.
8
  Fifty (5) grams of base at 16 kg per base gram converts to 80 kg of marihuana.


                                           8
    Case 1:05-cr-10176-RCL      Document 55        Filed 04/03/2008      Page 9 of 16



This means that an offender who is responsible for 6.25 grams of base 9 and
any amount of any other controlled substance would fall into offense level
26, while an offender responsible for 19.9 grams of base is accorded level
24.
        The arbitrariness of the new drug equivalency tables would appear to
be avoidable if the Sentencing Commission had only done some math.
Precise, though perhaps more cumbersome, formulas are certainly available
to match the equivalencies at both the low end and high ends of the
respective ranges. The bad math, however, complicates Delgado’s motion
for a reduction in his base driven sentence.
        As already noted, Delgado was held accountable for 6.24 grams of
base and 11.67 grams of powder. Under the new drug quantity tables, 6.24
grams of base falls at the low end of the 5 to 20 gram range of offense level
24. However, under the new equivalency tables, his 6.24 grams of base is
converted – at 16 kg marihuana per base gram – into 99.84 kg of marijuana
and his 11.67 grams of powder – at 200 grams of marihuana per powder
gram – is converted into slightly over 2 kg of marijuana for a combined
marihuana equivalency of just above 100 kg. This would place Delgado into
offense level 26, a placement which is undeserved and senseless. Delgado’s
base quantities and powder quantities taken together are less than 20 grams
and thus his offense level would be 24 even if we were to count his powder
as if it were base.
        A literal application of the new equivalency tables would apparently
preclude Delgado’s motion for a reduction because 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2)
applies only to defendants who have “been sentenced to a term of

9
 Six point two-five (6.25) grams of base at 16 per base gram converts to 100 kg of
marihuana.


                                           9

imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been
lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o).” A
literal application of the new equivalency tables would not alter Delgado’s
offense level or his sentencing range. But this is an irrational result in this
case. Only the presence of a small amount of powder elevates Delgado’s
offenses to a current level 26. If the powder – all 11.67 grams – had been
cocaine base, the total amount involved – 6.24 grams plus 11.67 grams or
less than 18 grams – would have resulted in a current offense level 24. The
presence of the powder, carrying a marihuana equivalent that is a fraction of
that set for cocaine base, obliterates any benefit from the new guideline.
DELGADO IS ELIGIBLE FOR A SENTENCE REDUCTION
      The legal argument that follows is an argument – virtually word for
word – fashioned by Amy Baron-Evans, National Federal Defender
Resource Counsel. 10

      A.     The Policy Statement – §1B1.10 – And the Equivalency
             Table, Insofar As they Would Bar Retroactive Relief When
             One of the Arbitrary Equivalencies Eliminates the
             Reduction In the Base offense Level, Are Invalid Because
             They Violate Their Enabling Statutes and Are Inconsistent
             With the Amended Guideline
      At least three courts have identified the problems associated with the
new equivalency table and have declined to follow it. See United States v.
Watkins, 531 F.Supp.2d 943 (E.D. Tenn. 2008); United States v. Horta, 534
F.Supp.2d 114 (D. Me. 2008); United States v. Molina, slip op., 2008 WL
544703 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 28, 2008). In these cases, however, the defendants
were being sentenced under the new guidelines for the first time and the

courts were plainly free to disregard the “advisory” guideline quantity table
that would produce an anomalous result under the Booker line of cases. At
least one court, however, has allowed a motion for a sentence reduction
under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c) where the equivalency table issue arose, See
United States v. Commer, No. 2: 99-119 (N.D. Ind. March 3, 2008). Copies
of the Order and related motion are attached as Exhibit 1. 11
       When a policy statement – such as §1B1.10, or commentary to a
guideline – such as the equivalency table set forth in §2D1.1, Application
Note 10(D)(i)(II)) – is inconsistent with a statute, the statute trumps. See
United States v. LaBonte, 520 U.S. 751, 757-58 (1997); Neal v. United
States, 516 U.S. 284, 292-95 (1996); Stinson v. United States, 508 U.S. 36,
38, 44, 45 (1993).
       Title 28 U.S.C. § 994(a)(2)(c) requires that any policy statement
implementing 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) be consistent with 18 U.S.C. §
3553(a)(2) and all other pertinent federal statutes. Title 28 U.S.C. §
991(b)(1) requires that all policy statements assure the meeting of the
purposes of sentencing as set forth in § 3553(a)(2), provide certainty and
fairness in meeting those purposes, avoid unwarranted sentencing
disparities, and reflect advancement in knowledge of human behavior.
       The policy statement, U.S.S.G. §1B1.10(a)(1)(B), insofar as it would
deny relief to Delgado by eliminating a sentence reduction through the
arbitrary, avoidable, and inequitable equivalencies in the table in § 2D1.1,
Application Note 10(D)(i)(II), is inconsistent with these statutes. The table,
as it applies to Delgado and as it applies in many though not all multi-drug
cases, is contrary to reason, contrary to empirical evidence, undermines the §

11
   As reflected in the Exhibit 1 attachment, the issue is set forth in the motion and not
specifically addressed in the order allowing the motion.

3553(a)(2) purposes, creates unwarranted disparities and manifest
unfairness. As Justice Breyer might say, the table (and the policy
statement’s purported enforcement of it) is not even a “rough
approximation” of compliance with § 3553(a)(2) because it is not based on
an “empirical approach,” is not based on consultation with the criminal
justice community, and has not yet been revised in the face of evidence that
it is irrational. See Rita v. United States, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2464-65 (2007).
       Simply put, commentary is not authoritative if it is “inconsistent with,
or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.” Stinson, supra, 508 U.S.
at 38. “If . . . commentary and the guideline it interprets are inconsistent in
that following one will result in violating the dictates of the other, the
Sentencing Reform Act itself commands compliance with the guideline.”

       B.    In the Alternative, the Policy Statement Is Merely Advisory
             and Should Not Be Followed Because the Equivalency Table
             Is Not Empirically Based and Reflects Unsound Judgment.
       Although this court can decide that Delgado is eligible for a reduction
in his sentence based on the statutory reading reflected above, there is an
alternative basis. In light of United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005),
the guidelines and policy statements are advisory. U.S.S.G. §1B1.10 is
advisory, just like any other provision of the guidelines. See United States v.
Hicks, 472 F.3d 1167, 1172-73 (9th Cir. 2007; United States v. Jones, 2007
WL 2703122 (D. Kan. Sept. 17, 2007); United States v. Forty Estremera,

WL 144825, 2 (S.D.N.Y Jan. 15, 2008). This court should, therefore, find
that the arbitrary equivalencies in the new table and the limitation in

§1B1.10(a)(2)(B) 12 “fail[] properly to reflect the § 3553(a) considerations,”
and thus “reflect an unsound judgment.” Rita, supra, at 2468. Because the
new equivalency table is not the product of “empirical data and national
experience,” the court is free to reject the policy statement’s advice to deny
relief when the erratic equivalencies are the cause of raising the guideline
range. Kimbrough v. United States, 128 S.Ct. 558, 575 (2007); Gall v.
United States, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594 n.2 (2007).

       C.     The Court Has Jurisdiction to Determine that Delgado Is
              Eligible For A Reduction Despite the apparent Preclusive
              Language of 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).
       Section 3582(c)(2) is one exception to the statutory rule that the court
may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed. See 18
U.S.C. § 3582(c). One requirement for granting a sentence reduction is that
it be “consistent with applicable policy statements” issued by the
Commission. According to the Commission’s particular policy statement
regarding the retroactive application of the November 2007 crack
amendments, an amendment that “does not have the effect of lowering the
defendant’s applicable guideline range is not consistent with this policy
statement and therefore is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).”
See U.S.S.G. §1B1.10(a)(1)(B).
       Despite the apparent mandatory nature of the limitation expressed in
§1B1.10(a)(1)(B), it is certainly not jurisdictional. “[I]t is familiar law that a
federal court always has jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction.”
United States v. Ruiz, 536 U.S. 622, 628 (2002). See also, United States v.
Mineworkers, 330 U.S. 258, 291 (1947) (the courts alone decide whether

12
   §1B1.10(a)(2)(B) provides that there should be no reduction if the November 2007
crack amendments “do not have the effect of lowering the defendant’s applicable
guideline range.”

they have jurisdiction). Moreover, only the courts, and surely not the
Commission, have the power under our constitutional structure to interpret
statutes upon which jurisdiction depends. “It is emphatically the province
and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. Those who apply
the rule to particular cases must of necessity expound and interpret that rule.
It two laws conflict with each other, the courts must decide on the operation
of each.” Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803).
      It is for the court to decide whether the Commission’s policy
statement – §1B1.10(a)(1)(B) – purporting to preclude a reduction for
Delgado based on the operation of the plainly flawed equivalency table –
Application Note 10(D)(i0(II) to §2D1.1 – conflicts with the enabling
statutes – 28 U.S.C. §§ 994(a)(2)(C) and 991(b)(1) – and if so, to decide on
the operation of each. If the policy statement violates the enabling statutes,
it is inoperative. In the words of 18 U.S.C. § 3562(c), it is not an
“applicable policy statement.” (Emphasis added). Alternatively, the court
has jurisdiction to determine whether the policy statement and the
commentary are merely advisory in light of the Supreme Court’s
interpretation of 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) and (b) in Booker and its progeny.
      The policy statement regarding retroactive application of the
November 2007 crack amendments is nothing more than an instruction for
the court in determining the merits of whether to grant a sentence reduction.
For the reasons set forth above, the instruction should not be followed when
the equivalency table is arbitrary and irrational and has the effect of
eliminating a reduction that plainly should be available.

THE REDUCTION AVAILABLE TO DELGADO
      As already noted, page 2, supra, when Delgado was sentenced in
October of 2006, the offense level attached to his base and powder offenses
was level 26. The offense level was increased two levels beyond level 26 to
level 28 under U.S.S.G. §2D1.1(b)(1) as the result of the presence of a
firearm in the house in which he lived, and then decreased 3 levels to level
25 for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G.§3E1.1(a) and (b).
For the reasons argued at some length already, the offense level attached to
Delgado’s base and powder offenses under the amended guidelines should
be level 24 rather than level 26. Adding the adjustment for the presence of a
firearm and deducting the adjustment for acceptance of responsibility,
Delgado’s post-November 2007 guideline offense level would be offense
level 23.
      When Delgado was sentenced in 2006, his advisory guideline
sentencing range at offense level 25 and criminal history Category II was 63
to 78 months. PSR ¶ (110). Delgado pleaded guilty pursuant to a Rule
11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement. The plea agreement, contemplating a Category
I criminal history calculation rather than the Probation Office category II
calculation, provided for imprisonment for a period within the range of 57 to
71 months. Although the agreed upon range was encompassed within the
PSR calculated advisory range, the government recommended and the court
sentenced Delgado to a term of imprisonment of 57 months.
      Under the amended guidelines, at offense level 23 and criminal
history category II, Delgado’s guidelines sentencing range is reduced to 51
to 63 months of imprisonment. But since Delgado received a sentence
below his advisory guideline range, he is eligible for a comparably reduced
sentence under the provisions of U.S.S.G. §1B.1.10(b)(2)(B) which provides

that “If the original term of imprisonment imposed was less than the term of
imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant at
the time of sentencing, a reduction comparably less than the amended
guideline range . . . may be appropriate.”
         Delgado submits that an appropriate reduction in his case is
approximately five (5) months less than the low end of his current guideline
range, i.e., 46 months imprisonment.
         Delgado is incarcerated at FCI Fairton, New Jersey, and has a
projected release date of July 14, 2009. If the court finds Delgado eligible
for a reduced sentence, counsel does not currently anticipate a necessity for
his presence at re-sentencing.
