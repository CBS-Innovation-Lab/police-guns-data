       A     ~     Restitution Not Applicable.

       B     Total Amount of Restitution:

       C     Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

                    o     For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.c. ยง 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
                          identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S.c. ยง 3663A(c)(3)(A).

             2      0     For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. ยง 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
                          issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims' losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
                          that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.s.c. ยง 3663A(c)(3)(B).

             3      0     For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.c. ยง 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
