VII    COURT DETERMINATIONS OF RESTITUTION

       A     ~     Restitution Not Applicable.

       B     Total Amount of Restitution:

       C     Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

                    o     For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.c. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
                          identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S.c. § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

             2      0     For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
                          issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims' losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
                          that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.s.c. § 3663A(c)(3)(B).

             3      0     For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.c. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
                          ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh
