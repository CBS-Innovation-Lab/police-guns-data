                                  RECOMMENDED DECISION

          Leonard Giroux, who is charged with possession of ammunition by a person

  previously convicted of a felony, has filed a motion to suppress statements he made to

  Probation Officer Corey Day prior to the time of his arrest on September 26, 2006.

  Giroux claims those statements were obtained in violation of his rights under the Fifth

  and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution.1 I now recommend the Court

  adopt the following proposed findings of fact and deny the motion to suppress.

                                     Proposed Findings of Fact

          Martin Magnusson, a State of Maine Probation and Parole Officer since August

  2005, was assigned duties including the supervision of Leonard Giroux, who was on state

  probation for burglary to a motor vehicle and forgery as a result of convictions in State of

  Maine Superior Court, Penobscot County, docket number CR 2004-860, on or about

  February 11, 2005. Giroux had been sentenced to 3 years, all but 1 year suspended, and 2

  years probation. P.O. Magnusson had meetings with Giroux between December 2005

  and May 20, 2006. Magnusson felt the probation went well during the first part of the


  1
           Although Giroux makes reference in paragraph two of his motion to suppress to a claimed Fourth
  Amendment violation, no argument is made based upon the Fourth Amendment and the motion does not
  seek to suppress the physical evidence seized from Giroux's residence.

  probationary period. During one of these meetings, Giroux told P.O. Magnusson that he

  (Giroux) had some archery equipment and a can of ammunition. Officer Magnusson told

  Giroux that Giroux could not possess these items and Officer Magnusson told Giroux to

  discard them. Giroux stated he would do so. Magnusson knew Giroux was seeing a

  counselor but did not know the nature of Giroux's psychological problems other than

  substance abuse problems. He knew that Giroux was taking a long list of medications

  including anti-depressants. He also knew Julie Richardson, one of Giroux's co-

  defendants in another case, had moved in with Giroux. There were no probationary

  conditions forbidding contact between the two of them and Magnusson knew little of

  Giroux's background. Magnusson did not know the details of Giroux's activities in

  Massachusetts nor anything of his criminal activities there.

         At one point in his supervision of Giroux, Magnusson gave Giroux a written

  warning because there was drug paraphernalia in Giroux’s house. In May of 2006

  Giroux stopped reporting. According to Magnusson, Giroux had failed to abide by his

  state probation conditions and failed to report as scheduled to Maine Probation and

  Parole, and a State of Maine probation violation arrest warrant was sought by Magnusson

  on September 7, 2006, based on Giroux’s failure to report and changing address without

  notification. The warrant was obtained prior to September 18, 2006. In his attempts to

  find Defendant Giroux, Officer Magnusson tried on numerous dates to contact him by

  phone, mail and personal visits. During a visit sometime in August 2006, Officer

  Magnusson noticed a “For Sale by Owner” sign on Defendant’s last known residence.

  Magnusson was concerned that Giroux was planning to leave the area. Additionally, the

  Piscataquis County Sheriff's Office was investigating Giroux as a suspect in the theft of

Case 1:07-cr-00042-JAW Document 38 Filed 10/17/07 Page 3 of 8                     PageID #: 66



  some firearms and had obtained a search warrant for the residence. Magnusson went

  with them in August 2006 to execute this warrant. Giroux was not at home at the time of

  the execution of the warrant. On September 24, 2006, an undercover call was placed to

  Defendant Giroux’s number pretending interest in the real estate up for sale and a voice-

  mail message was left. On September 25, 2006, Defendant Giroux returned that call and

  arrangements were made to meet him on his property on September 26 at 10:00 a.m.

         On September 26, 2006, Corey Day and another state probation officer, acting in

  an undercover capacity, met with Giroux at his residence in Corinth. The meeting was

  prearranged by voluntary phone message between Giroux and Day, who posed as

  someone interested in buying the hunting camp. Day and his companion presented

  themselves to Giroux as hunters who wanted to buy Giroux’s property to open a guide

  business for hunters. Giroux told Day during this meeting that he liked to shoot in the

  yard, that his neighbors sometimes hear him shooting firearms and that he usually shoots

  9mm cal. ammunition or .22 cal. ammunition. Day does not recall any other specific

  statements about hunting made by Giroux. Day made no statements offering to pay

  additional money for the property if Giroux would talk about guns or hunting nor did he

  have any specific knowledge about Giroux's mental state.

         At the conclusion of the undercover meeting, the officers arrested Giroux for state

  probation violations on the outstanding probation violation arrest warrant. Day attempted

  to make the arrest as quickly as possible, but also wanted to make sure about the safety

  and security of the officers involved at the time of the arrest. Following Giroux’s arrest,

  the officers prepared to search Giroux’s residence for prohibited items, drugs and alcohol,

  as listed in his probation conditions. Prior to the search, Officer Magnusson asked




                                               3

  Giroux if he had any items in the house that were in violation of his probation conditions.

  Giroux stated he still had the ammunition can that he had previously reported. The

  officers searched Giroux’s residence and found, in the loft above the kitchen, a military-

  style, metal ammunition can containing several boxes of ammunition. The can and

  ammunition were seized and form the basis for the instant federal indictment.

                                                 Discussion

  A.       Sixth Amendment

           Giroux made the statements in question on September 26, 2006, shortly before he

  was arrested for violating his state probation. He claims the statements were obtained in

  violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. He was not charged with the instant

  felon in possession of ammunition offense until a complaint was issued on October 4,

  2006. Giroux did not make his first court appearance on the federal charge until February

  28, 2007. Even if Giroux had a Sixth Amendment right to counsel on the State of Maine

  probation violation charge at the time he made the statements in question,2 his contention

  fails because the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is “offense-specific,” and the

  statements are now sought to be used not in the state probation revocation hearing for

  which the warrant was obtained, but in a new federal prosecution on a felon in possession

  of ammunition charge that was not yet charged at the time of the statements. See, Texas
  2
            Giroux contends that his right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment had attached at the time the
  statements in question were made, because a probation revocation warrant had already been issued. The
  government’s response is that Giroux has not established that a Sixth Amendment right to counsel had
  attached at the time the undercover probation officers met with him on September 26. The First Circuit
  Court of Appeals has recently ruled that a violation of supervised release is not a “criminal offense” but
  rather a violation that may result in an increase in a sentence. United States v. Smith, ___F.3d ___, No. 07-
  1246, 2007 WL 2367795, *4, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 19819, *11-13 (1st Cir. Aug. 21, 2007); see also
  Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 782 (1973) (probation revocation like parole revocation is not a stage of
  a criminal prosecution). Giroux had not yet appeared in court for even his initial appearance on the state
  probation revocation matter in any event and, although the State of Maine provides court-appointed counsel
  for probation revocation proceedings, the record is devoid of any evidence that counsel had been assigned
  to Giroux at the time of the statements.

  v. Cobb, 532 U.S. 162, 168 (2001) (“[A] defendant’s statements regarding offenses for

  which he had not been charged [are] admissible notwithstanding the attachment of his

  Sixth Amendment right to counsel on other charged offenses.”); see also, Maine v.

  Moulton, 474 U.S. 159, 180, n. 16 (1985) (dictum) (“[T]o exclude evidence pertaining to

  charges as to which the Sixth Amendment right to counsel had not attached at the time

  the evidence was obtained, simply because other charges were pending at that time,

  would unnecessarily frustrate the public’s interest in the investigation of criminal

  activities.”); United States v. Shea, 211 F.3d 658, 667 (1st Cir. 2000) (no Sixth

  Amendment violation when undercover government informant questioned Shea

  defendant about a bank robbery while he was incarcerated for earlier attempted bank

  robbery, because defendant Shea had not yet been charged with second robbery).

         Giroux's reliance on United States v. Bender, 221 F.3d 265, 268-69 (1st Cir.

  2000), does not move his argument forward. Although the conversation with the police

  undercover agent in Bender's case did involve other charges and events than the pending

  case for which counsel had been appointed, the point of the case was that the Government

  was prevented from using the statements as incriminating statements in the then pending

  case for which counsel had been appointed. The case simply reiterates the point that the

  Sixth Amendment right is offense specific and must be evaluated in light of the context in

  which the statements were made.

  B.     Fifth Amendment

         Giroux also claims that his Fifth Amendment right against self- incrimination was

  violated because P.O. Day's conduct rendered his statements involuntary and therefore

  subject to suppression. Giroux claims the statements were rendered involuntary, not




                                               5
Case 1:07-cr-00042-JAW Document 38 Filed 10/17/07 Page 6 of 8                      PageID #: 69



  because of any threats or promises made to him, but "rather by the enticing nature of a

  promise to buy land for purposes of hunting" and "by officers who knew that the

  Defendant had been under the continuing care of a psychiatrist, that he had persistent

  delusions regarding money owed to him, and may have played on this particular

  psychological weakness by posing as purchasers of this parcel of property." (Mot. to

  Suppress a 4-5.) Giroux's theory does not hold water in light of the evidence presented at

  the hearing on the motion.

         The burden is on the government to prove that the defendant’s statements were

  voluntary by a preponderance of the evidence. Lego v. Twomey, 404 U.S. 477, 489

  (1972). The government must show that, based on the totality of the circumstances, the

  investigating agents neither “broke” nor overbore the defendant’s will, Chambers v.

  Florida, 309 U.S. 227, 240 (1940), and that his statements were “the product of a rational

  intellect and a free will,” Blackburn v. Alabama, 361 U.S. 199, 208 (1960). See also

  Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U.S. 528, 534 (1963). As this language suggests, “coercive

  police activity is a necessary predicate to the finding that a confession is not ‘voluntary’.”

  Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157, 167 (1986). Coercive police activity may include

  either the creation of a susceptible psychological state in the person interrogated,

  Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 307-308 (1963) (concerning alleged administration of

  “truth serum” to quell heroin addict’s withdrawal symptoms), or the exploitation of an

  existing psychological condition, Blackburn, 361 U.S. at 207-208 (“[A] most basic sense

  of justice is affronted by the spectacle of incarcerating a human being upon the basis of a

  statement he made while insane.”) The First Circuit has noted that because a suspect is in

  a weakened condition because of his heroin withdrawal symptoms, it does not necessarily




                                                6
Case 1:07-cr-00042-JAW Document 38 Filed 10/17/07 Page 7 of 8                      PageID #: 70



  follow that his post-arrest statements are involuntary. United States v. Palmer, 203 F.3d

  55, 61-62 (1st Cir. 2000) (“In the context of the voluntariness of a confession, a

  defendant’s mental state by itself and apart from its relation to official coercion never

  disposes of the inquiry into constitutional voluntariness.”).

         In the context of the present case there are neither unsavory threats by the officers

  nor a hint of chemical substances being involved in the situation. Whatever

  psychological disorders Giroux may suffer from, he certainly does not present himself as

  an "insane" individual being wrongfully exploited by the police into making an

  involuntary confession to a crime. Giroux's mental state at the time he made the

  statements, whatever it may then have been, does not dispose of the issue of

  constitutional voluntariness. The fact of the matter is that the officers did nothing other

  than pose as prospective purchasers of the land, individuals invited onto the premises by

  Giroux. In these circumstances there is no constitutional infirmity in the resulting

  voluntary statements made by Giroux.

                                          Conclusion

         Based upon the foregoing I recommend the court adopt these proposed findings of

  fact and deny the motion to suppress.
