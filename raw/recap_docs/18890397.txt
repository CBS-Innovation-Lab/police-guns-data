UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
United States of America

v. Criminal No. 08-mj-1 17-01-JM

Francisco Burgado

0 R D E R

Defendant,' by his counsel, has moved for a determination of mental competency
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 4-241. Based upon defense counsel’s representations as to past
findings of incompetency by another court in the past, I find reasonable cause to believe
that the defendant may presently be suffering from a mental disease or defect that could
affect his competency to stand trial. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 4241(b) and 4247(b), the
defendant is committed to the custody of the Attomey General for a period not to exceed
thirty days for placement in a suitable facility where an examination of the defendant’s
mental condition can be conducted. The director of the facility may apply for a
reasonable extension as provided by 18 U.S.C. § 4247(b). The examining officials shall
prepare a report of their findings pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 4247(b), which report shall be
filed with this court. The court requests prior notification of the date of the defendant’s
return to this jurisdiction after the examination so that a prompt competency hearing and

detention hearing my be held.

SO ORDERED.
