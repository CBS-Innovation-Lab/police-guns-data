                   o	 For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.c. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
                        identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution Impracticable under 18 USc. § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

             2     0	   For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U S C § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
                        issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims' losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
                        that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 US .c. § 3663A(c)(3)(B)

             3     0	   For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U SC . § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
                        ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh
                        the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 US .c. § 3663(a)( I )(B)(ii)
