                      ORDER ON GOVERNMENT’S OBJECTION
                           TO PRESENTENCE REPORT


       On January 30, 2019, Defendant Damian Ouellette pleaded guilty to possession of a

firearm by a felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). In the Revised

Presentence Investigation Report (“PSR”), the Probation Office determined Mr. Ouellette’s

base offense level to be 14 as he was a “prohibited person” at the time he committed the

instant offense. See U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(a)(6)(A). The government objected, asserting that

because Mr. Ouellette had previously sustained a felony conviction of robbery with a

dangerous weapon – in its estimation, a “crime of violence,” as defined in U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2

– his base offense level should be 20 pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(a)(4)(A). For the reasons

below, I conclude, albeit with deep reservations, that Mr. Ouellette’s prior conviction of

robbery qualifies as a “crime of violence” and, therefore, his base offense level is 20.

                                        DISCUSSION

       Under the current iteration of United States Sentencing Guidelines § 4B1.2, a prior

conviction qualifies as a “crime of violence” in one of two ways. First, under the “force

clause,” a prior felony conviction is considered a crime of violence if the offense charged “has
as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of

another.” U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2(a)(1). Second, under the “enumerated offenses clause,” nine

specific crimes – including robbery – are identified as offenses that categorically qualify as

crimes of violence. Id. § 4B1.2(a)(2).

        The parties focus their arguments on whether Mr. Ouellette’s prior robbery1 conviction

– and particularly the requisite degree of force entailed by that conviction – qualifies as a

crime of violence under the enumerated offenses clause. A plain reading of this clause might

lull a casual observer into a false sense of clarity because robbery is among the enumerated

offenses. However, that inclusion “does not end the required analysis.” United States v.

Childers, No. 1:16-CR-00079-JAW, 2017 WL 2559858, at *10 (D. Me. June 13, 2017).

Instead, because robbery is left undefined in the Guidelines, I must apply the analytical

framework established in Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575 (1990), to determine whether

the prior state conviction qualifies as a “crime of violence.” United States v. Ramirez, 708

F.3d 295, 300 – 302 & n.8 (1st Cir. 2013).



1
  In 2013, Mr. Ouellette was indicted for violation of 17-A M.R.S. § 651(1)(E). Gov’t Ex. A (charging that
Mr. Oullette was “armed with a dangerous weapon, brass knuckles” when he “commit[ed] or attempt[ed] to
commit theft” and “threaten[ed] to use force against [the victim] . . . with the intent to prevent or overcome
resistance to the taking of the property, or the retention of the property immediately after the taking, or to
compel the person in control of the property to give it up or to engage in other conduct which aided in the
taking or carrying away of the property.”). On May 8, 2013, Mr. Ouellette entered a nolo contendere plea and
was convicted of robbery with a dangerous weapon. Gov’t Exs. B, C.
The parties do not attempt to revisit the distinction between robbery and robbery with a dangerous weapon.
As explained by the government:
        The Government is not arguing, in this case, that this Court should give weight in this
        determination to the fact that the defendant was convicted of an armed robbery. In making that
        decision here, the Government is guided by the First Circuit’s interpretation of the
        Massachusetts robbery statute in United States v. Starks, 861 F.3d 306, 320 (1st Cir. 2017) (no
        basis for concluding that armed robbery requires a greater degree of force than unarmed
        robbery).
Gov’t. Sentencing Mem., 5 n.1.
                                                      2
       The first step is determining the applicability of either the categorical or modified

categorical approach. The categorical approach is essentially the default rule; it is used unless

the “defendant’s prior conviction is for violating a ‘divisible statute’ – i.e., a statute that ‘sets

forth one or more elements of a particular offense in the alternative.’” United States v. Ramos-

Gonzalez, 775 F.3d 483, 505 (1st Cir. 2015) (quoting United States v. Fish, 758 F.3d 1, 6 (1st

Cir. 2014)). Using either the categorical or modified categorical approach, the court then

isolates the elements of the crime of conviction (and not the defendant’s actual, related

conduct) and compares those elements to the elements of the “generic definition of the

enumerated offense.” Ramirez, 708 F.3d at 302 n.8; see also Taylor, 495 U.S. at 598

(requiring the distillation of the “generic, contemporary meaning” of an enumerated offense);

Descamps v. United States, 570 U.S. 254, 257 (2013) (“[Courts] compare the elements of the

statute forming the basis of the defendant’s conviction with the elements of the ‘generic’

crime – i.e., the offense as commonly understood.”). If comparison reveals that the Maine

robbery statute has the same elements as the generic crime of robbery or is narrower than

generic robbery, then the prior robbery conviction qualifies as an enumerated offense under

the Guidelines. Childers, 2017 WL 2559858, at *10 – 11. If, however, the “statute sweeps

more broadly than the generic crime,” the prior conviction will not qualify. Descamps, 570

U.S. at 261.

A.     Inquiry I: Crime of Conviction

       In a curious departure from the bedrock principle undergirding the Sentencing

Guidelines – “relevant conduct” – I am required to scrutinize “the statutory definitions of the

prior offenses, and not . . . the particular facts underlying those convictions” through the lens

of either the categorical or modified-categorical approach. Taylor, 495 U.S. at 600. While
                                                 3
the resolution of this inquiry is “no walk in the park,” United States v. Mulkern, 854 F.3d 87,

90 (1st Cir. 2017), my task has been simplified by the First Circuit’s conclusion that 17-A

M.R.S. § 651 2 is divisible and, thus, the modified-categorical approach applies. Id. at 91.

Under the modified-categorical approach, I may rely on Shepard 3 documents (for example,

the indictment, jury instructions, or plea agreement and colloquy) to determine what crime,

with what elements, a defendant was convicted of. Id. (quoting Mathis v. United States, 136

S. Ct. 2243, 2249 (2016)).

          The parties agree that the indictment indicates Mr. Ouellette pleaded guilty to a

violation of 17-A M.R.S. § 651(1)(B) (robbery), to include § 651(1)(E) (armed robbery). The

parties’ arguments focus on subsection (B), 4 which defines robbery as “commit[ing] or



2
    At the time of Ouellette’s conviction, Maine defined “robbery” as follows:
          1. A person is guilty of robbery if the person commits or attempts to commit theft and at the
             time of the person’s actions:
              A.   The actor recklessly inflicts bodily injury on another. Violation of this paragraph is
                   a Class B crime:
              B.   The actor threatens to use force against any person present with the intent:
                   (1)    To prevent or overcome resistance to the taking of the property, or to the
                          retention of the property, or to the retention of the property immediately after
                          the taking; or
                   (2)    To compel the person in control of the property to give it up or to engage in
                          other conduct which aids in the taking or carrying away of the property;
              C.   The actor uses physical force on another which the intent enumerated in paragraph
                   B, subparagraphs (1) or (2);
              D.   The actor intentionally inflicts or attempts to inflict bodily injury on another; or
              E.   The actor or an accomplice to his knowledge is armed with a dangerous weapon in
                   the course of a robbery as defined in paragraphs A through D.
17-A M.R.S. § 651(1).
3
    See Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 26 (2005).
4
 As explained by the Defendant: “It appears that §651(1)(E) was charged because an accomplice was armed.
The government has acknowledged that this fact does not play a role in its argument for applying the
enhancement.” Def.’s Mem., 2.
                                                         4
attempt[ing] to commit theft” and “threaten[ing] to use force against any person present with

the intent: (1) To prevent or overcome resistance to the taking of the property, or to the

retention of the property immediately after the taking; or (2) To compel the person in control

of the property to give it up or to engage in other conduct that aids in the taking or carrying

away of the property.” 17-A M.R.S. § 651(1)(B). The Legislature separately criminalized

robbery effectuated through the actual use of force in subsection (C) of the robbery statute.

       In Raymond v. State, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court addressed the degree of force

required to qualify as robbery under 17–A M.R.S. § 651(1)(C) and, specifically, whether the

act of snatching a bag from the victim’s hand was sufficient to sustain a conviction. 467 A.2d

161, 162 (Me. 1983). The Law Court sustained the defendant’s conviction, and it held that

“any physical force with the intent [to deprive] should be sufficient to raise a theft offense to

the level of robbery.” Id. at 165. See also Mulkern, 854 F.3d at 93 (citing Raymond to like

effect).   In other words, in Maine, the degree of force required to commit “actual force”

robbery is “any physical force,” including the force necessary to snatch an item of property

from someone’s grasp. Defendant argues that because mere “snatching” force would suffice

to sustain a robbery conviction in Maine, his conviction is per se not a crime of violence.

Def.’s Mem. 3. Defendant argues it does not matter that his conviction was under § 651(1)(B)

(robbery by threat) rather than § 651(1)(C) (robbery by use of force). He cites Mulkern in

support of his position, observing that the First Circuit there stated it made no difference for

purposes of the force clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act. Id., citing Mulkern, 854 F.3d

at 93-94. I am not persuaded. In Mulkern, the Court considered whether a Maine robbery

conviction implied a degree of force “capable of causing physical pain or injury,” following

the guidance set by the Supreme Court in Johnson v. United States, 559 U.S. 133, 140 (2010).
                                               5
See Mulkern, 854 F.3d at 93-94. Here, on the other hand, I consider whether a Maine robbery

conviction predicated on a threat of force is a “generic” robbery conviction, based on the

contemporary understanding of robbery among the several States.

B.     Inquiry II: Generic, Contemporary Definition

       The second inquiry dictated by the Taylor framework is more difficult: what is “generic

robbery” – more specifically, what degree of force is encompassed by the robbery offense

identified in U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2(a)(2)– and how is it divined? Taylor instructs that I must

determine the “generic, contemporary meaning” of the charged offense through an

examination of how “the term is now used in the criminal codes of most States” and, at times,

supplemented by a review of the Modern Penal Code and contemporary treatises. 495 U.S.

at 589, 598 & n.8 (indicating that the “modern ‘generic’ view” of a crime “roughly

correspond[s] to the definitions of [the crime found] in a majority of the States’ criminal

codes.”). The First Circuit has not yet determined the generic definition of robbery. However,

it has held that a state robbery conviction under a statute that requires at least the threat of

bodily injury “substantially corresponds to the definition of generic robbery.” United States

v. Ball, 870 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2017) (applying 2015 Guidelines Manual, § 4B1.2 application

note listing robbery as an exemplar crime of violence). Here we ponder a state statute that

allows a robbery conviction to stand on use of “any force,” so Ball is not decisive.

Additionally, the First Circuit has yet to prescribe the proper methodology for determining

the generic definition of a crime. As I see it, the inquiry boils down to what amount of force

must be threatened to support a conviction for “generic” robbery and whether that amount of

force corresponds with the minimal requirements of Maine law.


                                               6
       While the First Circuit has not yet prescribed a ready answer, other circuit courts have

sanctioned two approaches leading to divergent assessments concerning the amount of force

needed to commit generic robbery. Some circuits conclude that the majority of state criminal

codes provide that generic robbery requires no more than de minimis force. See United States

v. Graves, 877 F.3d 494, 503 (3d Cir. 2017), cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 159 (2018) (“We now

join the Seventh and Eleventh Circuits and hold that generic robbery requires no more than

de minimis force.”); United States v. Molinar, 881 F.3d 1064, 1073 (9th Cir. 2017) (“Again,

the generic definition of robbery encompasses not only de minimis force sufficient to compel

acquiescence to the taking of or escaping with property, but also the implied threat of force.”

(footnote omitted)). Looking to the Model Penal Code and state laws defining robbery, the

Graves court noted a fundamental “disjunction”: “[T]he MPC requires that there be some

actual or threatened injury to another person for a theft to qualify as robbery. . . . [H]owever,

there are thirty-eight states which define robbery as theft involving the use of even de minimis

force.” Graves, 877 F.3d at 502. Relying on its reading of Taylor, the Graves court concluded

that “the most important factor in defining the generic version of an offense is the approach

of the majority of state statutes defining the crime.” Id. at 504. It reasoned:

       Affording predominant weight to the majority of states best recognizes that
       “Congress’ basic goal in passing the Sentencing Act was to move the sentencing
       system in the direction of increased uniformity.” While the MPC is a useful
       starting point, its definition of ‘robbery’ does not supersede the way in which
       the majority of states have defined that offense.

Id. (footnotes omitted, quoting United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 253 (2005)). Similarly,

the Ninth Circuit in Molinar relied primarily on the definition of robbery in the majority of

states to conclude that generic robbery encompasses even de minimis force. Molinar, 881

F.3d at 1072.
                                               7
          Other circuits conclude that generic robbery requires the application of something

more than minimal force. United States v. Gattis, 877 F.3d 150, 159 (4th Cir. 2017), cert.

denied, 138 S. Ct. 1572 (2018) (“[J]ust like generic robbery committed through the use of

force, to commit robbery by force in North Carolina, the defendant must do more than

stealthily pickpocket or suddenly snatch; he must direct a degree of force towards the victim

beyond the minimum necessary to remove the item from the victim’s grasp.”); United States

v. Yates, 866 F.3d 723, 730, 734 (6th Cir. 2017) (holding that generic robbery requires the

application of more than “minimal use of force”; looking instead to whether the circumstances

presented immediate danger to the victim); United States v. Santiesteban-Hernandez, 469

F.3d 376, 380 (5th Cir. 2006) (same, abrogated on other grounds). In arriving at this

conclusion, the Sixth Circuit, for example, relies on contemporary scholars to do the heavy

lifting of analysis and, considering the effort of combing through and keeping tabs on the

ever-changing whims of legislative fancy, this approach is perfectly understandable. The

additional appeal to this approach is in its near immutability, which makes marginally easier

the task of applying the modified-categorical approach.

          Nevertheless, Taylor appears, quite plainly, to require me to give priority of importance

to how robbery is now used in the criminal codes of most States and subordinate consideration

to how the Model Penal Code classifies the offense 5 or how scholars have characterized the


5
    As noted by the Graves court:
          The MPC defines “robbery” as requiring one of three things to occur in the course of
          committing a theft: the offender must “(a) inflict[ ] serious bodily injury upon another; or (b)
          threaten[ ] another with or purposively put him in fear of immediate serious bodily injury; or
          (c) commit[ ] or threaten[ ] immediately to commit any felony of the first or second degree.”
          Thus, the MPC requires that there be some actual or threatened injury to another person for a
          theft to qualify as robbery.
Graves, 877 F.3d at 502 (emphasis added); see also Model Penal Code § 222.1.
                                                         8
variations in state criminal codes. Taylor, 495 U.S. at 598. After reviewing the multitude of

statutory provisions defining robbery across the states (including Puerto Rico and the District

of Columbia), I conclude that Maine’s divisible robbery statute may not be entirely generic in

application insofar as it encompasses the act of snatching property from the grip of an

unsuspecting and therefore non-resistant victim. However, as applied to robbery by threat,

which Plaintiff was convicted of, Maine law appears to be generic in its application because

most other states similarly treat dispossession by threat of force as robbery. In a threat

scenario, unlike a snatch scenario, one deprives another person of property by threat of using,

categorically, whatever degree of force is needed to forcibly overcome any resistance that is

offered. 6   Indeed, any lesser degree of force would not be a “threat.”                       Consequently,

Defendant’s prior conviction for robbery (by threat) rests in the heartland of most states’

definitions of robbery (by threat), 7 and therefore, is coextensive with “generic robbery.”



6
  The Supreme Court recently held, in a separate but analogous context (the ACCA elements clause), that the
well-established common law understanding of robbery has long required the use of a degree of force sufficient
to overcome resistance, “however slight the resistance.” Stokeling v. United States, 139 S. Ct. 544, 551 (2019)
(quoting W. Clark & W. Marshall, Law of Crimes 553 (H. Lazell ed., 2d ed. 1905)). The Court also decidedly
opined that, at least as of the 1986 amendment of the ACCA, it was well-established in the common law that
the force inherent in the crime of robbery does not encompass the mere “snatching” of property. Id. at 555.
7
  Many distinctions could be drawn between the various state statutes. However, for purposes of my inquiry,
I focus on the force dictated by the statutory text of each state’s definition of robbery. The statutory language
varies; however, like the Maine subsection at issue in this case, 25 states and Puerto Rico define robbery to
include theft accomplished through the threat of force (and sometimes, even fear) – a degree of force that falls
short of the Model Penal Code’s severity standard requiring infliction or threat of physical harm or bodily
injury. For example, in Arizona, an individual commits robbery if they, “in the course of taking any property
of another from his person or immediate presence and against his will, . . . threaten[] . . . force against any
person with intent either to coerce surrender of property or to prevent resistance to such person taking or
retaining property.” Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 13-1902(A). See also Ala. Code § 13A-8-43(a); Alaska Stat. Ann.
§ 11.41.510(a); Ark. Code Ann. § 5-12-102(a); Cal. Penal Code § 211; Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 18-4-301(1);
Conn. Gen. Stat. § 53a-133; Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, § 831(A); Fla. Stat. Ann. § 812.131(1); Haw. Rev. Stat.

        While I believe this survey approach is the most faithful to the Supreme Court’s

guidance, I have deep reservations regarding its practical implications. In order to accurately

assess a contemporary definition of robbery, the district judge is obligated to periodically

distill the perpetual potpourri of changes to state criminal codes. Moreover, it would suggest

that in Maine a conviction for robbery by threat might increase the base offense level of a

firearm possession conviction, whereas a conviction for robbery by actual use of force,


Rev. Stat. Ann. § 164.395(1); P.R. Laws Ann. Tit. 33, § 4826; 11 R.I. Gen. Laws Ann. § 11-39-1(b); S.D.
Codified Laws § 22-30-1; Utah Code Ann. § 76-6-301(1); Wis. Stat. Ann. § 943.32(1).
In contrast, 11 states, along with the Model Penal Code, appear to require a rather dire threat for a robbery
conviction, such as would arise from an armed robbery scenario, i.e., a threat of force likely to result in
immediate bodily injury. For example, Pennsylvania law states that “[a] person is guilty of robbery if, in the
course of committing a theft, he . . . threatens another with or intentionally puts him in fear of immediate
serious bodily injury.” 18 Pa. Stat. and Cons. Stat. Ann. § 3701(a)(1)(ii). See also Iowa Code Ann. §
711.1(1)(b); Miss. Code. Ann. § 97-3-73; Mo. Ann. Stat. §§ 570.025, 570.010(13); Mont. Code Ann. § 45-5-
401(1); N.J. Stat. Ann. § 2C:15-1(a); N.D. Cent. Code Ann. § 12.1-22-01(1);; Tex. Penal Code Ann. § 29.02(a);
Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, § 608(a); Va. Code Ann. § 18.2-58; Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 6-2-401(a).
Straddling the gap between these two definitions, 14 states and the District of Columbia criminalize the use of
force using qualifiers such as “bodily injury” or “violence,” yet also criminalize conduct that would generate
“fear.” See D.C. Code Ann. § 22-2801 (“Whoever by force or violence, whether against resistance or by
sudden or stealthy seizure or snatching, or by putting in fear, shall take from the person or immediate actual
possession of another anything of value, is guilty of robbery”); Ga. Code Ann. § 16-8-40(a); Kan. Stat. Ann. §
21-5420(a); Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 277, § 39; Md. Code Ann., Crim. Law § 3-401 (adopting the “judicially
determined meaning” of robbery); State v. Stewart, 211 A.3d 371, 385 (Md. 2019) (“This Court has

2002) (“Robbery is defined as the felonious or unlawful taking of money, goods or other personal property of
any value from the person of another or in his presence by violence or by putting such person in fear.”); Tenn.
Code Ann. § 39-13-401; Wash. Rev. Code Ann. § 9A.56.190; W. Va. Code Ann. § 61-2-12(c). For purposes
of this tallying approach, because these statutes criminalize conduct sufficient to cause fear, I include them
with those, like Maine, which criminalize the threat of force sufficient to overcome resistance.
In sum, 39 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, based on the plain language of the relevant
statutes, criminalize the threat of force and do not require the heightened standard of a threat of such force as
would necessarily impose physical harm. In other words, it is generic/typical for robbery to encompass the
taking of property from another through the threat of force sufficient to dispossess, and not merely through
application of force sufficient to harm.

currently classified as a more serious offense in Maine, might not. These vagaries produced

by the categorical approach are nothing new.

        Among the many advantages of Congress or the Sentencing Commission eventually

using plain language to define “crime of violence” is that we might geometrically enhance

our prospects of shared understanding. This would be particularly useful in what should be a

transparent, predictable and uniform approach to federal sentencing. A criminal defendant

ought not have to wait with bated breath while a federal judge counts how many angels can

dance on the head of a pin in arriving at a base offense level. It appears that out of an effort

toward metaphysical certainty, which gave us the current conundrum, we are left with all

metaphysics but no certainty.         This component of the Guidelines sows only disparity and

confusion which, as the First Circuit so aptly put it, results in “a Rube Goldberg jurisprudence

of abstractions piled on top of one another in a manner that renders doubtful anyone’s

confidence in predicting what will pop out at the end.” 8 United States v. Tavares, 843 F.3d

  Although lengthy, the First Circuit’s frustrations specific to the application of the “elements clause” under
the Guidelines on this point bear repeating in full:
        Even a careful reader of this opinion may at this point feel lost. We began with a seemingly
        simple question. Has Tavares been convicted of a crime of violence? Trying to answer that
        question then led us down several rabbit holes . . . .
        In a sensible world, Congress and/or the Sentencing Commission would have made a list of
        state and federal laws deemed to be crimes of violence that warranted the desired penalties
        and sentencing enhancements. At its margins, such a list might be over- or under-broad. It
        would, though, be straightforward.
        Instead of using a simple list, the drafters adopted abstract descriptions of the crimes that
        would appear on such a list, employing terms such as “physical force,” “use,” “injury,” and so
        on. The result is a Rube Goldberg jurisprudence of abstractions piled on top of one another in
        a manner that renders doubtful anyone's confidence in predicting what will pop out at the end.
        Cf. Almanza–Arenas v. Lynch, 815 F.3d 469, 483–84 (9th Cir. 2015) (en banc) (Owens, J.,
        concurring).
        What pops out matters a great deal. In Fish, one could not know whether certain conduct was
        lawful or criminal unless one knew whether a prior crime was a crime of violence. Here,

1, 19 (1st Cir. 2016) (untangling whether a defendant’s prior offenses qualify as “crimes of

violence” under the former residual clause of § 4B1.2(a)(2))).

        I am hardly the first and, I predict, will not be the last federal judge to shout into the

wind on this point. 9 There is cause for optimism that change might soon be on the way. 10 In

the meantime, I am particularly mindful that the Guidelines are merely advisory. However,

if the Guidelines are to provide a meaningful heartland for federal sentencing, we ought not

to confuse painting over the stained ceiling with fixing the leaking roof.

        Despite the frustration with which I apply this convoluted standard, which, in my view,

only undercuts the ability of the Guidelines to effectively fulfill its role as “the lodestone of

sentencing,” Peugh v. United States, 569 U.S. 530, 544 (2013), I conclude that for purposes

of the Sentencing Guidelines, a Maine conviction for robbery by threat counts as a predicate

crime of violence because the offense, categorically, is a generic robbery offense.

                                             CONCLUSION

        For the foregoing reasons, Mr. Ouellette’s prior robbery conviction qualifies as a

“crime of violence,” as enumerated in U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2(a)(2). Therefore, the Government’s




        Tavares could not know—within years—the guidance applicable to his sentencing. Nor could
        one get confident answers by asking a lawyer—or even a judge. So what do we do here?

  In particular, I appreciate the sentiment expressed by Judge Owens: “I continue to urge the Commission to
simplify the Guidelines to avoid the frequent sentencing adventures more complicated than reconstructing the
Staff of Ra in the Map Room to locate the Well of the Souls.” United States v. Perez-Silvan, 861 F.3d 935,
944 (9th Cir. 2017) (Owens, J., concurring) (citing Raiders of the Lost Ark (Paramount Pictures 1981)).

  It should be noted that in response to criticisms that the categorical approach is an “overly complex, time
consuming, resource-intensive analysis that often leads to litigation and uncertainty” and concerns that the
definition of “generic robbery” is underinclusive, the Sentencing Commission proposed amendments to the
Federal Sentencing Guidelines in December 2018 that proposed three potential definitions for robbery.
