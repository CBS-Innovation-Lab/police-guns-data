to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, mcdical carc, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner

Defendant has tried to better himself. He has completed high school and attended, briefiy, a community college. He has the
ability to continue on this path and with adequate support, may succeed. His record so far is not serious and this sentence
will adequately punish him without removing him from his family and community support for too long a period of time to
enable him to continue his self improvcment efforts.

STATEMENT OF REASONS

VII COURT DETERMINATIONS OF RESTITUTION
A m Restitution Not Applicable.

B Total Amount of Restitution:
C Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

l [:] For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identiliable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(A)‘

- [:] For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex

issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree

that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(13).
3 \:i For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C. §3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh

the need to provide restitution to any victims under 13 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(1)(Et)(ii).

4 [:] Restitution is not ordered for other reasons (Exp|ain_)
D E Partial restitution is ordered for these reasons (18 U.S.C. § 3553(€)):

Vlll ADDITIONAL FACTS JUSTIFYING THE SENTENCE IN THIS CASE (lfapplieable.)

Because defendant`s conviction for resisting arrest (P29) is not according to the complaint, a crime oi`violence, Base Offense chcl is 20
(PIS) and the Tota| Offcnse Level is 19 (P25).

Sections 1, 11, 111, IV, and Vll of the Statement of Reasons form must be completed in all felony cases.
