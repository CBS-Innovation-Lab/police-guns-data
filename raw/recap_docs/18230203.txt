           ORDER AFFIRMING THE RECOMMENDED DECISION
                    OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE

      Charged with two counts of possession of a firearm after having been

previously convicted of crimes punishable for a term of more than one year of

imprisonment, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), Jonathan Gardiner moves to

suppress any and all evidence seized from his residence on November 13, 2014

following a warrantless search. After a de novo determination, the Court affirms the

Magistrate Judge’s recommended decision and concludes that the scope of the consent

for the search was not limited and that it extended to the attic, and in any event, the

Magistrate Judge correctly applied the inevitable discovery exception to the

exclusionary rule.

I.    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

      On July 13, 2016, a federal grand jury indicted Jonathan Gardiner with two

counts of possession of a firearm after having previously been convicted of crimes

punishable for a term of more than one year of imprisonment, in violation of 18 U.S.C.

§ 922(g)(1). Indictment (ECF No. 3). Mr. Gardiner pleaded not guilty to both counts

on July 20, 2016. Min. Entry (ECF No. 10).

      On September 19, 2016, Mr. Gardiner filed a motion to suppress any and all

evidence seized from his residence on November 13, 2014 following a warrantless

search. Def.’s Mot. to Suppress (ECF No. 30). The Government responded to the

Defendant’s motion to suppress on October 4, 2016. Gov’t’s Resp. to Def.’s Mot. to

Suppress (ECF No. 33).

      On December 7, 2016, the Magistrate Judge held a suppression hearing, which

was completed on December 12, 2016.        Min. Entry (ECF Nos. 37, 49); Tr. of

Proceedings, Mot. to Suppress (Dec. 7, 2016) (ECF No. 63) (Suppression Tr.); Tr. of

Proceedings, Ctd. Mot. to Suppress & Initial Appearance (Dec. 12, 2016) (ECF No. 64)

(Ctd. Suppression Tr.).   On January 6, 2017, the Magistrate Judge issued a

recommended decision in which he made twenty-two factual findings. Recommended

Decision on Mot. to Suppress (ECF No. 59) (Rec. Dec.).      Based on those factual

findings, the Magistrate Judge concluded that the warrantless search and seizure

complied with the Fourth Amendment and recommended that the Court deny Mr.

Gardiner’s motion to suppress. Id.

      Mr. Gardiner objected to the recommended decision on January 23, 2017.

II.   PROPOSED FACTUAL FINDINGS

      On November 13, 2014, at approximately 6 p.m., two deputies of the Penobscot

County Sheriff’s office (Deputies Allen and Roy) responded to a call from a residence

in Glenburn, Maine, regarding the discharge of a weapon.         Rec. Dec. ¶ 1.    An

individual at the residence informed the officers that shots were fired outside a

nearby house. Id. ¶ 2. The house identified by the individual was Mr. Gardiner’s

house located at 184 Lakeview Drive in Glenburn (the property). Id. ¶ 3.

      When the officers arrived at the property, Deputy Allen knocked on the front

door. Id. ¶ 4. Angela Barry appeared at the door. Id. Ms. Barry informed the officers

that she was Mr. Gardiner’s girlfriend, and that she resided on the property with Mr.

Gardiner and their child. Id. ¶ 5. She also informed the officers that three other

individuals lived on the property. Id. Ms. Barry told the officers that Mr. Gardiner

was not at home, that he was at work, and that he worked at Burger King. Id. ¶ 6.

When the officers advised Ms. Barry that they had received a complaint of shots fired

outside the residence, Ms. Barry said she had no knowledge of any shots fired. Id. ¶

7.

      Deputy Allen asked Ms. Barry if the officers could search the outside of the

residence, to which Ms. Barry consented. Id. ¶ 8. During the search, Deputy Allen

located a shooting target area in the back of the property. Id. ¶ 9. The officers also

found some shell casings in the area. Id. Through dispatch, the officers learned that

both Ms. Barry and Mr. Gardiner were convicted felons. Id. ¶ 10. They also learned

of an outstanding arrest warrant for Mr. Gardiner for the failure to pay a fine. Id.




                                             3
Case 1:16-cr-00091-JAW Document 66 Filed 03/22/17 Page 4 of 24          PageID #: 394



When Deputy Allen reported to Ms. Barry the results of the search, Ms. Barry said

she had no knowledge of the target area. Id. ¶ 11. The officers asked Ms. Barry for

consent to search the residence. Id. ¶ 12. Ms. Barry declined to consent to the search.

Id.

      At approximately the same time the officers were concluding their

conversation with Ms. Barry, a vehicle approached the property but then changed

direction and began to travel away from the property. Id. ¶ 13. Deputy Allen followed

the vehicle, stopped the vehicle, and learned the driver of the vehicle was Jennifer

Marshall, one of the individuals who lived on the property. Id. Deputy Allen returned

to the property with Ms. Marshall. Id.

      As Deputy Allen was following Ms. Marshall’s vehicle, Deputy Roy spoke with

Ms. Barry at the front of the house. Id. ¶ 14. When he was speaking with Ms. Barry,

Deputy Roy heard a male voice from inside the house say “don’t let him in here – they

can’t come in without a warrant.” Id. Ms. Barry said the person was Forrest, one of

the individuals who also lived on the property. Id. Ms. Barry then closed the door.

Id. Deputy Roy then planned to wait for backup and to secure the property. Id. ¶ 15.

As he walked to the back of the property, he observed an individual who appeared to

be running from the rear of the house. Id. Deputy Roy enlisted Deputy Allen’s

assistance in the pursuit of the individual, but the officers were unable to apprehend

the person. Id.

      Sergeant Sheehan arrived at the scene to assist. Id. ¶ 16. When Sergeant

Sheehan spoke to Ms. Barry and Ms. Marshall, Ms. Barry told him that the person




                                              4
Case 1:16-cr-00091-JAW Document 66 Filed 03/22/17 Page 5 of 24           PageID #: 395



who was running was Forrest, but she did not know his last name. Id. When Ms.

Barry and Ms. Marshall spoke with Sergeant Sheehan, Ms. Barry and Ms. Marshall

consented to the search of the property.      Id. ¶ 17.   Contrary to Mr. Gardiner’s

assertion, the scope of the consent was not limited to a search for Mr. Gardiner. Id.

      Officers then searched the house. Id. ¶ 18. As part of the search, Deputies Roy

and Allen went into the bedroom Ms. Barry shared with Mr. Gardiner. Id. While in

the bedroom, the officers observed some debris, including what appeared to be pieces

of insulation, on some of the items in the closet. Id. A panel in the ceiling above the

closet appeared to have some insulation hanging from it. Id. The officers were

concerned that a person had accessed the attic through the panel, and could be hiding

in the attic. Id. When the officers pointed out their observations to Ms. Barry, and

asked Ms. Barry whether anyone was in the attic, she said no. Id. Deputy Roy

decided to look above the ceiling panel. Id. ¶ 19. Ms. Barry, who could see the officers

in the bedroom, did not raise any objection to the scope of the search. Id. Deputy Roy

stood on a stool and looked into the attic. Id. He saw what appeared to be a soft

firearms case, and removed the case from the attic. Id. The case was camouflaged,

and the shape and weight of the content of the case were consistent with a gun. Id.

Deputy Roy opened the case, and found a sawed-off shotgun inside the case. Id.

      Following the search, Ms. Barry and Ms. Marshall signed forms entitled

“Permission to Search.” Id. ¶ 20. According to the forms, Ms. Barry and Ms. Marshall

authorized a search of the “Residence (Bed Room) (common areas).” Id. The forms

also stated that Ms. Barry and Ms. Marshall gave “permission to the [] officer, and




                                              5
Case 1:16-cr-00091-JAW Document 66 Filed 03/22/17 Page 6 of 24                        PageID #: 396



any other law enforcement officer that he needs to assist him, to conduct a search of

the computer, CDs, floppy discs, and zip discs.” Id. When questioned by Deputy Allen

about the results of the search, Ms. Barry did not assert that her consent did not

include consent to search the attic or to search for firearms. Id. ¶ 21. She did not

raise any objection to the scope of the search. Id. If Ms. Barry had not consented to

the search, the officers would have secured the premises and requested a warrant to

conduct a search of the house. Id. ¶ 22.

III.   DISCUSSION

       As the Magistrate Judge’s Recommended Decision is on a motion to “suppress

evidence in a criminal case,” 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A), this Court reviews the

Recommended Decision de novo under 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B).

       A.      Factual Objections

       Mr. Gardiner makes three objections to the facts found by the Magistrate

Judge. First, Mr. Gardiner objects to the Magistrate Judge’s finding in paragraph 15

that “[Deputy Roy] observed an individual who appeared to be running from the rear

of the house.” Def.’s Objs. at 1. Second, he objects to the finding in paragraph 17 in

so far as it suggests that “the scope of the consent was not limited to a search for

Defendant.” Id. at 2. Third, Mr. Gardiner objects to the finding in paragraph 181 in

so far as it suggests that “[w]hen the officers pointed out their observations to Ms.

Barry, and asked Ms. Barry whether anyone was in the attic, she said no.” Id.


1       Mr. Gardiner states that he objects to the proposed finding at paragraph 19 but quotes the
finding from paragraph 18. Later, in his discussion, Mr. Gardiner confirms that he believes the factual
finding from paragraph 18 is flawed: “This conclusion fails when measured against the flawed factual
finding that Ms. Barry was ‘asked by officers whether anyone was in the attic.’” Def.’s Objs. at 2. The
Court infers that Mr. Gardiner objects to the finding in paragraph 18, not 19.


                                                      6
Case 1:16-cr-00091-JAW Document 66 Filed 03/22/17 Page 7 of 24          PageID #: 397



             1.     Individual Running from Rear of the House

      The Magistrate Judge stated in his recommended decision that “[a]s [Deputy

Roy] walked to the back of the property, he observed an individual who appeared to

be running from the rear of the house.” Rec. Dec. ¶ 15. He later discussed this finding

and concluded that this fact, among others, “would have been sufficient to establish

probable cause in support of a search warrant.” Rec. Dec. at 8. The Magistrate Judge

further stated that he was “satisfied the officers would have secured the property,

requested and obtained a search warrant, and conducted a search that would have

revealed the gun confiscated during the search,” and therefore concluded that the

evidence “would have been discovered by a means that does not offend the protections

of the Fourth Amendment.” Id.

      Mr. Gardiner objects to this factual finding arguing that “Deputy Roy’s

testimony did not contain facts supporting this conclusion.” Def.’s Objs. at 1. He goes

on to say that the Court’s finding, “while perhaps inferred from that and other facts,

is not directly supported by any witness’s testimony.” Id.

      The Court overrules Mr. Gardiner’s objection. The objection is based on a

fallacy. Contrary to Mr. Gardiner’s position that the factfinder in a suppression

hearing must consider only direct evidence, the Magistrate Judge and this Court, as

factfinders, are permitted to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence; direct

support for facts is not required. See United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 712 (1st

Cir. 1992) (permitting factfinders to “draw reasonable inferences from the evidence

based on shared perceptions and understandings of the habits, practices, and

inclinations of human beings”); see also United States v. Brown, 621 F.3d 48, 55 (1st


                                              7
Case 1:16-cr-00091-JAW Document 66 Filed 03/22/17 Page 8 of 24          PageID #: 398



Cir. 2010) (“[Underlying] factual findings are reviewed for clear error, giv[ing] due

weight to inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges”); United States v.

Espinoza, 490 F.3d 41, 46 (1st Cir. 2007) (“[I]f the district court chooses to draw a

reasonable (though not inevitable) inference from a particular combination of facts,

that inference is entitled to deference”).

      The Magistrate Judge’s proposed finding is a reasonable inference from the

record evidence. First, the Magistrate Judge’s finding does not state that Deputy Roy

did, in fact, see an individual run from the rear of the house; it states that “he

observed an individual who appeared to be running from the rear of the house.” Rec.

Dec. ¶ 15 (emphasis supplied). This inference is supported by Deputy Roy’s testimony

in which he said that as he returned to position himself at the back of the property,

“somebody ran from just behind me in the treeline and off toward the neighbor’s

property.” Suppression Tr. 102:24-103:5. Deputy Roy also testified that he heard “a

lot of loud crashing, tree branches breaking,” id. 103:8-9, and that he saw “one male

subject running across the front of [the neighboring] property and around to the back

on the far side.” Id. 103:11-13.

      Additionally, before Deputy Roy moved to the back of the property and saw the

individual running, he was talking to Ms. Barry at the door and heard a male’s voice

from inside the residence tell Ms. Barry not to let the officers in. Id. 99:22-100:20.

Ms. Barry told Deputy Roy the male was Forrest, another roommate. Id. 100:21-24.

Although Ms. Barry testified that she thought that she and her son were the only

ones home, and that she did not remember if the deputies asked her if anyone exited




                                             8
Case 1:16-cr-00091-JAW Document 66 Filed 03/22/17 Page 9 of 24           PageID #: 399



the house, Ctd. Suppression Tr. 42:16-43:7, she stated in her interview with Deputy

Allen later in the evening after the search that Forrest was in the residence when the

police arrived and that “I know he took off because obviously he’s not in the house.”

Gov’t’s Resp. to Def.’s Mot. to Suppress Attach. 4 Interview of Angela Barry by Deputy

Ryan Allen on 11/13/14 at 20:45 at 1–2 (Barry Interview).

      Based on the fact that Deputy Roy heard a male’s voice from inside the home,

and shortly thereafter heard the sound of tree branches breaking and saw a male

individual running from behind the property, and the fact that Ms. Barry confirmed

that a male “took off,” the Magistrate Judge’s inferential finding that Deputy Roy saw

an individual who appeared to be running from the rear of the house is reasonable

and supported by the evidence.

             2.     The Scope of the Consent

      The Magistrate Judge stated in his recommended decision that “[c]ontrary to

Defendant’s assertion, the scope of the consent was not limited to a search for

Defendant.” Rec. Dec. ¶ 17. The Court noted that there is conflicting evidence

surrounding the scope of the search but that “the officers’ testimony is more credible.”

Id. ¶ 17 n.2. Later in his discussion, the Magistrate Judge explains that “Sergeant

Sheehan credibly testified that the scope of the search was not limited” and that “[t]he

officers’ conduct during the search, and Ms. Barry’s response, or lack thereof, to the

scope of the search are consistent with Sergeant Sheehan’s testimony.” Id. at 6. He

states that “[l]ogic suggests that had Ms. Barry limited the consent as Defendant

maintains, she would have objected to the scope of the officers’ search” and therefore




                                              9
Case 1:16-cr-00091-JAW Document 66 Filed 03/22/17 Page 10 of 24            PageID #: 400



concludes that the consent included consent to search the attic and consent to search

for firearms. Id. at 6–7.

      Mr. Gardiner objects to this finding, stating that “Ms. Barry swore under oath

that the Deputy asked her for permission to search the home for the Defendant and

that she gave consent for that quest.       Indeed, her live testimony repeated and

reaffirmed that position.” Def.’s Objs. at 2.

      There is a conflict in the evidence concerning whether the scope of the consent

to search was limited to a search for persons only. In her affidavit, Ms. Barry testified

that the officers asked her consent to search the home for the presence of persons

only. Aff. of Angela Barry ¶¶ 6, 13 (ECF No. 31). Ms. Barry’s testimony reaffirmed

that she consented to a search for persons only. Ctd. Suppression Tr. 11:10-11, 12:3-

5, 53:17-54:2.

      According to the officers, however, the search was not limited to persons only.

Sergeant Sheehan testified that “[Ms. Barry] said that we could go in and search the

residence.    I then asked her to explain further about the firearms inside the

residence.”   Suppression Tr. 134:11-13.        Deputies Allen and Roy testified that

Sergeant Sheehan advised them that Ms. Barry had given consent to search the

residence. Id. 28:14-25, 104:17-19. The fact that the search was not limited is also

reflected in the officers’ reports written the day after the incident. Gov’t’s Resp. to

Def.’s Mot. to Suppress Attach. 1 Free Form Narrative by James E. Roy at 3 (Roy

Report) (“SHEEHAN advised the roommate, MARSHALL had spoken with BARRY

and they agreed to give consent to search the home for firearms and the presence of




                                                10
Case 1:16-cr-00091-JAW Document 66 Filed 03/22/17 Page 11 of 24            PageID #: 401



GARDINER”); id. Attach. 2 Suppl. Narrative by R. Allen at 2 (Allen Report) (“When I

returned to the residence we were given consent to search the residence”); id. Attach.

3 Suppl. Narrative by William Sheehan at 2 (“Angela then stated that I could search

the residence if I wanted to. I told Angela that we will search it when the other

Deputies return”).

      Where there is conflicting testimony, a factfinder is empowered to make a

determination based on the witnesses’ credibility. The Magistrate Judge credited

Sergeant Sheehan’s testimony that the scope of the consent was not limited. Rec.

Dec. at 6. In performing its de novo determination under § 636(b)(1), the Court has

the authority to recall the witnesses to assess their credibility regarding the scope of

the consent. See United States v. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667, 676 (1980) (“If [the district

court] finds there is a problem as to the credibility of a witness or witnesses or for

other good reason, it may, in the exercise of its discretion, call and hear the testimony

of a witness or witnesses in an adversary proceeding”) (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 94-

1609, at 3–4) (alteration in original) (emphasis omitted). However, Mr. Gardiner

gives the Court no reason to do so. He points to no reason why Ms. Barry is more

credible than the officers. Indeed, Ms. Barry’s memory during her testimony was

weak, see Ctd. Suppression Tr. 49:2-12, and she contradicted herself during her live

testimony. Compare id. 16:9-11 (“Q: And is [the attic] an area that you knew existed

prior to that day? A: No”), with id. 54:17-21 (“Q: Prior to this occasion, you’d lived

there at this house a couple years, right? A: Right. Q: You knew the attic was there,

right? A: Yes”). She also made statements during her interview shortly after the




                                              11
Case 1:16-cr-00091-JAW Document 66 Filed 03/22/17 Page 12 of 24            PageID #: 402



search of the residence that conflicted with her live testimony at the suppression

hearing. Compare Barry Interview at 1 (“Allen: Who else was in the residence at the

time we arrived? Barry: It was Forrest and Jenny came”), with Ctd. Suppression Tr.

8:4-8 (“Q: And to your knowledge, was anybody else home at the time? . . . A: There

was me and my son”).

      Nor does it make sense in the context of the law enforcement investigation that

the search would be limited to persons. The deputies were investigating a possible

gun crime. The complaint was about gun fire coming from the house at 184 Lakeview

Drive. By the time the deputies asked for permission to search the house, they had

learned: (1) that there was a shooting target in the back of the property, (2) that there

were shell casings in that area, (3) that both Ms. Barry and Mr. Gardiner were

convicted felons, (4) that there was an outstanding arrest warrant for Mr. Gardiner,

(5) that a male voice had come from inside the house, telling Ms. Barry not to let the

deputy into the house without a warrant, and (6) that someone appeared to run from

the rear of the house. Although the deputies may have been interested in finding Mr.

Gardiner to execute the arrest warrant, they were obviously also at least as interested

in whether there were firearms in the house. In this context, it is reasonable for the

Magistrate Judge to have found, as he did, that Ms. Barry’s consent was not limited

to a search of the house for persons.

      Having had the advantage of observing the witnesses during their testimony,

including direct, cross, and redirect examination, the Magistrate Judge credited the

truthfulness of the officers’ testimony as to whether Ms. Barry limited the consent of




                                              12
Case 1:16-cr-00091-JAW Document 66 Filed 03/22/17 Page 13 of 24          PageID #: 403



the search.       On this record, the Court finds no reason to doubt the officers’

truthfulness, nor any reason to doubt the Magistrate Judge’s ability to assess it. The

Court overrules Mr. Gardiner’s objection.

              3.      Questioning Ms. Barry about the Attic

      The Magistrate Judge stated in his recommended decision that “[w]hen the

officers pointed out their observations to Ms. Barry, and asked Ms. Barry whether

anyone was in the attic, she said no.” Rec. Dec. ¶ 18. He discusses this finding:

      Significantly, Ms. Barry could see the officers in the bedroom, was
      informed about the officers’ findings in the closet, was asked by the
      officers whether anyone was in the attic, yet did not raise any objections
      to the scope of the search. Logic suggests that had Ms. Barry limited
      the consent as Defendant maintains, she would have objected to the
      scope of the officers’ search.

Rec. Dec. at 6.

      Mr. Gardiner objects to this factual finding.     He states that Deputy Roy

testified that Ms. Barry was in the living room with her son while he was searching

the bedroom area and that Ms. Barry indicated that she could not see the closet area

from her location and could not see Deputy Roy accessing the attic. Def.’s Objs. at 2.

He also states that Deputy Roy did not testify that he sought permission or approval

from Ms. Barry or that he asked Ms. Barry about the attic before accessing it himself.

Id.

      Mr. Gardiner is correct that neither of the deputies, nor Ms. Barry, provided

any testimony during the suppression hearing concerning whether the officers

pointed out their observations about the attic to Ms. Barry or whether they asked her

if anyone was in the attic. See Suppression Tr. 30:11-33:20, 105:10-106:16, 115:20-



                                             13
Case 1:16-cr-00091-JAW Document 66 Filed 03/22/17 Page 14 of 24            PageID #: 404



117:12; Ctd. Suppression Tr. 16:7-21:23. However, Deputy Roy and Deputy Allen’s

reports, written the day after the incident, do reflect this fact. See Roy Report at 3

(“There was a 2’ x 2’ attic access panel above the closet that also had insulation debris

hanging out of it. It appeared the disturbance was recent. We then questioned

BARRY about this and she stated she did not know why anyone would have been up

there or used the attic space”); Allen Report at 2 (“We could see that the panel to the

attic also had insulation jammed into it. Deputy Roy and I pointed this out to Angela.

We asked her if anyone was in the attic. She told us that there was not”). Nothing

in the witnesses’ testimony at the hearing contradicted these facts from the reports.

The Court overrules Mr. Gardiner’s objection to the finding in paragraph 18.

      B.     Legal Objections

      Mr. Gardiner argues that the Magistrate Judge’s conclusion that “‘[l]ogic

suggests that had Ms. Barry limited the consent as Defendant maintains, she would

have objected to the scope of the officers’ search,’ is unsupported and clearly

erroneous.” Def.’s Objs. at 3. The Defendant also objects to the Magistrate Judge’s

legal conclusion that consent to search the residence includes the attic. Id. Finally,

the Defendant objects to the Magistrate Judge’s application of the inevitable

discovery doctrine to these facts. Id. at 4.

             1.     Search Not Limited in Scope

      The Fourth Amendment protects “the right of the people to be secure against

unreasonable searches and seizures of their persons, houses, papers and effects.”

United States v. Carrasco, 540 F.3d 43, 49 (1st Cir. 2008). “The Fourth Amendment

generally requires the police to obtain a warrant before entering and searching a


                                               14
Case 1:16-cr-00091-JAW Document 66 Filed 03/22/17 Page 15 of 24        PageID #: 405



person’s home.” United States v. Meada, 408 F.3d 14, 20 (1st Cir. 2005). As law

enforcement did not obtain a search warrant, the search of Mr. Gardiner’s home is

“presumptively unreasonable.” Michigan v. Fisher, 558 U.S. 45, 47 (2009) (quoting

Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U.S. 551, 559 (2004)). Nevertheless, the presumption “can be

overcome.” Id.

      One exception to the warrant requirement is consent. “It is a fundamental

principle of Fourth Amendment law that a warrantless search may be conducted with

the voluntary consent of a person authorized to give such consent.” United States v.

Chaney, 647 F.3d 401, 405–06 (1st Cir. 2011) (citing United States v. Stierhoff, 549

F.3d 19, 23 (1st Cir. 2008) (citing Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 222

(1973))). “‘Consent searches are part of the standard investigatory techniques of law

enforcement agencies’ and are ‘a constitutionally permissible and wholly legitimate

aspect of effective police activity.’” Fernandez v. California, 134 S. Ct. 1126, 1132

(2014) (quoting Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 231–32).

      However, a warrantless search may not exceed the scope of the consent

communicated by the consenting party. Chaney, 647 F.3d at 406. The scope of

consent is measured by an objective standard, i.e., what “the typical reasonable

person [would] have understood by the exchange between the officer and the suspect.”

Florida v. Jimeno, 500 U.S. 248, 251 (1991). “[Courts] therefore look beyond the

language of the consent itself, to the overall context, which necessarily encompasses

contemporaneous police statements and actions.” United States v. Marshall, 348 F.3d

281, 286–87 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting United States v. Melendez, 301 F.3d 27, 32 (1st




                                            15
Case 1:16-cr-00091-JAW Document 66 Filed 03/22/17 Page 16 of 24           PageID #: 406



Cir. 2002)). Consent may be “express or inferred from conduct,” also called “implied-

in-fact consent.” United States v. Winston, 444 F.3d 115, 121–22 (1st Cir. 2006).

       The Magistrate Judge concluded that the scope of Ms. Barry’s consent to search

the residence was not limited to persons and included the attic.         He based his

conclusion in part on Sergeant Sheehan’s testimony that the consent was not limited,

which he found to be more credible than Ms. Barry’s contrary testimony.

Additionally, the Magistrate Judge concluded that “had Ms. Barry limited the

consent as Defendant maintains, she would have objected to the scope of the officers’

search.” Rec. Dec. at 6.

       Mr. Gardiner argues that Ms. Barry was not aware of the actual search scope

and therefore her failure to object to the scope is evident:

       Ms. Barry was in the living room and had a limited vantage point to see
       what Roy was doing. She did not see him as he stood atop a stool and
       entered into the attic. Nor, did Roy notify her that he was doing so.
       Hence, she was in no position to have to have (sic) objected as she didn’t
       know what was happening. Roy only notified her after he removed the
       gun case from the attic.

Def.’s Objs. at 3.

       The Court disagrees with Mr. Gardiner that the scope of Ms. Barry’s consent

was limited. As already discussed, the Court accepts the Magistrate Judge’s finding

that Ms. Barry’s express consent was not limited to persons only. Moreover, even if

the scope of Ms. Barry’s express consent was limited to a search of the residence for

persons as Mr. Gardiner contends, the officers’ decision to search the attic would not

have exceeded that scope. Deputies Roy and Allen both testified that they believed

that someone may be hiding in the attic space, Suppression Tr. 31:3-5, 106:2-8, which



                                              16
Case 1:16-cr-00091-JAW Document 66 Filed 03/22/17 Page 17 of 24           PageID #: 407



is a reasonable belief given the insulation debris on the floor under the attic and

lodged in the panel.

      Additionally, the Court concludes that the scope of Ms. Barry’s consent to

search the residence extended to the attic. Mr. Gardiner argues that legally, consent

to search the residence does not include consent to search the attic. Def.’s Objs. at 3–

4. He points out that the First Circuit has not directly addressed the issue and

distinguishes the facts of this case from those in the cases relied upon by the

Magistrate Judge because here, the attic was not a living quarter and was not readily

accessible. Id.

      Although the First Circuit has not explicitly held that consent to search a

residence includes attics, the United States Supreme Court and the First Circuit have

established the general test for determining the scope of consent: what the typical

reasonable person would have understood by the exchange between the officer and

the suspect. Jimeno, 500 U.S. at 251; Chaney, 647 F.3d at 406. In the context of this

test, as the Magistrate Judge points out, courts have interpreted consent to search a

residence to include consent to search attached spaces, like basements and attics. J.

of the Ct. of Appeals for the First Circuit at 1, United States v. McCurdy, No. 06-cr-

80-JAW (D. Me. Nov. 16, 2010), ECF No. 218 (“There is also no clear error in the

district court’s finding that Sawtelle’s consent to the search of the attic was validly

inferred from her conduct”); United States v. Winston, 444 F.3d 115, 120–21 (1st Cir.

2006) (scope of protective sweep of basement deemed constitutional); see also United

States v. Comstock, 531 F.3d 667, 676 (8th Cir. 2008); United States v. Dominguez,




                                              17
Case 1:16-cr-00091-JAW Document 66 Filed 03/22/17 Page 18 of 24                         PageID #: 408



911 F. Supp. 261, 262–63 (S.D. Tex. 1995), aff’d, 103 F.3d 126 (5th Cir. 1996); United

States v. Jackson, 131 F.3d 1105, 1109 (4th Cir. 1997). Mr. Gardiner’s argument that

the facts of these cases are different is not persuasive. The attic in this case may not

have had stairs, but it was still readily accessible. The entrance was a two-by-two

pop panel and insulation was lodged into the panel, as well as present on the clothing

underneath, as if someone had recently accessed the space. Suppression Tr. 30:17-

31:11. All that Deputy Roy required to see into the attic was a chair. Id. 31:16-17.2

        Moreover, the fact that Ms. Barry’s consent extended to the attic can be implied

from her conduct.         As the Court already discussed, the evidence supports the

Magistrate Judge’s finding that the officers pointed out their observations about the

attic to Ms. Barry and asked her if anyone was in the attic, and she replied no. In

addition, Ms. Barry herself testified that she could see into the closet from the living

room where she was positioned. Ctd. Suppression Tr. 20:1-6. Although at one point

during the suppression hearing Ms. Barry testified that she was not aware that the

officers had accessed the attic area, id. 20:7-12, she testified shortly thereafter that

she did not remember if, at any point in time, she could see them accessing the attic.

Id. 21:18-23. Both Deputy Allen and Deputy Roy testified that Ms. Barry was in their

vicinity and could see them during the search of the attic but never objected.

Suppression Tr. 31:14-24, 33:5-20, 108:1-17, 115:20-116:12. Given the conduct of the

officers and Ms. Barry, as well as Ms. Barry’s express consent and failure to object



2       Additionally, albeit not exactly on point, the First Circuit has concluded that an attic was part
of the apartment in the context of a search warrant that read “30 Pekin Street, 2nd floor apartment
and basement.” United States v. Ferreras, 192 F.3d 5, 8, 10–11 (1st Cir. 1999).


                                                       18
Case 1:16-cr-00091-JAW Document 66 Filed 03/22/17 Page 19 of 24            PageID #: 409



during the search of the attic, the Court agrees with the Magistrate Judge that the

consent was not limited.

              2.     Inevitable Discovery Doctrine

       The Defendant also objects to the Magistrate Judge’s application of the

inevitable discovery doctrine to the facts of this case.        The Magistrate Judge

concluded that even if the consent was limited in scope, exclusion of the evidence

would not be warranted because the officers had probable cause to obtain a search

warrant and would have done so if consent had not been granted. Rec. Dec. at 7–8.

The Defendant argues that the inevitable discovery doctrine only applies when there

is “some actual evidence that pursuit of a warrant was active, ongoing, or even

initiated.” Def.’s Objs. at 4.

       In Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. 431 (1984), the United States Supreme Court

adopted the inevitable discovery doctrine as an exception to the exclusionary rule. Id.

at 448. The government bears the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of

the evidence that the evidence that was obtained by unlawful means would have been

inevitably secured in some other lawful way. Id. at 444. The First Circuit has

established a test to determine whether the inevitable discovery rule operates to bar

suppression of evidence: “(i) the lawful means of its discovery are independent and

would necessarily have been employed, (ii) discovery by that means is in fact

inevitable, and (iii) application of the doctrine in a particular case will not sully the

prophylaxis of the Fourth Amendment.” United States v. Zapata, 18 F.3d 971, 978

(1st Cir. 1994).




                                              19
Case 1:16-cr-00091-JAW Document 66 Filed 03/22/17 Page 20 of 24                          PageID #: 410



        In the context of search warrants, the First Circuit has explicitly rejected Mr.

Gardiner’s “ongoing” test in favor of a more flexible analysis. See United States v.

Silvestri, 787 F.2d 736, 746 (1st Cir. 1986). At the same time, the Silvestri Court

suggested that where a warrant is never obtained, as is the case here, the doctrine

may require active pursuit of the alternative investigation to be underway. Id.

Ultimately, the Silvestri Court found that even though the search warrant process

was not initiated at the time of the unlawful search, because the search warrant was

obtained afterwards, the tainted evidence inevitably would have been discovered. Id.

        Since Silvestri, the First Circuit has addressed the application of the inevitable

discovery doctrine in the context of search warrants in at least two other cases:

United States v. Hughes, 640 F.3d 428 (1st Cir. 2011) and United States v. Jadlowe,

628 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2010). In both of these cases, although the officers did not have

a search warrant at the time of the search, they eventually sought and obtained

warrants, and the First Circuit concluded that the district court properly applied the

inevitable discovery doctrine. See Jadlowe, 628 F.3d at 7, 12; Hughes, 640 F.3d at

440–41.3

        Mr. Gardiner’s case is a harder one because no search warrant was ever sought

or obtained. In Silvestri, the First Circuit distinguished between those cases in which




3       In 1991, a judge from this District extended the Silvestri case and applied the inevitable
discovery doctrine to a situation in which an officer had probable cause and could have gotten a
warrant but did not. United States v. Thurston, 774 F. Supp. 666, 668–69 (D. Me. 1991). Other district
courts in this Circuit have reached the opposite conclusion, reasoning that the fact that an officer could
have obtained a warrant is too speculative and would weaken the Fourth Amendment’s protections.
See United States v. Torres, 274 F. Supp. 2d 146, 162–63 (D.R.I. 2003); United States v. Matthews, No.
05-10073-NG, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7701, at *23–24 (D. Mass. Mar. 1, 2006).


                                                       20
Case 1:16-cr-00091-JAW Document 66 Filed 03/22/17 Page 21 of 24         PageID #: 411



a search warrant is eventually obtained and those in which a search warrant is never

obtained:

      [T]he application of the inevitable discovery rule where no warrant is in
      fact obtained would substitute proof by a preponderance of the evidence
      that a warrant could and would have been obtained for the requirement
      of the fourth amendment that a warrant must in fact be obtained
      through a neutral and detached magistrate prior to a search. Such an
      approach substantially weakens the protection provided by the fourth
      amendment.
      ...
      The stakes are somewhat different in cases where a warrant has been
      obtained subsequent to the illegal search. The fact that a warrant has
      been obtained removes speculation as to whether a magistrate would in
      fact have issued a warrant on the facts and also ensures us that the
      fourth amendment has not been totally circumvented.

Silvestri, 787 F.2d at 744–45.

      Here, the absence of a search warrant raises the puzzling question of whether

the officers would have done something they wrongly thought they did not need to do.

Here, the officers testified that they would have sought a search warrant had Ms.

Barry not given them consent to search the property. Suppression Tr. 49:16-55:18.

The Magistrate Judge credited the officers’ testimony, noting that the nature of the

investigation and the fact that there were three law enforcement officers on site

supported the fact that the officers would have secured the property and requested a

search warrant had they not received consent. Rec. Dec. at 8. The Magistrate Judge

also concluded that given all of the facts known to the officers when they obtained

consent, there would have been sufficient probable cause in support of the search

warrant. Id. Specifically, the Magistrate Judge noted:

      When they obtained consent for the search, the officers had received a
      report that shots had been fired on the property; the officers knew that



                                            21
Case 1:16-cr-00091-JAW Document 66 Filed 03/22/17 Page 22 of 24          PageID #: 412



       Defendant and Ms. Barry, occupants of the home, were convicted felons
       and thus prohibited from possessing firearms; the officers had located a
       shooting target area on the property; the officers found empty shell
       casings on the property; the officers were aware there was an
       outstanding warrant for Defendant’s arrest; one of the officers heard a
       male voice in the house despite Ms. Barry’s assertion that Defendant
       was not present; and the officers observed at least one person flee from
       the house.

Id.

       The Court concurs with the Magistrate Judge that the Government satisfied

the first two elements of the Zapata test. In the circumstances of this case, where

the deputies were concerned that one or two of the residents had unlawfully possessed

and perhaps shot a firearm and had sufficient facts to establish probable cause in

support of a search warrant, it is highly unlikely that they would have just walked

away without attempting to secure a search warrant to determine whether there were

firearms in the house, or that they would have deliberately conducted an illegal

warrantless search and risked having all of the evidence excluded. Therefore, “(i) the

lawful means of discovery are independent and would necessarily have been

employed, [and] (ii) discovery by that means is in fact inevitable.” Zapata, 18 F.3d at

978.

       This leaves the third element—whether “application of the doctrine in a

particular case will not sully the prophylaxis of the Fourth Amendment.” Id. This is

a most serious concern. The right of the people to be secure against unreasonable

searches guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment is among the most fundamental and

important rights in the Bill of Rights, and central to the protections of the Fourth

Amendment is the warrant requirement. Mincey v. Arizona , 437 U.S. 385, 390 (1978)



                                             22
Case 1:16-cr-00091-JAW Document 66 Filed 03/22/17 Page 23 of 24             PageID #: 413



(“[I]t is a cardinal principle that ‘searches conducted outside the judicial process,

without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are per se unreasonable under the

Fourth Amendment—subject only to a few specifically established and well-

delineated exceptions’”) (quoting Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 357 (1967)); Ker

v. State of California, 374 U.S. 23, 32 (1963) (“Implicit in the Fourth Amendment's

protection from unreasonable searches and seizures is its recognition of individual

freedom.    That safeguard has been declared to be as of the very essence of

constitutional liberty the guaranty of which is as important and as imperative as are

the guaranties of the other fundamental rights of the individual citizen”) (quotations

omitted). Taken to an extreme, the inevitable discovery exception could subsume the

warrant requirement, making the exception the rule, and eroding the rights

guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment. See Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10,

14 (1948) (“Any assumption that evidence sufficient to support a magistrate's

disinterested determination to issue a search warrant will justify the officers in

making a search without a warrant would reduce the Amendment to a nullity and

leave the people's homes secure only in the discretion of police officers . . . When the

right of privacy must reasonably yield to the right of search is, as a rule, to be decided

by a judicial officer, not by a policeman or Government enforcement agent”).

      In the circumstances of this particular case, the Court concludes that there is

not a danger that the doctrine’s application will “provide an incentive for police

misconduct or significantly weaken fourth amendment protections.” Silvestri, 787

F.2d at 744. The Magistrate Judge found that the officers received consent to search




                                               23
Case 1:16-cr-00091-JAW Document 66 Filed 03/22/17 Page 24 of 24         PageID #: 414



from Ms. Barry and relied upon that consent in making the decision not to obtain a

search warrant.   They did not purposefully circumvent the Fourth Amendment.

Carrasco, 540 F.3d at 49 (“[S]o long as law enforcement officers reasonably believe

that the person who gives consent has the authority to do so, they may rely on that

consent”). The situation would be starkly different if the officers illegally searched

the home and sought to justify an otherwise illegal search by claiming that they could

have and would have sought and obtained a search warrant all along.

IV.   CONCLUSION

      The Court concludes that the warrantless search and seizure was valid under

the Fourth Amendment. The Court AFFIRMS the Magistrate Judge’s Recommended

Decision on the Motion to Suppress (ECF No. 59) for the reasons set forth in that

decision as further explained here. The Court DENIES Mr. Gardiner’s Motion to

Suppress (ECF No. 30).
