United States Court of Appeals
For the First Circuit

 

NO. 06-2404
UNITED STATES,
Appellee,
v.
JOSE TORRADO,

Defendant, Appellant.

 

Before

Boudin, Chief Judge,
Torruella and Lynch, Circuit Judges.

 

JUDGMENT
Entered: September 17, 2007

In this sentencing appeal, defendant argues that the district
court erred in finding him responsible for at least 100 grams of
heroin. We discern no clear error in the district court's drug
quantity determination. Specifically, we reject defendant's
contention that the record does not adequately support the district
court's conclusion that defendant was responsible for two 50-gram
heroin transactions in September 2004. We also reject defendant's
contention that the district court erred in crediting the grand
jury testimony of two drug customers.

The government's motion for summary disposition is granted.
The judgment of the district court is affirmed. See lst Cir. R.
27.0(c).
By the Court:

Richard Cushing Donovan, Clerk.
