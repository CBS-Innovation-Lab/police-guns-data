               RECOMMENDED DECISION ON 28 U.S.C. § 2255 MOTION

       Defendant Matthew W. Brooks has filed a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his

sentence, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §2255. (Motion, ECF No. 41.) He was sentenced in 2003 after

he pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of firearms and ammunition, in violation of 18

U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1), 924(e). He argues that the sentencing court erroneously classified him as

an armed career criminal. I have screened Brooks’s claims, pursuant to Rule 4(b) of the Rules

Governing Section 2255 Proceedings, and recommend that the court summarily dismiss the

motion without requiring the government to file an answer, because Brooks’s motion is

untimely.

                                  Facts and Procedural History

       Brooks was indicted in March 2003 on three counts for being a felon in possession of

firearms (counts one and two) and ammunition (count three). (Indictment, ECF No. 11.) In

support of the allegation that Brooks is a convicted felon, the indictment lists five state

convictions that occurred between 1990 and 1998 in Massachusetts. These include two drug

crimes, one for possession and another for distribution near a school or park; assault and battery
Case 1:03-cr-00020-GZS Document 42 Filed 11/05/13 Page 2 of 7                        PageID #: 107



on a police officer; breaking and entering in the night with intent to commit a felony; and assault

by use of a dangerous weapon. In July 2003, Brooks pleaded guilty to all three counts of the

felon-in-possession indictment, pursuant to a plea agreement. (ECF No. 29.) The signed plea

agreement states, among other things, that “[t]he parties further agree and understand that the

maximum statutory penalty that may be imposed upon conviction on each of Counts One, Two

and Three of the Indictment is imprisonment of not less than 15 years or more than life . . . .”

(Plea Agreement at 1, ECF No. 28.) In November 2003, Brooks was convicted and sentenced to

fifteen years (180 months) of imprisonment on each of the three counts, to be served

concurrently, followed by three years of supervised release on each of the counts, to be served

concurrently. (Judgment, ECF No. 33.)

       Brooks, acting pro se, filed a notice of appeal in October 2004. The First Circuit issued a

mandate dismissing the appeal as untimely. (Mandate, ECF No. 39.)

       In October 2013, Brooks filed a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §2255. He attacks three of

his five prior state convictions listed in the 2003 indictment, in an effort to fall below the

minimum three previous convictions required under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. §

924(e)(1), for the imposition of an enhanced fifteen-year sentence. Two of these are the drug

convictions, which he argues were improperly considered “serious drug offenses,” as that term is

defined under section 924(e)(2)(A), for purposes of his 2003 sentencing on the felon-in-

possession offenses. He asserts that because he was prosecuted in the state’s District Court, the

maximum term of imprisonment was limited to two and one half years. Because section

924(e)(2)(A) provides that to qualify as a “serious drug offense,” a maximum sentence of ten

years or more must have been imposed, and the two prior drug convictions carried lesser

sentences, neither of them qualifies. Brooks cites Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, 560 U.S. 563



                                                   2

(2010), and other cases in support. The third prior conviction he attacks is the one for assault

and battery on a police officer, which he argues should not be considered a “violent felony,”

pursuant to section 924(e)(2)(B). He asserts that the First Circuit recently held that a

Massachusetts assault conviction cannot categorically be considered a “violent felony” under

section 924(e)(2)(B). Finally, Brooks cites to Alleyne v. United States, 133 S. Ct. 2151 (2013),

arguing that facts found in support of an enhanced sentence under the Armed Career Criminal

Act must be decided by the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt.

                                            Discussion

       The statute of limitations for post-conviction petitions is set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f),

which provides:

       A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a motion under this section. The
       limitation period shall run from the latest of―

               (1) the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final;

               (2) the date on which the impediment to making a motion created by
                   governmental action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the
                   United States is removed, if the movant was prevented from making a
                   motion by such governmental action;

               (3) the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the
                   Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the
                   Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral
                   review; or

               (4) the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented
                   could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.

See Turner v. United States, 699 F.3d 578, 582 (1st Cir. 2012).

       Brooks’s judgment became final on November 17, 2003, which was ten days after the

judgment was entered, pursuant to the version of Fed. R. App. P. 4(b)(1)(A) then applicable.

Although the First Circuit apparently has not yet decided the issue of when an unappealed

Case 1:03-cr-00020-GZS Document 42 Filed 11/05/13 Page 4 of 7                       PageID #: 109



judgment is final, the Second Circuit has held that “an unappealed federal criminal judgment

becomes final when the time for filing a direct appeal expires.” Moshier v. United States, 402

F.3d 116, 118 (2d Cir.2005); see also Martinez–Serrano v. United States, 3:11-cv-01077-JAF,

3:07-cr-00453-JAF-9, 2012 WL 6016663, at *1, 2012 U.S. Dist. Lexis 171941, at *3-5 (D.P.R.

Nov.30, 2012) (collecting cases and noting that although the Supreme Court and the First Circuit

had apparently not yet decided the issue, most if not all other circuit courts that have addressed

the issue have held that an unappealed federal criminal conviction is final when the time for

filing an appeal expires); but see Mendoza-Miguel v. United States, 7:10-cv-00205-BO; 7:08-cr-

00127-BO-1, 2010 WL 5353970, at *1-2, 2010 U.S. Dist. Lexis 135077, at *3-4 (E.D.N.C. Dec.

21, 2000) (collecting cases and noting that circuit courts are split, citing United States v. Sanders,

247 F.3d 139, 142 (4th Cir.2001) (holding that an unappealed judgment of conviction becomes

final on the date the district court enters judgment)). Of course, either way, his motion is

untimely under section 2255(f)(1).

       Brooks relies on Carachuri-Rosendo to challenge his prior drug convictions. (Motion at

3.) Carachuri-Rosendo was decided on June 14, 2010. 560 U.S. 563. Brooks did not file his

collateral attack until October 17, 2013, i.e., more than one year after “the date on which the

right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court,” and therefore after the limitations

period set forth in section 2255 (f)(3). I need not address whether the Court’s holding in

Carachuri-Rosendo is applicable at all or whether that case is retroactively applicable to cases on

collateral review. See United States v. Odom, No. 2:08-cr-67-DBH-05, 2013 WL 2435915, *2

n.7, 2013 U.S. Dist. Lexis 79191, *6 n. 7 (D. Me. June 4, 2013).

       To the extent Brooks challenges the determination that his conviction for assault and

battery on a police officer constituted a conviction for a “violent felony” as that term is defined



                                                  4
Case 1:03-cr-00020-GZS Document 42 Filed 11/05/13 Page 5 of 7                                       PageID #: 110



in 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B), that argument is also unavailing. Although Brooks does not name

the recent case on which he relies, he states that the First Circuit has held that a Massachusetts

conviction for assault does not qualify as a “violent felony” for purposes of sentencing under the

Armed Career Criminal Act. He may be referring to United States v. Holloway, 630 F.3d 252,

262 (1st Cir. 2011) (“In sum, because the Massachusetts simple assault and battery statute covers

multiple offenses, at least one of which, reckless battery, is categorically not a violent felony, a

court may only rely on an assault and battery conviction if it can ascertain that the defendant was

convicted of the violent form of the offense (e.g., harmful battery).”).

         In order to trigger the limitations period set forth in 28 U.S.C. §2255(f)(3), the applicable

precedent must be newly recognized by the Supreme Court; new case law from the First Circuit

does not provide grounds to trigger the start of a new limitations period under section 2255(f)(3).

See Dodd v. United States, 545 U.S. 353, 357-59 (2005) (holding that section 2255(f)(3)

“unequivocally identifies one, and only one, date from which the 1-year limitation period is

measured: ‘the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme

Court’”). Thus, new First Circuit precedent would not help Brooks, even if he had filed his

petition within a year of the publication of a favorable First Circuit opinion. 1

         To the extent Brooks relies on Alleyne, that case is not applicable. The Supreme Court’s

holding in Alleyne is an extension of its holding in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 477

(2000). As the plurality explained in Alleyne, the Court held in Apprendi that “any fact that

increased the prescribed statutory maximum sentence must be an ‘element’ of the offense to be

found by the jury.” Alleyne, 133 S. Ct. at 2157 (emphasis added) (citing Apprendi, 530 U.S. at

1
         Incidentally, there is additional First Circuit precedent that is not in Brooks’s favor. See United States v.
Dancy, 640 F.3d 455, 468-70 (1st Cir. 2011) (holding that a Massachusetts conviction for assault and battery on a
police officer qualifies as a “violent felony” and hence a predicate offense under section 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), for
purposes of enhanced sentencing of not less than fifteen years, pursuant to section 924(e)(1)), cert. denied, 132 S.
Ct. 564 (2011).

                                                           5
Case 1:03-cr-00020-GZS Document 42 Filed 11/05/13 Page 6 of 7                        PageID #: 111



483, n.10, 490). In Alleyne, reasoning from Apprendi, the Supreme Court held that because

mandatory minimum sentences increase the penalty for a crime, “any fact that increases the

mandatory minimum is an ‘element’ that must be submitted to the jury.” Id. at 2155. However,

there is no current authority for the proposition that Alleyne applies to the fact of prior

convictions: “Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a

crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond

a reasonable doubt.” Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 490. In other words, the existence or not of a prior

conviction is not a fact that must be submitted to a jury. Id.

       Furthermore, by pleading guilty, Brooks admitted the facts set forth in the indictment,

which include the convictions that are the subject of his section 2255 motion. Even in his current

motion he does not deny that he was convicted of these offenses; his arguments pertain to the

legal significance of the offenses, not the fact of conviction. He does not dispute that his plea

was knowing and voluntary. When the defendant pleads guilty to facts that support a sentence in

excess of the statutory maximum, those facts need not be proved to a jury. See United States v.

Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 244 (2005) (“Any fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary

to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of

guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a

reasonable doubt.”) (emphasis added); United States v. Wilson, 185 F. App’x 6, 8 (1st Cir.

2006). There is no reason why the same rationale would not apply to a prior conviction which is

necessary to support a mandatory minimum sentence as well.

                                             Conclusion

       For the reasons stated above, I conclude that no evidentiary hearing is warranted under

Rule 8 of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Cases and I recommend that the Court deny

Brooks’s motion for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. I further recommend that the Court

deny a certificate of appealability pursuant to Rule 11 of the Rules Governing Section 2255

Cases because there is no substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right within the

meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).
