                       GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO
              DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR REDUCTION OF SENTENCE
                      PURSUANT TO 18 U.S.C. §3582(c)(2)


I.       TRAVEL OF THE CASE

         The Defendant was arrested on September 6, 2006 and indicted on September 13, 2006,

on four counts that charged him with possession of cocaine and cocaine base (crack cocaine)

with the intent to distribute, possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime and

possessing a firearm after having been convicted of a felony. On December 18, 2006, the facts

of this case were presented to the Court during a motion to suppress, which the Court denied.

The Defendant pled guilty on January 19, 2007 and was sentenced on March 30, 2007, on

Counts One through three to the statutory mandatory minimum of sixty months concurrently,

and as to Count four, the statutory mandatory minimum of sixty months consecutive.

II.      FACTS

         At approximately 1 a.m. on September 6, 2006, Warwick Police Sgt. Rathbun, in a

police cruiser, was monitoring traffic on West Shore Road when he noticed that a vehicle,

driven by the defendant, had a flat left front tire. Sgt. Rathbun activated the police cruiser’s

lights and traveling at speeds up to 50 miles an hour was initially unable to pull the Defendant


                                                 1

over. Rathbun turned on the police siren and the defendant’s vehicle swerved over into the

oncoming lane and made an abrupt U-turn, pulling into the Defendant’s yard. The Defendant

got out of his car and began walking towards the building. The officer suspected that the

Defendant was under the influence of either drugs or alcohol and told the Defendant to return to

his car. The Sgt. had to repeat the command twice before the Defendant complied. The

Defendant was extremely nervous; visibly shaking. During the Terry frisk, Rathbun retrieved a

fully loaded firearm with a round in the chamber. A search of the Defendant’s vehicle revealed

approximately 160 grams of marijuana, along with 14.56 grams of crack cocaine and 12.06

grams of a mixture of both powder and crack cocaine inside a prescription bottle. A make shift

crack pipe was located, as well as two digital scales. Also located were various prescription

medication bottles in other people’s names, a bottle of Dewar’s scotch, and prescription bottles

in Miguel Pavao’s name.

III.   ARGUMENT

       The guideline range for sentencing as calculated the United States Sentencing Guidelines

(U.S.S.G.) was 57 to 71 months, given the Defendant’s Criminal History Category of III.

However, due to the statutory mandatory minimum in Count One, the restricted range was 60 to

71 months and on Count Four the statute mandated that the mandatory minimum sentence of 60

months be imposed consecutively. Therefore, the U.S.S.G. range on counts One through Three

was 60 to 71 months and the statute required that the 60 months on Count Four be imposed

consecutively. Thus, a mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months resulted. Although the

Defendant was eligible for a sentencing enhancement information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. §851,

the government did not file one. If it had, the Defendant would have faced a statutory


                                                2

mandatory minimum sentence of 180 months or 15 years.

A.      The Defendant Is Not Eligible For A Reduced Sentence Because the Amendment Did
        Not Reduce His Guideline Range

        The Defendant seeks a reduction in his sentence based on U.S.S.G. §1B1.10(c) and

Kimbrough v. United States, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) and Gall v. United States,

128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Amendment 706 to the United States Sentencing

Commission Guidelines reduced the base offense level listed on the drug quantity table set forth

at U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c) for most cocaine base (crack) offenses. The Defendant is not eligible for

a reduced sentence because his guideline imprisonment range was set by the statutory minimum

penalty, which has not been changed.

        Once a term of imprisonment has been imposed, the Court may not modify it except in

very limited, specified circumstances. See 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c); Fed.R.Crim.P. 35. The

circumstance at issue here arises under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2), which provides that:


               in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of
               imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently
               been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28
               U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the
               Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the
               term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in
               section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a
               reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by
               the Sentencing Commission.

        The principal policy statement issued by the Sentencing Commission is U.S.S.G.

§1B1.10(c), which lists the guideline amendments which may be applied retroactively pursuant

to Section 3582(c)1 and sets forth how such amendments are to be implemented in a concluded

case.2

         Amendment 706 became effective November 1, 2007.3 On December 11, 2007, the

Commission added Amendment 706 to the list of amendments stated in Section 1B1.10(c)

which may be applied retroactively, effective March 3, 2008.

         Amendment 706 generally reduced by two the offense levels applicable to crack cocaine

offenses. The Commission determined that the two level reduction would ameliorate the

problems it ascribes to the 100:1 ratio between quantities of cocaine and crack giving rise to

statutory mandatory minimum penalties, while still respecting those statutory penalties by

assigning base offense levels that correspond to guideline imprisonment ranges that include the

         The amendments that apply retroactively also are spelled out in Appendix C to the
Sentencing Guidelines.
         2
           Section 1B1.10 is based on 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2), and also implements 28 U.S.C. §
994(u), which provides: “If the Commission reduces the term of imprisonment recommended in
the guidelines applicable to a particular offense or category of offenses, it shall specify in what
circumstances and by what amount the sentences of prisoners serving terms of imprisonment for
the offense may be reduced.”
        A guideline amendment may be applied retroactively only when expressly listed in Section
1B1.10(c). See, e.g., United States v. Perez, 129 F.3d 255, 259 (2d Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 525 U.S.
953 (1998). See also, e.g., United States v. McHan, 386 F.3d 620, 622 (4th Cir. 2004); United States
v. Armstrong, 347 F.3d 905, 909 (11th Cir. 2003); United States v. Wyatt, 115 F.3d 606, 608-09 (8th
Cir. 1997); United States v. Drath, 89 F.3d 216, 218 (5th Cir. 1996); United States v. Thompson, 70
F.3d 279, 281 (3d Cir. 1995); United States v. Dullen, 15 F.3d 68, 70-71 (6th Cir. 1994); United
States v. Cueto, 9 F.3d 1438, 1441 (9th Cir. 1993); United States v. Avila, 997 F.2d 767, 768 (10th
Cir. 1993).
         3
      Amendment 711, also effective November 1, 2007, made technical and conforming
amendments to Amendment 706, and likewise was made retroactive (effective March 3, 2008).

statutory minimum imprisonment term. See U.S.S.G., Supplement to App. C, Amend. 706.4

Before Amendment 706, base offense levels listed at U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c) for statutory threshold

crack quantities called for guideline imprisonment ranges beginning just above the mandatory

minimum term of imprisonment, assuming a criminal history category of I and no downward

adjustments in reaching the total offense level. For example, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B)

prescribes a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of five years imprisonment for distributing

five or more grams of crack cocaine. Before the amendment, the corresponding base offense

level was 26, which yielded a guideline imprisonment range of 63 - 78 months at criminal

history category I. The revised guideline sets the corresponding base offense level at 24 and the

imprisonment range at 51 - 63 months.

       Also on December 11, 2007, the Commission issued a revised version of U.S.S.G. §

1B1.10, which emphasizes the limited nature of relief available under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c).

Revised Section 1B1.10, which became effective on March 3, 2008, provides:

               (a) Authority. ––
               (1) In General.— In a case in which a defendant is serving a term
               of imprisonment, and the guideline range applicable to that
               defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an
               amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in subsection (c)
               below, the court may reduce the defendant’s term of
               imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). As required
               by 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2), any such reduction in the defendant’s
               term of imprisonment shall be consistent with this policy
               statement.
               (2) Exclusions.—A reduction in the defendant’s term of

          In a separate matter, the Supreme Court recently held in Kimbrough v. United States,
128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) that district courts “may consider the Guidelines’
treatment of crack and powder cocaine offenses” in deciding whether to vary from the advisory
Guidelines range for crack offenders. However, that issue is not pertinent to this case, which
involves only a § 3582(c)(2) reduction based on a specific guideline amendment.

          imprisonment is not consistent with this policy statement and
          therefore is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) if—
          (A) none of the amendments listed in subsection (c) is applicable
          to the defendant; or
          (B) an amendment listed in subsection (c) does not have the effect
          of lowering the defendant’s applicable guideline range.
          (3) Limitation.—Consistent with subsection (b), proceedings
          under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement do not
          constitute a full resentencing of the defendant.

          (b) Determination of Reduction in Term of Imprisonment.—
          (1) In General.—In determining whether, and to what extent, a
          reduction in the defendant’s term of imprisonment under 18
          U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement is warranted, the
          court shall determine the amended guideline range that would
          have been applicable to the defendant if the amendment(s) to the
          guidelines listed in subsection (c) had been in effect at the time
          the defendant was sentenced. In making such determination, the
          court shall substitute only the amendments listed in subsection (c)
          for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when
          the defendant was sentenced and shall leave all other guideline
          application decisions unaffected.
          (2) Limitations and Prohibition on Extent of Reduction.—
          (A) In General.—Except as provided in subdivision (B), the court
          shall not reduce the defendant’s term of imprisonment under 18
          U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less
          than the minimum of the amended guideline range determined
          under subdivision (1).
          (B) Exception.—If the original term of imprisonment imposed
          was less than the term of imprisonment provided by the guideline
          range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing, a
          reduction
          comparably less than the amended guideline range determined
          under subdivision (1) may be appropriate. However, if the original
          term of imprisonment constituted a non-guideline sentence
          determined pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) and United States v.
          Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), a further reduction generally would
          not be appropriate.
          (C) Prohibition.—In no event may the reduced term of
          imprisonment be less than the term of imprisonment the defendant
          has already served.

   By their express terms, both 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c) and U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10 permit

reduction of a Defendant’s sentence only if the Defendant’s guideline imprisonment range has

been lowered by a subsequent guidelines amendment. That condition precedent is not met

where, as here, the Defendant’s guideline imprisonment range was not derived from the drug

quantity table that was amended, but from the applicable statutory minimum, which remains

unchanged.

       The defendant was held accountable for 14.56 grams of cocaine base or crack cocaine,

subjecting him to the statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment prescribed by 21

U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B). That statutory minimum term of imprisonment was greater than the

guideline imprisonment range that would otherwise have applied, so it was the Defendant’s

guideline sentence, pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 5G1.1(b). See, e.g., United States v. Richardson, —

F.3d —, 2008 WL 398969 *8 (2nd Cir. Feb. 15, 2008). Section 5G1.1(b) provides that:

               Where a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the
               maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily
               required minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.

The statutory minimum “subsumes and displaces the otherwise applicable guideline range.”

United States v. Cordero, 313 F.3d 161, 166 (3rd Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 990 (2003).

       The statutory minimum term of imprisonment remains the benchmark and reference

point for the Defendant’s sentence today. That statutory minimum has not been changed since

the Defendant was originally sentenced. The amendment of the offense levels applicable to

crimes involving crack thus does not change the guideline range applicable to the Defendant. If

the Court determined the guideline range “that would have been applicable to the defendant if

the amendment(s) to the guidelines . . . had been in effect at the time the defendant was

sentenced,” as instructed by U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10, the Defendant’s sentence would be unchanged.

   Case 1:06-cr-00096-ML-LDA            Document 36        Filed 04/28/2008       Page 8 of 11



The Defendant’s guideline sentence still is determined by the statutory minimum term of

imprisonment, per U.S.S.G. § 5G1.1(b), not by reference to the drug quantity table. Because

the amendment to the drug quantity table did not lower the Defendant’s guideline sentence, he is

not eligible for a reduction. See United States v. Mueller, 27 F.3d 494 (10th Cir. 1994). See also

United States v. Young, 247 F.3d 1247, 1254 (D.C. Cir. 2001)(Section 3582(c) did not authorize

a sentencing reduction when Defendant’s offense level was calculated in a way unaffected by

the guideline amendment); United States v. Townsend, 98 F.3d 510, 513 (9th Cir. 1996)(no

reduction where amendment did. not affect Defendant’s guideline range).

       In Mueller, the Defendant pled guilty to distributing more than one gram of LSD, and

thus was subject to a statutory minimum term of imprisonment of 60 months. 27 F.3d at 495.

The government moved for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1 and then under

Fed.R.Crim.P. 35, and the defendant was sentenced to be imprisoned for 39 months. Id. When

the guideline for determining the weight of LSD was changed, the defendant sought a reduced

sentence based on the new guideline. Id. The Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s

conclusion that the defendant was not entitled to a reduction because he had been subject to the

mandatory minimum sentence at the time of his sentencing, so his guideline sentence still would

have been 60 months, not the 18 - 24 month range to which the otherwise applicable LSD

guideline imprisonment term had bee reduced. Id. at 495-97.

       The Defendant is simply not one “who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment

based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing

Commission,” as is required by 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c) to be eligible for a reduction. As U.S.S.G.

§ 1B1.10(a)(2) spells out, since Amendment 706 did not have the effect of lowering the


                                                 8
   Case 1:06-cr-00096-ML-LDA           Document 36         Filed 04/28/2008       Page 9 of 11



Defendant’s guideline sentence, a reduction is not authorized.

  B. The Defendant Is Not Eligible For Further Reduction Unrelated to Substantial Assistance

       As set forth above, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e) permits a downward departure from a statutory

minimum sentence, upon motion of the United States, “so as to reflect a defendant’s substantial

assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.”

The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit recently spelled out that “any reduction may be

based only on substantial assistance to the government and on no other mitigating

considerations.” United States v. Richardson, — F.3d —, 2008 WL 398969 *8 (2nd Cir. Feb.

15, 2008). See also, e.g., United v. Williams, 474 F.3d 1130, 1131 (8th Cir. 2007)(“Where a

court has authority to sentence below a statutory minimum only by virtue of a government

motion under § 3553(e), the reduction below the statutory minimum must be based exclusively

on assistance-related considerations.”); United States v. Auld, 321 F.3d 861, 867 (9th Cir.

2003)(in departing under § 3553(e), the court “may not . . . consider factors unrelated to the

defendant’s assistance.”)(collecting cases). The amendment of guideline base offense levels for

crack offenses obviously is unrelated to the Defendant’s substantial assistance, and thus may not

be the basis for reducing the defendant’s sentence.

                                       IV. CONCLUSION

          For the foregoing reasons, the Defendant’s motion for a reduced sentence must be

denied.
