                  ORDER AFFIRMING THE
       RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE

        The United States Magistrate Judge filed with the Court on May 11,

  2015 his Recommended Decision (ECF No. 82).        The Petitioner filed his

  objections to the Recommended Decision on May 26, 2015 (ECF No. 83). The

  Respondent filed its response to the objections on August 19, 2015 (ECF No.

  90). I have reviewed and considered the Magistrate Judge’s Recommended

  Decision, together with the entire record; I have made a de novo

  determination of all matters adjudicated by the Magistrate Judge’s

  Recommended Decision; and I concur with the recommendations of the

  United States Magistrate Judge for the reasons set forth in his

  Recommended Decision, and determine that no further proceeding is

  necessary.

        1. It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision
           (ECF No. 82) of the Magistrate Judge be and hereby is
           AFFIRMED.

        2. Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that the Petitioner’s 28 U.S. C.

           § 2255 Motion (ECF No. 71) be and hereby is DENIED. It is
           further ORDERED that no certificate of appealability should issue
           in the event the Petitioner files a notice of appeal because there is
           no substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right within
           the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).

  SO ORDERED.
