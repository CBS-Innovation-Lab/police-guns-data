                        UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

                          DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

      v.                                   Criminal No. 07-cr-206-1-SM

Agustin H. Sanchez


                                   O R D E R


      Defendant has written a letter to the court, dated May 4,

2010, in which he seeks the appointment of counsel “to assist

. . . in determining if there is a basis for my seeking a

sentence reduction.”        The letter shall be docketed as a motion

for appointment of counsel.

      The letter does not appear to constitute a petition for

relief under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 2255, and is not

construed as such.

      The request for appointment of counsel is denied.



      SO ORDERED.



                                      ____________________________
