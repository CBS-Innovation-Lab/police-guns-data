                    UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                         DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

               v.                            Case No. 05-cr-237-01-SM

Christopher D. Mann

                                     ORDER

      Defendant Mann’s motion to continue the final pretrial conference and trial

is granted (document 7). Trial has been rescheduled for the April 2006 trial

period. Defendant Mann shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights not later than

December 21, 2005. On the filing of such waiver, his continuance shall be

effective.

      The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18

U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would

unreasonably deny defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances.

      Final Pretrial Conference: March 23, 2006 at 2:00 p.m.

      Jury Selection: April 4, 2006 at 9:30 a.m.
