              UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                      DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America,
     Plaintiff

            v.
                                       Case No.    12-cr-103-01-SM

Robert Brackett,
     Defendant

                               O R D E R


     Defendant Brackett’s Assented-to Motion to Continue the

final pretrial conference and trial to a date no earlier than

February 20, 2013 (document no. 16).        Trial has been

rescheduled for the month of March 2013.        Defendant Brackett

shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights on December 7, 2013.

     The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting

a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A) and (B),

in that failure to grant a continuance would unreasonably deny

the defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence

under the circumstances.

     Final Pretrial Conference is rescheduled for March 8, 2013

at 10:30 a.m.

     Jury selection will take place on March 19, 2013 at

9:30 a.m.
