 DEFENDANTâ€™S MOTION REQUESTING ORDER TO BUREAU OF PRISONS
                              TO TRANSPORT DEFENDANT


       Now comes the Defendant through his undersigned attorneys and requests that the
Court order the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) honor a writ of habeus corpus ad prosequendum
issued by the Lowell District Court requesting the Defendant be transported to Lowell for
trial on February 12, 2008.
       The Defendant was charged as a Felon in Possession of Firearm and Ammunition
under 18 U.S.C. sec. 922(g)(1). After pleading guilty the Defendant was sentenced to180
months. The Defendant is presently serving his sentence at FMC Devens (Federal
Medical Center, PO Box 879, Ayer, MA 01432).
       Shortly after arriving at FMC Devens the Defendant was advised of outstanding
warrants in the Lowell District Court. (Neither Defense counsel nor appointed state
counsel were aware of said warrants at the time of Defendants sentencing.) The
Defendant was further advised that the failure to clear these warrants would result in a
reclassification by the BOP and a transfer to a more secure facility. The Defendant is
receiving necessary medical treatment at FMC Devens.

        The undersigned counsel was able to remove the warrants and the matters were
set for trial in the Lowell District Court on February 12, 2008.
        The Defendant is requesting that this motion be allowed and the Bureau of
Prisons at FMC Devens be ordered to transport the Defendant to Lowell District Court on
February 12, 2008. A proposed order is attached hereto.
