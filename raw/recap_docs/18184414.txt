               ORDER AFFIRMING RECOMMENDED DECISION
                      OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE


      On August 22, 2016, the United States Magistrate Judge filed with the

court, with copies to the parties, his Recommended Decision on 28 U.S.C. § 2255

Motion.    The petitioner filed his objection to the Recommended Decision on

September 27, 2016.       I have reviewed and considered the Recommended

Decision, together with the entire record; I have made a de novo determination

of all matters adjudicated by the Recommended Decision; and I concur with the

recommendations of the United States Magistrate Judge for the reasons set forth

in the Recommended Decision, and determine that no further proceeding is

necessary.

      It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the Magistrate

Judge is hereby ADOPTED. An evidentiary hearing is not warranted under Rule

8 of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Cases. The petitioner’s motion for habeas

relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 is DENIED. No certificate of appealability shall issue

because there is no substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right

within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).

      SO ORDERED.

      DATED THIS 24TH DAY OF OCTOBER, 2016
