      v.                              Case No. 08-cr-56-01-SM

      Re: Document No. 77, Motion to Appoint New Counsel

     Ruling: Denied, without prejudice. Defendantâ€™s pro se motion
seeking appointment of substitute counsel does not assert facts
warranting that relief. Defendant is entitled to effective legal
representation, not an attorney who will follow all directions
given by him. Counsel is ethically and legally bound not to file
wasteful or frivolous motions, nor is counsel permitted, under
local rules, to file motions related to discovery production until
and unless informal requests for same are rejected by the
government. This case is also scheduled for trial during the next
trial period in August, and allowing substitute counsel at this
point would necessarily delay resolution of the charges even
further. While defendant makes vague reference to an irremediable
breakdown in the professional relationship between him an counsel,
nothing in the motion supports that claim.
