      DECISION AND ORDER ON MOTION FOR COMPASSIONATE RELEASE


        I sentenced Richard Sylvester on October 30, 2019, to two concurrent

prison terms—30 months in 2:17-CR-52-DBH-03 for conspiracy to traffic

narcotics (ECF No. 235), and 72 months in 1:17-CR-94-DBH for a later

possession with intent to distribute narcotics and possessing a firearm in

furtherance of a drug trafficking crime (ECF No. 135). Sylvester self-reported to

prison on January 15, 2020. (ECF Nos. 242, 243).

        Under a plea agreement, Sylvester waived his right to appeal the shorter

sentence (2:17-CR-52-03).      Pursuant to a conditional plea on the crime

underlying the longer sentence (1:17-CR-94), he appealed my ruling there that

denied his motion to suppress. That appeal is now pending before the First

Circuit. No. 19-2127 (1st Cir.) (case argued Feb. 1, 2021).

        Sylvester is currently imprisoned at USP Canaan with a projected release

date of September 26, 2024.      The current COVID-19 conditions there are 4

inmates and 8 staff positive with the virus, and 282 inmates and 52 staff who
Case 1:17-cr-00094-DBH Document 161 Filed 02/10/21 Page 2 of 5       PageID #: 948




have recovered.   See BOP, COVID-19 Cases, Federal Bureau of Prisons (last

updated Feb. 9, 2021), https://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/.

      Sylvester seeks compassionate release under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A).

The government concedes that he has waited the mandatory 30 days after

requesting relief from the Warden. Gov’t’s Resp. at 12 n.7 (ECF No. 153). But

the government argues that I have no jurisdiction in light of the pending appeal

(though it concedes I may issue an “indicative ruling” under Fed. R. Crim. P.

37(a)(3)). Id. at 12-15. Sylvester argues that I do have jurisdiction or at least

that I can issue an “indicative ruling.” Def.’s Reply at 2 (ECF No. 158). I decline

to issue an indicative ruling and instead DENY the motion under Rule 37(a)(2) for

the reasons that follow.

      With respect to the merits of a compassionate release motion, the Second,

Fourth, Sixth, and Seventh Circuits have ruled that Guideline policy statement

1B1.13, which preceded Congress’s First Step Act amendment of section 3582,

applies only to motions brought by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons (which

before the amendment had exclusive power to bring such motions).            Those

Circuits have ruled that by its clear language the policy statement does not apply

to defendants’ motions for relief, and that on defendant’s motions, nothing limits

judges’ discretion in considering “the full slate of extraordinary and compelling

reasons that an imprisoned person might bring before them in motions for

compassionate release.” United States v. Brooker, 976 F.3d 228, 235-37 (2d Cir.

2020); accord United States v. McCoy, 981 F.3d 271, 281-83 (4th Cir. 2020);

United States v. Jones, 980 F.3d 1098, 1108-11 (6th Cir. 2020); United States

v. Gunn, 980 F.3d 1178, 1180 (7th Cir. 2020). Only the Eleventh Circuit seems
                                                                                 2

to disagree. See United States v. Monaco, 832 F. App’x 626, 628-29 (11th Cir.

2020) (per curiam) (applying 1B1.13 without analyzing the issue).1 I proceed

therefore to assess whether Sylvester has presented “extraordinary and

compelling reasons” for me to order his early release.

       Sylvester does have medical conditions, two of which (Wolff-Parkinson-

White syndrome2 and sleep apnea) were known when I sentenced him. PSR

¶¶ 67-68. A third, pancreatitis, developed after sentencing but before he self-

reported to prison.        (ECF No. 242).         Although Sylvester is understandably

concerned about his medical conditions under the COVID-19 threat, none of his

conditions is listed by CDC as creating a greater risk of severe illness from

COVID-19.              People      with      Certain       Medical        Conditions,        CDC,

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-

with-medical-conditions.html (updated Feb. 3, 2021).                       Sylvester refers to

emerging research on such a relationship, Def.’s Mot. at 19-21, but the CDC has

not changed its guidelines. Even if the relationship is established and meets the

“extraordinary and compelling reasons” standard of 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A), I

decline to grant Sylvester compassionate release for the reasons that follow.

       Seriousness of medical conditions is not the end of the analysis in

determining whether a motion for compassionate release should be granted.


1 The Fifth Circuit applied the Guideline policy statement in United States v. Bell, 823 F. App’x
283, 284 (5th Cir. 2020) (per curiam), but later announced that it was “an open question”
whether the policy statement applies, United States v. Gowdy, 832 F. App’x 325, 327 & n.4 (5th
Cir. 2020). The First Circuit has not addressed the issue directly, but it did recognize the use of
other factors in United States v. Fox, No. 19-1785 (1st Cir. July 23, 2020) (“the district court did
consider other relevant circumstances not specifically enumerated in the guidelines”) aff’g No.
2:14-cr-03-DBH, 2019 WL 3046086 (D. Me. July 11, 2019).
2 Often called WPW, a congenital heart rhythm problem. Sylvester says he has had more frequent

bouts of arrhythmia in prison. Def.’s Mot. at 18.
                                                                                                  3
Case 1:17-cr-00094-DBH Document 161 Filed 02/10/21 Page 4 of 5        PageID #: 950




According to the statute, I must also consider “the factors set forth in section

3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable.” 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A). I find

the following factors from the statute to be most pertinent here: “the nature and

circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the

defendant,” “the need for the sentence imposed . . . to reflect the seriousness of

the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for

the offense; [and] . . . to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct.” 18

U.S.C. § 3553(a).

         Sylvester points out that at sentencing I complimented him for what he

had done to rehabilitate himself over the preceding couple of years, Def.’s Mot.

at 25, 27, and called him a “changed man,” id. at 27, and argues that he is no

longer a danger to the public. But I made those comments in the context of

imposing a 72-month sentence, a sentence that I concluded met the

section 3553(a) factors. At the traffic stop3 that resulted in his indictment in

1:17-CR-94, Sylvester possessed over 80 grams of packaged cocaine, 20 grams

of methamphetamine, 2 grams of heroin, drug ledgers and drug paraphernalia,

almost $3,000 in cash, a knife, brass knuckles, a loaded handgun, and a loaded

magazine. PSR ¶¶ 20-21. This was a dangerous crime that called for significant

punishment.

         As of now Sylvester has served about 30% of his full term. Gov’t’s Resp.

at 3. I congratulate Sylvester for his apparently continued self-improvement in

prison, but it would trivialize his crime to reduce his sentence now to time served.



3   Now the subject of the appeal.
                                                                                  4

      I DENY Sylvester’s motion for compassionate release under Fed. R. Crim.

P. 37(a)(2).

      SO ORDERED.
