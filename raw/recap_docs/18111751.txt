                    ORDER AFFIRMING THE
         RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE

      In this much-litigated criminal case, the Court affirms the Magistrate Judge’s

Recommended Decision on the Petitioner’s multiple motions. Although not all the

issues require explanation beyond what the Magistrate Judge has written, the Court

addressed three matters raised in his objections: (1) whether Mr. McCurdy’s motion

under Rule 60(b) is a successive § 2255 petition by another name; (2) whether that

motion, if it were treated as a Rule 60(b) motion, would be timely; and (3) whether

the self-styled § 2255 motion is successive. The Court has concluded that none of Mr.

McCurdy’s objections requires a result different from what the Magistrate Judge

recommended.

I.    THE PARTIES’ FILINGS AND THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE’S
      RECOMMENDED DECISION

      The Court has before it a raft of motions. Given the extensive procedural

history of this matter, the Court documents only those motions relevant to the present

Order.

      On October 1, 2014, Mr. McCurdy moved pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil

Procedure 60(b) for relief from the Court’s September 27, 2013 order denying his first

28 U.S.C. § 2255 motion. Mot. for Relief from J. (Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)) (ECF No. 315)

(Rule 60(b) Mot.). On January 14, 2015, the Government responded to Mr. McCurdy’s

Rule 60(b) motion. Gov’t’s Opp’n to “Mot. for Relief from J. (Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b))” (ECF

No. 325). On March 16, 2015, Mr. McCurdy replied to the Government’s opposition

to his Rule 60(b) motion. Pet’r’s Partial Reply to Gov’t’s Opp’n to Mot. for Relief from

J. (Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)) (ECF No. 334).

      Also on March 16, 2015, Mr. McCurdy filed eight other motions: (1) Mot. for

Appointment of Counsel (R. Governing §2255 Proc. 6(a) (ECF No. 335); (2) Mot. for

Leave to Conduct Disc. (ECF No. 336); (3) Mot. for Produc. of Docs., Reqs. for Admis.

the Government responded to this motion, Gov’t’s Opp’n to “Pet’r’s Mot. for Proposed

Findings of Fact (Fed.R.Civ.P. 52)” (ECF No. 349), and on May 26, 2015, Mr. McCurdy

replied to the Government’s opposition. Pet’r’s Reply to Gov’t’s Opp’n to Proposed

Findings of Fact (ECF No. 350).

      On July 6, 2015, Mr. McCurdy moved to vacate, set aside, or correct his

sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Mot. to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct a

Sentence by a Person in Federal Custody (28 USC § 2255) (ECF No. 351).

      The Magistrate Judge filed with the Court his Recommended Decision on all

of the above motions on July 28, 2015. Recommended Decision on 28 U.S.C. § 2255

Mot., Mot. for Relief from J., Mot. for Findings of Fact, Mot. for Counsel and Disc.

(ECF No. 356) (§ 2255 Obj.). On January 8, 2016, Mr. McCurdy moved to expedite

proceedings. Pet’r’s Mot. to Expedite Proceedings (28 USC §1657(a)) (ECF No. 365).

II.   DISCUSSION

      Although the Court concurs with the Magistrate Judge for the reasons stated

in the Recommended Decision, it addresses in further detail three issues that Mr.

McCurdy has pressed in his objections to the Recommended Decision: (1) whether Mr.

McCurdy’s motion under Rule 60(b) is a successive § 2255 petition by another name;

(2) whether that motion, if it were treated as a Rule 60(b) motion, would be timely;

and (3) whether the self-styled § 2255 motion is successive. In the Court’s view, the

remaining issues do not warrant separate discussion.

      A.     60(b) Motion

      In his objection to the Magistrate Judge’s recommendation on the Rule 60(b)

motion, Mr. McCurdy writes that his “claims are true 60(b) claims because they

neither challenge the merits of the Court’s §2255 decision nor the criminal conviction;

instead, they challenge the integrity of the §2255 proceeding as procedurally flawed.”

Rule 60(b) Obj. at 5. He identifies three perceived procedural defects—“the Court’s

failure to allow discovery, appoint counsel or conduct an evidentiary hearing”—

which, taken together, he believes constitute a Due Process violation. Id. at 4.

      The Court is unpersuaded. In Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005), the

Supreme Court answered the question of “whether a Rule 60(b) motion filed by a

habeas petitioner is a ‘habeas corpus application’ as the statute uses that term.” Id.

at 530. While a Rule 60(b) motion that “attacks the federal court’s previous resolution



                                          4
Case 1:06-cr-00080-JAW Document 366 Filed 03/24/16 Page 5 of 9           PageID #: 3481



on the merits . . . is effectively indistinguishable from alleging that the movant is,

under the substantive provisions of the statutes, entitled to habeas relief,” a Rule

60(b) motion that “attacks, not the substance of the federal court’s resolution of a

claim on the merits, but some defect in the integrity of the federal habeas

proceedings” can be properly treated as a Rule 60(b) motion. Id. at 532 (emphasis in

original) (footnotes omitted). The distinction is essentially between substance and

procedure. While Mr. McCurdy is at pains to cast his Rule 60(b) motion as procedural,

Rule 60(b) Obj. at 2-5, the Court agrees with the Magistrate Judge that “the motion

for relief from judgment is focused on the substance of [Mr. McCurdy’s] claims of

ineffective assistance of counsel.” Rec. Dec. at 11. The Court rejects Mr. McCurdy’s

attempt to characterize his challenge of the Court’s earlier ineffectiveness ruling—a

merits ruling—as one that merely identifies supposed procedural shortcomings (i.e.,

for lacking discovery, appointment of counsel, and an evidentiary hearing). The

Court decides that the Rule 60(b) motion is effectively a § 2255 petition.

      Mr. McCurdy does have a point regarding timeliness. The Magistrate Judge

wrote that even if he were to treat the motion under Rule 60(b), the motion would be

untimely because it contests an order that came down on September 27, 2013, was

filed on October 1, 2014, and the rule is that such motions must be filed no more than

a year after the entry of the judgment. Id. at 12 n.10 (citing FED. R. CIV. P. 60(c)(1))

Mr. McCurdy’s objection points out that the “prison mailbox rule” would date the

document to September 26, 2014 rather than October 1, 2014—thus making the filing

timely. Rule 60(b) Obj. at 6. Indeed, although the Court received and filed the motion



                                           5
Case 1:06-cr-00080-JAW Document 366 Filed 03/24/16 Page 6 of 9                       PageID #: 3482



on October 1, 2014, Mr. McCurdy dated the motion to September 26, 2014.1 Rule

60(b) Mot. at 35 (Certificate of Service).

       The law supports Mr. McCurdy’s position that the motion should be dated from

the time of sending rather than receipt. See Casanova v. Dubois, 304 F.3d 75, 79 (1st

Cir. 2002) (“In light of the fact that the prisoners can do no more than hand over their

complaint to the prison officials, and do not have any discretion over how the

complaint will be filed, the relevant point should be when the complaint is handed

over to the prison officials”). Accordingly, if Mr. McCurdy’s motion were a true Rule

60(b) motion, it would be timely. Because the Court has decided that the motion

comes under § 2255, however, the result remains the same: the Court dismisses Mr.

McCurdy’s motion without prejudice.

       B.      § 2255 Motion

       In his objection to the Magistrate Judge’s recommendation on the § 2255

motion, Mr. McCurdy writes that the motion “is not a successive §2255 motion

because it does not challenge the criminal judgment nor does it ‘attack’ the merits of

the conviction or sentence, instead he seeks only to have his direct appeal rights

reinstated without the added burden of the Government’s judicial deception.” § 2255

Obj. at 2. The deception, according to Mr. McCurdy, came in the form of two “highly

prejudicial misstatements of fact, that (1) [he] waived his rights and that (2) he

possessed 30 rounds of 40mm ammunition.” Id. Regarding when he discovered these



1      Although the envelope attached to the motion does not confirm the date Mr. McCurdy placed
the motion in the prison mail, the Court accepts Mr. McCurdy’s representation that he mailed the
motion on September 26, 2014. See Rule 60(b) Obj. at 6; Rule 60(b) Mot. at 35 (Certificate of Service).

                                                  6
Case 1:06-cr-00080-JAW Document 366 Filed 03/24/16 Page 7 of 9             PageID #: 3483



putative misstatements, Mr. McCurdy maintains that although he believed they were

false during the preparation of his earlier § 2255 motion, “the factual basis for this

claim did not ripen until he received the requested information from the Machias

Police Dept., which was long after the proceeding on his initial §2255 concluded.” Id.

at 7.

        As the Court sees it, Mr. McCurdy is mistaken. The Magistrate Judge notes

that “a numerically second petition is not ‘second or successive’ if it attacks a different

criminal judgment or if the earlier petition terminated without a judgment on the

merits.’” Rec. Dec. at 10 (quoting United States v. Barrett, 178 F.3d 34, 43 (1st Cir.

1999)). Here, because Mr. McCurdy challenges the same criminal judgment, J. (ECF

No. 195), and because that earlier petition arrived at a judgment on the merits, Order

on Def.’s First and Second Mots. for Leave to File Suppl. Pleadings and on Def.’s Mot.

under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 to Vacate, Set Aside or Correct Sentence (ECF No. 305), the

motion is successive.

        Recent guidance from the First Circuit underscores this conclusion. See Bucci

v. United States, 809 F.3d 23, 27 (1st Cir. 2015) (rejecting the argument that it

“should forgo a literal reading of ‘second or successive’ whenever a petitioner arguably

raises a claim that could not have been raised in a prior habeas petition”).

Accordingly, until Mr. McCurdy satisfies the gatekeeping requirements of §§ 2255(h)

and 2244(b)(3)(A), the Court is without jurisdiction to consider his successive § 2255

motion. See Trenkler v. United States, 536 F.3d 85, 96 (1st Cir. 2008) (“AEDPA

required a federal prisoner who sought to prosecute a second or successive section



                                            7
Case 1:06-cr-00080-JAW Document 366 Filed 03/24/16 Page 8 of 9         PageID #: 3484



2255 petition to obtain pre-clearance, in the form of a certificate, from the court of

appeals. . . . We have interpreted this provision as ‘stripping the district court of

jurisdiction over a second or successive habeas petition unless and until the court of

appeals has decreed that it may go forward’”) (citations omitted). As with the motion

filed under Rule 60(b), the Court dismisses the self-styled § 2255 motion without

prejudice so that Mr. McCurdy may seek the First Circuit’s permission to file

successively if he so chooses.

III.   THE COURT’S ORDER

       The Court has reviewed and considered the Magistrate Judge’s Recommended

Decision, together with the entire record; the Court has made a de novo
