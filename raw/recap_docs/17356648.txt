   ORDER ON DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO REMOVE CIMS CLASSIFICATION

         Before the Court is Defendant Ranni’s pro se Motion to Remove CIMS

  Classification (Docket # 81).      As explained herein, the Court DENIES the motion

  WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

         In October 2003, Ranni and co-defendant Thomas Shafer pleaded guilty to

  various counts of an Information (Docket # 31) charging them for their involvement in

  three bank robberies. This Court proceeded to impose judgment and sentence, which

  included a three-year term of supervised release for each Defendant. (See Judgments

  (Docket #s 46 & 47) at 3.) In addition to the standard conditions of supervised release,

  the Court imposed a special condition preventing Defendants from having

  “communication or contact” with each other. (See id. at 4.) In July 2008, Defendants

  moved to modify this condition so that they could “marry . . . upon their release from

  prison.” (See Def.’s Mot. for Modification (Docket # 68) at 2.) In September 2008, the

  Court denied Defendants’ request without prejudice. (See Order (Docket # 72).)

         Defendant Ranni now moves to remove the separation (CIMS) classification

  resulting from the special condition of supervised release; in other words, this Motion

  appears simply to renew Defendants’ earlier request for modification. In short, the Court
Case 2:03-cr-00090-GZS Document 83 Filed 06/22/09 Page 2 of 2                   PageID #: 268



  continues to believe that the special condition “serves the twin purposes of protecting the

  public from future crime and encouraging Defendants’ rehabilitation, and is []

  ‘reasonably related to’ permissible purposes of supervised release.” (Id. at 2.) See 18

  U.S.C. § 3583(d)(1); USSG § 5D1.3(b).            To the extent Defendant Ranni’s Motion

  requests an order compelling the Government “to contact appropriate regional office

  authorities for both parties and remove the [classification]” or to provide any other type

  of administrative remedy, the Court cannot grant the requested relief.

         Accordingly, the Court DENIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE Defendant Ranni’s pro

  se Motion to Remove CIMS Classification (Docket # 81). As previously indicated, once

  Defendants commence their terms of supervised release, the Court is willing to consider a

  renewed motion for modification or removal of the special condition, depending on the

  status of each Defendant’s rehabilitation.

         SO ORDERED.

                                                        United States District Judge

  Dated this 22nd day of June, 2009.
