                             UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                           FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND

UNITES STATES OF AMERICA

vs.                                                     CR No. 99-091-ML

JOSE ANTONIO DIAZ

                                  MEMORANDUM AND ORDER

        Before this Court is Jose Antonio Diaz's motion to reduce sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C.

§3582(c)(2) (Doc. #61). For the reasons that follow, that motion is denied.

                           FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND TRAVEL

        In January 2000 Diaz pled guilty to robbery and firearms charges, including conspiracy to

rob a federally-insured financial institution, in violationof18 U.S.C. §371 (Count I); armed robbery

ofafederally-insured bank, in violation of18 U.S.C. §§ 2113 (a) and (d)(CountII); using a firearm

in the commission of a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §924(c) (Count IV); and

possessing a firearm after having been convicted of a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §922(g)(l)

(Count V). 1 According to the prosecution's version of events, Diaz and an accomplice committed

an armed robbery of a Fleet Bank in East Providence, Rhode Island on August 6, 1999. The

accomplice was armed with a pistol grip shotgun and Diaz was armed with what appeared to be a

handgun that he had stolen in an earlier robbery. Diaz and his accomplice absconded with

$32,805.50 from the bank and a gold necklace from a customer. 2 The two robbers were also

implicated in three other convenience store or fast-food restaurant robberies. (See Transcript of

Change of Plea Hearing conducted on January 18,2000 ["Plea Tr."] at 16-18.)



        1   Count III was dismissed at the request of the Government.

        2  The accomplice, Ruben Ramirez, pled guilty to similar charges, and was sentenced, in a
separate proceeding.
        The presentence report (PSR) calculated offense levels of23 for the robbery offenses (Counts

I and II) and 26 for the firearm possession offense (Count V) (PSR, ~~ 14-28), but also found that

Diaz was an armed career criminal and calculated an offense level of 34 in connection with the

§924(c) offense (Count IV) (Id., ~~ 29-30.)3 At sentencing Diaz denied that the weapon he used

during the robbery was a firearm and claimed that it was actually an air-powered BB gun. After an

evidentiary hearing, the Court (Lagueux, J.) found that the gun was in fact a fully functioning firearm

that Diaz had stolen in an earlier robbery of a convenience store (See Transcript of Sentencing

Hearing conducted on April27, 2000 ["Sent Tr."] at 80-82.) The Court established Diaz's offense

level at 34, based on his status as an armed career criminal, and sentenced him to 60 months

imprisonment on Count I and 262 months imprisonment on Counts II and V, all to be served

concurrently, and to 84 months imprisonment on Count IV, to be served consecutively to the

sentences on Counts I, II and V. (Id. at 83,91-92.)

        Diaz's conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal, United States v. Diaz, Dkt. No. 00-

1783,27 Fed.Appx. 2 (Ist Cir. Nov. 16,2001), and his various requests for postconviction relief

filed in this Court have been denied. 4

        Diazthen filed the instant motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582 (c)(2),

relying on Amendment 599 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines. The Government opposes

the motion. (See Government's Response [Doc. #64].)




         3   As noted by the sentencing court, the PSR inadvertently reversed the references to Counts IV
and V in its discussion of offense levels. (See PSR at 10.) This Court refers to the respective counts as
set forth in the Indictment (Doc. #1) and Judgment (Doc. #33).

        4  See ~ Order (Doc. #60) entered on July 16,2008 denying Motion for Correction of
Sentence pursuant to USSG Amendment 709. See also Order denying Motion to Vacate (Doc. #8) in
Diaz v. United States, CA 09-507-L (D.R.I. Feb. 13, 2003).
                                                  -2-
                                              DISCUSSION

        In his motion, Diaz asserts that his sentence was improperly enhanced twice for the use of

the firearm: first in connection with his sentencing on Count II, the robbery offense, and then as to

Count IV, the subject of a separate offense and separate sentence. Seeking to 'correct' this, Diaz

invokes Guideline Amendment 599, which took effect on November 1,2000,5 six months after he

was sentenced. Diaz contends that based on Amendment 599, his sentence on Count IV should be

reduced. (Motion to Reduce at 2-4; Reply at 1-3.)

   As a threshold matter, the Government points out that Diaz faces procedural hurdles in asserting

the instant motion -- contending (1) that Diaz is precluded from raising his claim some ten years after

the basis for it (i.e., the promulgation ofAmendment 599) first appeared, where he failed to raise it

on direct appeal or in his earlier postconviction filings; and (2) that the proper vehicle for asserting

such a claim is a motion to vacate or set aside or correct his sentence under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, rather

than § 3582(c). (Gov't Response at 2-3.) However, this Court need not address these procedural

issues, because it is clear in any event that Diaz's claim fails on the merits.

       Diaz's claim is foreclosed by established case law in this circuit. See United States v. Hickey,

280 F.3d 65 (1st Cir. 2002). In Hickey, the defendant, relying on Amendment 599, filed a motion

under §3582(c)(2) to reduce his sentence imposed eleven years earlier for armed robbery, in violation

of 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 2113(d), and use ofa firearm during the commission of an armed robbery, in



       5   Amendment 599 amends Commentary 2 to USSG §2K2.4 to provide in pertinent part:
           If a sentence under this guideline is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an
           underlying offense, do not apply any specific offense characteristic for possession,
           brandishing, use, or discharge of an explosive or firearm when determining the
           sentence for the underlying offense.
USSG Guidelines Manual, Supp. to App. C, Amendment 599, 2d para. See also id., Amend. 607 (making
Amendment 599 retroactive).
                                                     -3-
violation of § 924(c). The district court granted the motion and re-sentenced Hickey to a lesser

sentence. Id. at 65. The Court of Appeals noted that Hickey had been sentenced under the armed

career criminal guideline, US SG §4B1.1 , rather than under the guidelines for his underlying offenses

and that therefore Amendment 599 did not apply. Hickey, 280 F.3d at 69. The court held that the

district court was withoutjurisdiction to modify Hickey's sentence and vacated the reduced sentence.

Id. at 66, 69. Hickey thus "stands for the proposition that a sentencing court has no authority to

entertain a sentence reduction motion under section 3582(c)(2) when the guideline amendment in

question does not affectthe guideline sentencing range actually used by the sentencing court." United

States v. Caraballo, 552 F.3d 6, 11 (1st Cir. 2008) (citing Hickey, 280 F.3d at 69).

       Here, Diaz was similarly convicted of both armed robbery (Count II) and two firearms

offenses -- using a firearm in the commission of a felony (the §924(c) offense, Count IV) and being

a felon in possession of a firearm (the §922(g) offense, Count V). His sentence was similarly based

on the offense level found under the armed career criminal guideline, USSG § 4B1.1, rather than on

the lower offense levels for his underlying offenses. (PSR,   ~~   30,66). See Caraballo, 552 F.3d at

9-10 (noting that where career offender guideline offense level is greater than that for underlying

offense(s), sentencing court must use career offender guideline).

       Moreover, the guideline enhancements calculated in connection with Diaz's underlying

offenses (although not ultimately used) did not include any enhancement for "possession,

brandishing, use, or discharge of a ... firearm," under USSG §2K2.4, which was the subject of

Amendment 599. Rather, the only enhancements used in connection with his robbery offense were

based on the facts that the subject of the robbery was a federal financial institution and the amount

of loss was more than $10,000. (pSR,       ~~   14-16.) Thus, there was no "double counting" in


                                                 -4-
connection with Diaz's use of a firearm and no error in sentencing.

           In short, Amendment 599 did not affect the guideline sentencing range used by the sentencing

court in imposing Diaz's sentence, and therefore this Court has no authority to entertain the instant

motion under §3582(c)(2). See Hickey, 280 F.3d at 69.


           This Court has considered all ofDiaz's other arguments and finds them to be without

merit. 6

                                             CONCLUSION

           For all of the foregoing reasons, Diaz's motion to reduce sentence is hereby DENIED and

DISMISSED.




         6   Diaz filed a Notice of Supplemental Authority (Doc. #66), invoking United States v. O'Brien,
130 S.Ct. 2169 (2010). That decision, however, is inapposite to the instant case, as it simply holds that
the type offirearm involved, a machine gun, was an element ofa use-of-firearm offense under 18 U.S.C.
§924(c)(1 )(B) to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt rather than a sentencing factor for that offense.
Id. at 2180.
         Other cases cited by Diaz in his papers are either distinguishable or do not support his position.
His reliance on Simpson v. United States, 435 U.S. 6 (1978) (Motion to Reduce at 2, Notice of
Addendum at 3), overlooks the fact that that decision was abrogated by the amendments to §924(c)
pursuant to the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, P.L. 98-473, §1005(a). See M. United States
v. Gonzales, 520 US 1, 10 (1997) (noting abrogation). The decision in United States v. Dillon, 572 F3d
146 (3d Cir. 2009), affd, Dillon v. United States, 130 S.Ct. 2683 (2010), simply held that where a
Guideline Amendment is made retroactive, any sentence reduction must be within the lower guideline
range resulting from the amendment and is likewise inapposite.
         United States v. Cruz-Rodriguez, 541 F.3d 19 (1st Cir. 2008), is factually distinguishable. See id.
at 33-34 (no double counting where defendant's drug offense sentence was enhanced by his use of a
firearm, but accompanying offense was possession of a firearm near a school zone in violation of §924(a)
rather than a use-of-firearm offense under §924(c». Finally, United States v. Williams, 558 F3d 166 (2d
Cir. 2009), not only conflicts with First Circuit law, see United States v. Pulido, 566 F3d 52 (1st Cir.
2009), but was abrogated by Abbott v. United States, 131 S.Ct. 18, (2010) (holding that defendant was
subject to consecutive sentence for possessing firearm in furtherance of felony drug offense under
§924(c), despite higher minimum sentences for his separate convictions for related offenses).

                      RULING ON CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY

       Pursuant to Rule l1(a) of the Rules Governing § 2255 Proceedings in the United States

District Courts ("§ 2255 Rules"), this Court hereby finds that this case is not appropriate for the

issuance of a certificate of appealability (COA), because Diaz has failed to make a substantial

showing ofthe denial ofa constitutional right as to any claim, as required by 28 U.S.C. §2253(c)(2).

       Diaz is advised that any motion to reconsider this ruling will not extend the time to file a

notice of appeal in this matter. See § 2255 Rule 11(a).
