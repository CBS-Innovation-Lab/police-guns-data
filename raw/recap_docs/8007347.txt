                        IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                          FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO


 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
 Plaintiff
 vs                                                 CRIMINAL 98-0152CCC
 1) RICARDO SEGARRA-ORTIZ
 a/k/a Chino
 2) JULIO A. GONZALEZ-IRIZARRY,
 a/k/a Chino
 3) WILLIAM DETRES-MARQUEZ and
 4) ALEX X. COLMENARES-ORTIZ
 Defendants
                                          ORDER
        The letter-motions filed by defendant Julio González pro se on August 16, 2005
(docket entry 221) and September 7, 2005 (docket entry 222), considered as a request
for clarification of the condition of restitution imposed as part of defendant’s sentence, are
DENIED. The Judgment entered on November 15, 2001 (docket entry 178) specifically
provides at page 4 that “defendant shall make restitution in the amount of $25,905.00 to
Citibank . . . to be paid in 60 installments during his supervision period.” (Emphasis ours.) It
is patently clear, then, that payment of the restitution amount would begin during defendant’s
terms of supervised release. In addition, 18 U.S.C. § 3612(f)(1) provides that “. . . defendant
shall pay interest on any fine or restitution of more than $2,500, unless the fine is paid in full
before the fifteenth day after the date of the judgment.”
        SO ORDERED.
        At San Juan, Puerto Rico, on October 11, 2005.
