                  ORDER ON PETITIONER’S OBJECTIONS


      After I entered my Order on March 4, 2015, affirming the Recommended

Decision of the Magistrate Judge because the time to object had expired on

February 23, 2015, the defendant/petitioner filed on March 9, 2015, his

“Objections.” He has not provided any reason for his late response. (Without

explanation he attaches a handwritten envelope marked “return to sender”

addressed to him at the Penobscot County Jail, ostensibly from the Clerk’s Office

of the federal court in Bangor, but the Clerk’s Office uses pre-printed envelopes

and typed labels, and Penobscot County Jail is not the current address that the

Clerk’s Office uses for him.) I have read the “Objections” and see no reason to

vacate my Order of March 4, 2015. Therefore, the objections are OVERRULED.

      SO ORDERED.

      DATED THIS 10TH DAY OF MARCH, 2014
