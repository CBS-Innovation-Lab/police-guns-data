                       DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

            v.                               Case No. 10-cr-88-03SM

Brittney Indoccio



                                    ORDER

      The defendant Brittney Indoccio, through counsel, has moved to continue the

trial scheduled for October 19, 2010 for a period of 90 days, citing the need for

additional time to engage in negotiations with the government, and time to enable the

defendant to complete a 90-day drug treatment program. Counsel for the co-

defendants and the government do not object to a continuance of the trial date.

      Accordingly, for the above reasons, the court will continue the trial from

October 19, 2010 to January 19, 2011. In agreeing to continue the trial, the court

finds pursuant to 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(7)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the best interests of the

speedy trial not later than October 18, 2010.
