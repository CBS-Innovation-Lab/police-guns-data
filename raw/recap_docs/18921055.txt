                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 09-cr-67-PB

Leonard Corson


                                  O R D E R

     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

trial scheduled for November 3, 2009 to allow additional time to

finalize a plea agreement or prepare for trial.            The government

does not object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reason and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from November 3, 2009 to December 1, 2009.            In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.

     The court will hold a final pretrial conference on November

23, 2009 at 2:00 p.m.
