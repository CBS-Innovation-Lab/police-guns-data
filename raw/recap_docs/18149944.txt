                                OPINION AND ORDER

WILLIAM E. SMITH, Chief Judge.

        Before   the    Court    is    Defendant       John    Collins’s     motion    to

vacate,    set   aside,    or     correct       his    sentence,     pursuant     to   28

U.S.C. § 2255. (See Def.’s Mot. to Vacate Sentence under § 2255

(Armed Career Criminal Act) (“Def.’s Mot. to Vacate”), ECF No.

29.)     His motion was filed in the wake of the Supreme Court’s

decision in Johnson v. United States (Johnson II), 135 S. Ct.

2551, 2557 (2015), which invalidated the residual clause of the

Armed     Career       Criminal        Act     (“ACCA”),       see      18   U.S.C.     §

924(e)(2)(B)(ii), for being unconstitutionally vague.                          Defendant

argues that, after Johnson II, he no longer has three qualifying

predicate    convictions        under        ACCA,    and   thus   he   is   serving    a

sentence    longer     than     that    allowed       by    law.     (Def.’s    Mot.   to

Vacate 1-2.)       The Government opposes Defendant’s motion, arguing

that his three prior convictions remain ACCA-qualifiers under

the force clause, which defines a violent felony as one that
  Case 1:03-cr-00051-S Document 33 Filed 11/02/16 Page 2 of 10 PageID #: 82



“has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of

physical force against the person of another.”                    18 U.S.C. §

924(e)(2)(B)(i).

     For the reasons stated below, the Court holds that assault

by an inmate, in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-25-2, is not a

violent   felony     under   ACCA’s      force   clause.    The    Court   will

schedule a hearing on Defendant’s motion and re-sentencing.

     I.     Background

     On August 11, 2003, Collins pleaded guilty to being a felon

in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)

(Count I), and possession of an unregistered sawed-off shot gun,

in violation of 26 U.S.C. §§ 5841, 5861(d), and 5871 (Count II).

Probation prepared a presentence investigation report (“PSR”),

which concluded that Collins was an armed career criminal under

ACCA with three prior convictions for ACCA-qualifying predicate

offenses.     (See    PSR    ¶   22.)     Specifically,    Collins   had   been

convicted of (1) second degree murder, in violation of R.I. Gen.

Laws § 11-23-1; (2) assault by an inmate, in violation of R.I.

Gen. Laws § 11-25-2; and (3) assault on a correctional officer,

in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-5-8.            (See id.)

     On October 31, 2003, this Court sentenced Collins to 210

months of incarceration on Count I and 120 months on Count II,

to be served concurrently.              (Judgment 1-2, ECF No. 25.)        ACCA

provides for a sentence of at least 180 months but not more than

                                          2
  Case 1:03-cr-00051-S Document 33 Filed 11/02/16 Page 3 of 10 PageID #: 83



life imprisonment for possessing a firearm or ammunition when a

person      has    three    prior     convictions        by    any   court    for    violent

felonies or serious drug offenses or a combination of both.                              See

18 U.S.C. § 924(e).               In the absence of an ACCA designation, a

conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm carries

with   it     a    maximum       sentence    of    120    months.         See   18   U.S.C.

§ 924(a)(2).         Collins has been incarcerated since at least June

2003 (or, more than 13 years).                     (Def.’s Mot. to Vacate 2, ECF

No. 29.)      Therefore, if one of Defendant’s predicate offenses no

longer qualifies as a violent felony under ACCA, Defendant has

served a longer sentence than the statutory maximum sentence

allowed by law and must be released.

       II.    Analysis

              A. The Offense: Assault by an Inmate, R.I. Gen. Laws
                 § 11-25-2

       To    determine       whether    an    offense         qualifies    as   a    violent

felony, the Court may “look only to the fact of conviction and

the statutory definition of the prior offense,” which is termed

the “categorical approach.”                  Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S.

575,    602       (1990).        To   satisfy      the    force      clause     under    the

categorical approach, the use, attempted use, or threatened use

of violent force must be an element of the prior offense.                                See

Descamps v. United States, 133 S. Ct. 2276, 2293 (2013).                                If a

conviction         for     the    offense     is    possible         without    proof     of


                                              3
    Case 1:03-cr-00051-S Document 33 Filed 11/02/16 Page 4 of 10 PageID #: 84



attempted, threatened, or actual use of violent force, then the

conviction does not qualify as a violent felony, even if the

defendant in fact used, attempted to use, or threatened to use

violent force in the commission of the crime.                          See id.      Put

differently, the Court looks not to the facts underlying the

actual conduct for which a defendant was convicted, but rather

the elements of that offense.                 Mathis v. United States, 136 S.

Ct. 2243, 2252 (2016).

       The     Court    must    first   determine       the    offense     for    which

Defendant was convicted. See id. at 2256 (“The first task for a

sentencing court faced with an alternatively phrased statute is

thus    to    determine     whether     its    listed   items    are     elements   or

means.”).       When it is not clear on the face of the statute, as

here,       whether    a   statute    is   divisible      (meaning      the   statute

describes two or more distinct offenses as opposed to various

means by which a single offense can be committed), a court must

employ the “modified categorical approach,” see Descamps, 133 S.

Ct. at 2281, which is described below.

       At    the    time   of    Defendant’s     conviction,        R.I.   Gen.   Laws

§   11-25-2,       entitled     “Assault   or    escape   by    a   custodial     unit

inmate,” stated:

       Every prisoner confined in any custodial unit of the
       adult correctional institutions or in the custody of
       the warden or other correctional employee while
       outside the confines of the institutions or in the
       custody of the director of mental health, retardation

                                           4
  Case 1:03-cr-00051-S Document 33 Filed 11/02/16 Page 5 of 10 PageID #: 85



      and hospitals pursuant to the provisions of § 40.1-
      5.3-1 of the general laws, who shall assault the
      warden,   or  other   correctional  employee   of said
      institution, or shall escape, or attempt to effect an
      escape, shall be sentenced by the court to a term of
      imprisonment in the adult correctional institutions
      for not less than one year nor more than twenty (20)
      years,   except  where    the  original  sentence  was
      imprisonment for life, said term to commence from the
      expiration of the original term of such prisoner.

R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-25-2 (1984) (emphasis added).                 Deferring to

the   state-law   construction    of   the   offense,   it   is    plain    that

§ 11-25-2 is divisible into the distinct offenses of “assault by

an inmate” and “escape by an inmate.”          See   State v. Robalewski,

418 A.2d 817, 819, 826 (R.I. 1980), abrogated on other grounds

by Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128, 151-52 (1990) (affirming

convictions for assault by an inmate and escape by an inmate in

separate counts; rejecting the argument that an assault under

§ 11-25-2 merges into an escape under the same statute; and

stating that the defendant did not dispute that “assault and

escape are distinct offenses”); see also State v. Tregaskis, 540

A.2d 1022, 1023 (R.I. 1988) (analyzing a conviction for escape

as a custodial-unit inmate pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-25-2

and excluding the language about assault by an inmate).

      Under the modified categorical approach, the Court looks to

a limited class of documents — so-called Shepard-documents — for

the sole purpose of determining a defendant’s relevant offense

under a divisible statute.       Descamps, 133 S. Ct. at 2281.             Here,



                                       5
  Case 1:03-cr-00051-S Document 33 Filed 11/02/16 Page 6 of 10 PageID #: 86



the government has produced Defendant’s judgment of conviction

and the charging documents, which indicate that Defendant was

convicted    of   “Assault       by   a    maximum      custodial      inmate.”       (See

United States’ Resp. to Pet. under § 2255 Johnson Claim in ACCA

Case (“Gov’t Resp.”) 15, ECF No. 31.)                   The Court thus concludes

that Defendant was convicted of assault, rather than escape, by

a custodial inmate, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-25-2.

            B. Whether Assault by an Inmate is a Violent Felony
               under ACCA

      At the time of Defendant’s conviction, § 11-25-2 stated in

relevant part:           “Every prisoner . . . who shall assault the

warden, or other correctional employee of the institution . . .

shall be sentenced [to a maximum of 20 years in prison].”                            Thus,

to be convicted of assault by an inmate, the state must prove

that (1) a custodial inmate, as defined by the statute, (2)

completed    a    simple     assault       (3)       upon   the     warden    or     other

correctional employee.

      The   Rhode       Island   Supreme       Court    has   held    that     the   word

“assault”    in     §     11-25-2     “has      an     established     and     ordinary

definition in the criminal law” and that “[n]othing in § 11-25-2

warrants a departure from that definition, imports ambiguity to

the   established        meaning,     or     suggests        that    the     Legislature

intended that word to receive other than the single and definite

meaning it has in the criminal law.”                        State v. Camerlin, 360


                                           6
  Case 1:03-cr-00051-S Document 33 Filed 11/02/16 Page 7 of 10 PageID #: 87



A.2d    862,    867     (R.I.    1976);    see    also   Gov’t     Resp.    3    (“The

government assumes arguendo that as used in section 11-25-2, the

word ‘assault’ has the same meaning as the common law definition

of simple assault.”).            At common law, simple assault is defined

as an “unlawful attempt or offer, with force or violence, to do

a corporal hurt to another, whether from malice or wantonness.”

State v. Lomba, 37 A.3d 615, 620 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v.

Pope, 414 A.2d 781, 788 (R.I. 1980)); see also Camerlin, 360

A.2d at 866 (recognizing that jury was properly instructed with

the “established and ordinary definition” of “assault” as “any

unlawful    attempt      or     offer    with    force   or   violence     to    do    a

corporal hurt to another”).              In Rhode Island, simple assault is

a general-intent crime punished as a misdemeanor. R.I. Gen. Laws

§ 11-5-3 (“[E]very person who shall make an assault or battery

or both shall be imprisoned not exceeding one year . . . .”);

see State v. Kausel, 68 A.3d 524, 531 (R.I. 2013) (describing

simple assault as a “general intent crime”) (citing Lomba, 37

A.3d at 620).

       This Court recently held that Rhode Island assault with a

dangerous      weapon    (ADW)    does    not    constitute    a   violent      felony

under   ACCA’s    force       clause.      See    generally    United      States     v.

Sabetta, 00-cr-135-S-PAS, 2016 WL 6157454, at *12 (D.R.I. Oct.

24, 2016).      More specifically, the Court held that Rhode Island

ADW does not require more than a recklessness mens rea.                             Id.

                                           7
  Case 1:03-cr-00051-S Document 33 Filed 11/02/16 Page 8 of 10 PageID #: 88



The reasoning with respect to the mens rea sufficient to satisfy

a conviction for ADW applies with the same force to the mens rea

required     to    satisfy     a   conviction      for       assault       by    an    inmate.

Nothing on the face of the statute or in the case law suggests

that the additional elements (namely, that an inmate commit the

offense on a correctional officer) alters the mens rea analysis.

As such, the Court holds that recklessness is a sufficient mens

rea   to   satisfy       a   conviction     for    assault       by    an       inmate,      and

therefore, does not qualify as a predicate offense under ACCA’s

force clause.           See United States v. Fish, 758 F.3d 1, 16 (1st

Cir. 2014) (holding that a crime that only requires proving a

recklessness mens rea, i.e., “conduct bereft of an intent to

employ     force    against    another[,]       falls        short    of    the       mens   rea

required        under    section    16(b));       see    also        Sabetta,         2016   WL

6157454,     at    *7-9      (concluding    that        an    offense       that       can   be

committed recklessly does not qualify as a violent felony under

ACCA’s force clause).

      Because the Court concludes that assault by a custodial

unit inmate, in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-25-2, no longer

constitutes a violent felony under ACCA, it need not reach the

merits     of     Defendant’s      motion   with        respect       to    second-degree

murder or assault on a correctional officer. 1


      1
      Since the residual clause was deemed unconstitutional by
the Supreme Court, see generally Johnson II, 135 S. Ct. 2551

           C. Procedural Default

     For the reasons set forth in Sabetta, 2016 WL 6157454, at

*10-12, the Court concludes that Defendant has demonstrated both

cause and prejudice sufficient to excuse any failure to raise



(2015), ACCA and other similarly-worded statutes employing the
terms “violent felony” and “crime of violence” now demand some
results that border on the absurd.       Offenses that may not
require the use of violent force, but result in serious injury
or death may not fall within ACCA’s force clause.     See, e.g.,
United States v. Hernandez-Montes, 831 F.3d 284, 294 (5th Cir.
2016) (holding that Florida second-degree murder is not a crime
of violence requiring a sentencing enhancement); United States
v. Parnell, 818 F.3d 974, 977-78 (9th Cir. 2016) (holding that
Massachusetts armed bank robbery is not a violent felony under
ACCA); United States v. Madrid, 805 F.3d 1204, 1207-08 (10th
Cir. 2015) (holding that Texas aggravated sexual assault of
minor under 14 years old is not a crime of violence for purposes
of a sentencing enhancement); United States v. Braun, 801 F.3d
1301, 1307-08 (11th Cir. 2015) (holding that Florida crimes of
aggravated battery of a pregnant woman and battery on law
enforcement officer are not violent felonies under ACCA). Drug
trafficking offenses, however, remain plainly within the ambit
of ACCA.    See 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1) (stating that a person
convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm who “has
three previous convictions by any court . . . for a violent
felony or a serious drug offense, or both” shall be sentenced to
a minimum of fifteen years’ imprisonment.      As a result, the
instant Defendant may have a viable argument that, because a
second-degree murder conviction in Rhode Island can stand where
a parent was convicted of second-degree murder on a felony-
murder theory after a child died of starvation as a result of
the parent’s drug use and consequent severe neglect, see State
v. Stewart, 663 A.2d 912, 916 (R.I. 1995), second-degree murder
does not properly fall within ACCA’s force clause. A three-time
drug trafficker, on the other hand, would assuredly face a
minimum of fifteen years in prison with a potential for life
imprisonment.   Given the anomalous, even absurd, and grossly
unfair results being generated by post-Johnson II decisions,
Congress may wish to consider amending the enumerated offenses
clause of ACCA to include those crimes, such as murder, which
previously were understood to fall squarely within the residual
clause.

these arguments at sentencing or on direct appeal.             Accordingly,

this motion is not barred by procedural default and Defendant is

entitled to relief.

     III. Conclusion

     For   the   foregoing   reasons,    the   Court   holds    that   Rhode

Island assault by an inmate does not constitute a violent felony

under ACCA.      The Court will schedule a hearing on Defendant’s

motion to vacate and re-sentencing forthwith.

IT IS SO ORDERED.
