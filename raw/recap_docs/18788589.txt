                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE




United States of America

     v.                                   Criminal No. 06-133-01-PB

Andre Laventure


                                  O R D E R


     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

September 6, 2006 trial in the above case, citing the need for

additional time to engage in plea negotiations.            The government

does not object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reason and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from September 6, 2006 to December 5, 2006.

In agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial
