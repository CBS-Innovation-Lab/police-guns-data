                    DEFENDANT         )


                        ORDER TO SEAL AND REDACT

      After reviewing the file, I note that page 2 of the signed copy of the search

warrant (Docket Item 45) includes the dates of birth and addresses of two

individuals. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 49.1 requires that counsel redact

personal identifier information from documents filed with the court. Accordingly,

the Clerk’s Office is ORDERED to SEAL the signed copy of the search warrant

(Docket Item 45).    The defendant’s attorney is ORDERED to file on or before

December 21, 2009, another copy of the document with the dates of birth and

addresses redacted from page 2.

      SO ORDERED.

      DATED THIS 17TH DAY OF DECEMBER, 2009
