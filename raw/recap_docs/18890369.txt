                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 08-cr-24-PB

Corey Gagnon



                                  O R D E R

     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

trial scheduled for January 6, 2009, citing the need for

additional time to finalize a plea agreement.            The government

does not object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reason and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from January 6, 2009 to February 3, 2009.              In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
