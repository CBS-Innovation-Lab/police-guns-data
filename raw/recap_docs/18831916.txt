                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 07-cr-054-PB

Walter Nichols


                                  O R D E R


     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

September 5, 2007 trial in the above case, citing the need for

additional time to complete a domestic violence group counseling

program in which he has been participating and to engage in plea

negotiations or prepare for trial.          The government does not

object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reasons and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from September 5, 2007 to December 4, 2007.

In agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial
