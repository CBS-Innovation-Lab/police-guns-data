Saris, Chief Judge.

              Defendant Mahiri Kazana pled guilty in 2009 to conspiracy

to distribute cocaine base and possession with intent to

distribute cocaine base. As a pro se1 petitioner, he now seeks to

vacate that guilty plea on the basis of recent revelations

concerning chemist Annie Dookhan and the William F. Hinton Drug

Laboratory in Jamaica Plain (Docket No. 555). Specifically,

Kazana contends, his plea was invalid because the government had

not yet informed him of Dookhan’s misconduct, relevant since

Dookhan was a primary analyst on certain drug samples in the

case. Kazana now claims he would have opted for trial had he

known of the Dookhan scandal. The government did not file an

opposition. Based on the memorandum submitted by the petitioner

and the record in this case, the Court DENIES Kazana’s motion to

vacate.

                               BACKGROUND

     The facts surrounding this case are largely undisputed and

are drawn from the presentencing report and indictment.

     In fall 2006, law enforcement agencies investigated an

individual named Husie Joyner who headed up a large powder

cocaine and crack cocaine distribution ring. Kazana was one of

Joyner’s customers. As a result of phone calls between Kazana

and Joyner, Kazana was charged in a sixteen-count indictment on

September 8, 2005, naming 15 other co-defendants.

     Kazana’s first two drug-trafficking offenses relate to an

individual investigation of Kazana on November 6, 2003, where

the Boston Police Department seized three substances inside a

coffee can and a semi-automatic pistol with an obliterated

serial number from his residence at 145 Navarre Street. The

Massachusetts State Laboratory determined these substances to be

12.67 grams of crack cocaine, 145.94 grams of powder cocaine,

and 246.65 grams of powder cocaine.

     Kazana’s third offense relates to a seizure that took place

on June 2, 2005 after Boston police officers conducted a traffic

                                    2

stop of Kazana. After learning that Kazana’s license was

suspended, officers arrested Kazana and discovered a substance

in the waistband of his underwear, which the Massachusetts State

Laboratory later determined to be 14.21 grams of crack cocaine.

     On June 17, 2009, Kazana pled guilty to counts 1, 10, and

17 of the sixteen charges: one count of conspiracy to distribute

over 50 grams of cocaine base in 2003; one count of possession

with intent to distribute over 5 grams of cocaine base in 2005;

and one count of possession with intent to distribute over 50

grams of cocaine base in 2003. Kazana was sentenced to 132

months incarceration, which was below the 262-327 month range in

the Sentencing Guidelines.

     Three years later in August, 2012, the news broke that

chemist Annie Dookhan had falsely certified drug test results

and tampered with samples at the Hinton Drug Lab in Jamaica

Plain. On August 20, 2013, Kazana sought to vacate his guilty

plea as to three related drug trafficking counts and obtain a

new trial pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §2255. In March, 2014, the

Massachusetts Inspector General (OIG) released a report

following an investigation of the lab, which stated in part that

Dookhan was the sole bad actor, and that there was no evidence

that any other chemist at the Hinton Drug lab committed any

malfeasance. Kazana did not supplement his motion with any

additional factual support after the report was released and

defense counsel withdrew at Kazana’s request on April 30, 2014.

(Docket No. 621). Kazana has completed his sentence and

currently resides in Maryland while on supervised release.

                        III.   LEGAL STANDARDS

     Title 28 U.S.C. § 2255(a) permits a prisoner to

collaterally attack his sentence when it “(1) was imposed in

violation of the Constitution, or (2) was imposed by a court

that lacked jurisdiction, or (3) exceeded the statutory maximum,

or (4) was otherwise subject to collateral attack.” David v.

United States, 134 F.3d 470, 474 (1st Cir. 1998). The petitioner

bears the burden to make out a case for relief under § 2255. Id.

     Generally speaking, “a voluntary and intelligent plea of

guilty made by an accused person, who has been advised by

competent counsel, may not be collaterally attacked.”          Mabry v.

Johnson, 467 U.S. 504, 508 (1984), overruled in part on other

grounds by Puckett v. United States, 556 U.S. 129 (2009). But a

prisoner who pleaded guilty may still “collaterally attack his

sentence on the ground that his guilty plea was not knowing or

voluntary if is his claim is based on evidence not available to

him at the time of the plea.” Ferrara v. United States, 456 F.3d

278, 289 (1st Cir. 2006).

     To prevail on this ground, a defendant must make two

showings. “First, he must show that some egregiously

impermissible conduct (say, threats, blatant misrepresentations,

                                    4
 
      Case 1:05-cr-10239-PBS Document 707 Filed 12/03/15 Page 5 of 7



or untoward blandishments by government agents) antedated the

entry of his plea.” Id. at 290. “Second, he must show that the

misconduct influenced his decision to plead guilty or, put

another way, that it was material to that choice.” Id. To

satisfy this second prong of materiality, a defendant must

establish “a reasonable probability that, but for [the

misconduct], he would not have pleaded guilty and would have

insisted on going to trial.” Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 59

(1985). “A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to

undermine confidence in a belief that the petitioner would have

entered a plea.” Ferrara, 456 F.3d at 294.

     “In mounting an inquiry into these elements, a court must

consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the

plea.” Ferrara, 456 F.3d at 290. Relevant factors include, but

are not limited to, whether the withheld information: (1) would

have detracted from the factual basis used to support the plea;

(2) could have been used to impeach a witness whose credibility

may have been outcome-determinative; (3) was cumulative of other

evidence already in the defendant’s possession; (4) would have

influenced counsel’s recommendation as to the desirability of

accepting a particular plea bargain; and (5) was outweighed by

the benefits of entering into the plea agreement. Id. at 294.

                               DISCUSSION

     Kazana argues that his guilty plea should be vacated

because it was not voluntary, knowing, and intelligent under

Ferrara. This argument is unsuccessful.

     For one thing, even though Dookhan was the primary chemist

on the test conducted for the 14.21 gram amount of crack cocaine

seized from Kazana on June 2, 2005, she was not involved at all

in the testing done on the other two substance amounts of 145.94

grams and 246.65 grams. Under the marijuana equivalency chart

set forth in U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(3), the latter two substance

amounts together determined the petitioner’s offense category

notwithstanding the 14.21 grams tested by Dookhan. Excluding the

Dookhan analysis makes no difference for Kazana’s sentence.2 As

this Court recently held in United States v. Jackson, “there is

no reasonable probability that [the petitioner] would proceed to

trial when the government can present drug test results from

evidence that was never touched by Dookhan.” 54 F. Supp. 3d 102,

108 (D. Mass. 2014) (denying habeas petition where substances

  Moreover, the government stated at the hearing, at which the
petitioner was not present, that the substances tested at the
Hinton Drug Lab were also retested at the Massachusetts State
Police laboratory, which confirmed that they were cocaine. See
United States v. Wilkins, 754 F.3d 24, 29, (D. Mass. 2014)
(denying habeas petition under Ferrara where there was “powerful
circumstantial evidence” of defendant’s guilt and where second
round of testing on samples untouched by Dookhan yielded
positive cocaine results).

belonging to petitioner were confirmed by non-suspect drug test

results).

     Most importantly, Kazana concedes that he is a career

offender, which placed him in a higher sentencing guideline

range irrespective of the weight of the substances seized from

him. See Docket No. 521; Pre-Sentencing Report ¶¶ 201-205. For

these reasons, Kazana’s Ferrara argument fails.

     Kazana also argues that the government failed to turn over

other evidence of misconduct at the Hinton Laboratories in

violation of his right to due process under Brady v. Maryland,

373 U.S. 83 (1963) (prosecutor must disclose exculpatory or

impeachment evidence). However, he does not detail in his motion

precisely what information was allegedly withheld from him that

might have influenced his decision whether to go to trial. For

this reason, his Brady-based due process argument fails.

                                  ORDER

     For the foregoing reason, the petitioner’s motion for

relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (Docket No. 555) is DENIED.
