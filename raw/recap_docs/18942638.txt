                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 09-cr-188-PB

John Selden

                                  O R D E R

     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

trial scheduled for March 2, 2010, citing a scheduling conflict

and the need for additional time to engage in plea negotiations

prior to trial. The government does not object to a continuance

of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reasons, the court will continue

the trial from June 2, 2010 to July 7, 2010.           In agreeing to

continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ยง

3161(h)(7)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the ends of

justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the best

interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.

     The May 19, 2010 final pretrial conference is continued to

June 21, 2010 at 3:30 p.m.
