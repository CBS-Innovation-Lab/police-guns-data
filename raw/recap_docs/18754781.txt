                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                        DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                                   Criminal No. 05-cr-045-01-PB

Zbigniew May

                                  O R D E R

     Defendant appeared for a bail revocation hearing pursuant to

18 U.S.C. ยง 3148.       Defendant admitted to the violations.            Given

his two violations for marijuana use, this DUI indicates that the

number of failed opportunities to comply with conditions I find

that the defendant is unlikely to abide by any condition or

combination of conditions.        The conditions of release are

revoked.

     Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the defendant be detained

pending trial.

     The defendant is committed to the custody of the Attorney

General or his designated representative for confinement in a

corrections facility separate, to the extent practicable, from

persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody

pending appeal.      The defendant shall be afforded a reasonable

opportunity for private consultation with defense counsel.                On

order of a court of the United States or on request of an
        Case 1:05-cr-00045-PB Document 15 Filed 11/09/05 Page 2 of 2




attorney for the government, the person in charge of the

corrections facility shall deliver the defendant to the United

States Marshal for the purpose of an appearance in connection

with a court proceeding.

      SO ORDERED.
