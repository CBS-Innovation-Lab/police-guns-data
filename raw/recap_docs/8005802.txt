                       IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                         FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO

 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
 Plaintiff,                                       CRIM. NO. 97-0072

 v.

 JUAN R. MERCED MORALES
 Defendant.


                                  INFORMATIVE MOTION

TO THE HONORABLE COURT:

       COMES NOW, the United States of America, through the undersigned attorneys, and before

this Honorable Court very respectfully states and prays as follows:

       1. On February 4, 2008, the undersigned filed a motion to request an extension of time to

answer defendant’s motion for reduction of sentence under the new crack cocaine guidelines. The

request for extension of time was granted by this Honorable Court. See, Dockets No. 744 & 745.

       2. Thereafter, on February 15, 2008, the Honorable Chief United States District Judge, José

A. Fusté entered an Administrative Directive that will guide the process of implementing the

retroactivity of the crack amendment.

       3. The process requires that the United States Probation Office prepares a “retroactivity

package” (consisting of the Pre-sentence Investigation Report, Judgment and Commitment Order,

Plea Agreement, Indictment, and Sentencing Transcript), which should include a recommendation

related to the defendant’s eligibility for the benefits of the retroactive crack cocaine guideline

amendment. Thereafter, the Federal Public Defender and the undersigned should meet to consider

and announce any stipulated disposition.

       4. Since the “retroactivity package” has not been filed with a recommendation as to the
     Case 3:97-cr-00072-SEC           Document 747         Filed 03/05/2008       Page 2 of 3




disposition, the United States hereby submits that instead of filing a response at this time, it will

follow the procedure established in the Administrative Directive once the Probation Office files the

retroactivity package in this case, as required therein.

       WHEREFORE, the United States respectfully requests from the Court to take notice of the

above, and to issue any Order which may be deemed appropriate.

       RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED.

       In San Juan, Puerto Rico, this 5th day of March, 2008.
