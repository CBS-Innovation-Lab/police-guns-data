                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 08-cr-96-PB

Anthony Sawyer


                                   O R D E R


     The defendant has moved, through counsel, to continue the

trial scheduled for November 3, 2009, citing the need for

additional time to complete a review of defendant’s medical

status and, with the aid of expert services, prepare a defense.

The government does not object to a continuance of the trial

date.

     Accordingly, for the above reasons and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from November 3, 2009 to January 5, 2010.             In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. § 3161(h)(7)(A) that for the above-stated reason, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
