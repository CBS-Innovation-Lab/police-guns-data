GORTON, J.

     One of the defendants in this case, Carlos Landan

(“Landan”), is charged with firearm possession and drug offenses.

He has moved to suppress items seized during the search of his

home and statements made to police on the grounds that the search

was conducted without a warrant and without his consent, that the

statements were not preceded by the giving of Miranda warnings

and that any statements made were involuntary.         This Court

conducted an evidentiary hearing on October 30, 2009.

I.   Background

     A.   Factual Background

     Landan was arrested on the morning of December 7, 2007 in

Haverill, Massachusetts, as part of an investigation by the

Federal Bureau of Investigation’s North Shore Gang Task Force

(“the FBI Gang Task Force”).      The arrest was made pursuant to a

warrant and effectuated by the Massachusetts State Police (“MSP”)


                                   -1-
     Case 1:07-cr-10407-NMG Document 80 Filed 11/12/09 Page 2 of 10



Special Tactics and Operations Program (“STOP Team”).         That unit

was called on because of concerns about Landan’s history of

violence and, in particular, his prior conviction for assault and

battery with a dangerous weapon which involved the near fatal

stabbing of an undercover MSP trooper.

     At approximately 6:00 a.m. on the morning of the arrest,

members of the STOP Team, without knocking or announcing their

presence, entered Landan’s residence.      Landan was in bed with his

girlfriend and the mother of his child, Marisol Crespo

(“Crespo”).   Police entered the bedroom, arrested Landan and

subsequently handcuffed him.     He was then separated from Crespo

who was taken to another room in the apartment with some

children.

     After Landan was arrested and the apartment secured by the

STOP Team, Lieutenant Ernest Doherty (“Doherty”) of the MSP and

Special Agent Darwin Suelen (“Suelen”) of the FBI assumed control

of the scene.   Doherty testified that he then advised Landan of

his Miranda rights and that Landan responded that he understood

those rights.   In response to questions, Landan told Doherty that

there was cocaine and a gun in the apartment.

     Landan was subsequently taken to the living room area.

Although no search warrant had been issued for Landan’s

residence, Doherty testified that he asked Landan if he would

consent to a search of the apartment and Landan answered


                                  -2-
     Case 1:07-cr-10407-NMG Document 80 Filed 11/12/09 Page 3 of 10



affirmatively.   According to Doherty, Suelen also showed Landan a

consent to search form and an “advise of rights” form and read

them both to him.   Landan purportedly said that he understood his

rights and consented to a search of the apartment.        After

discussing whether to “un-cuff” Landan so he could sign the

forms, Suelen and Doherty demurred for the sake of officer

safety.   Doherty instead signed both forms as a “witnessing

officer” in the presence of Suelen.

     Although he did not testify at the hearing, Landan asserts

in an affidavit that he repeatedly declined to assent to a search

when officers asked for his permission.      The parties do not

dispute, however, that Crespo did orally consent to a search and

sign a consent-to-search form.

     The apartment was searched and law enforcement officers

found a firearm, ammunition, cocaine and a scale in a bedroom

closet.   Landan has moved to suppress that evidence as well as

the statements he made to police.

     B.    Procedural History

     Landan was indicted on December 6, 2007 and a Superseding

Indictment was returned on August 14, 2008.       Landan filed the

pending motion to suppress on April 17, 2009, along with an

affidavit and an affidavit of his then-counsel Larry Tipton.          The

government filed an opposition to that motion on May 4, 2009,

along with an affidavit from Doherty.      An evidentiary hearing was


                                  -3-
      Case 1:07-cr-10407-NMG Document 80 Filed 11/12/09 Page 4 of 10



held on October 30, 2009 and the parties subsequently submitted

supplemental memoranda.

II.   Analysis

      In moving to suppress physical evidence and statements made

to the police, Landan argues that: 1) the search was conducted

without a warrant and without his consent, 2) he was not given

the required Miranda warnings before he made the statements, 3)

if there was consent or a waiver under Miranda, it was

involuntary and 4) the officers’ violation of the “knock and

announce rule”, although not mandating suppression, requires some

alternate remedy.      The Court considers those arguments seriatim.

      A.   Consent to Search Landan’s Residence

           1.      Legal Standard

      Although searches without a warrant are presumptively

unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, “[c]onsensual searches

are a recognized exception to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant

requirement.”      United States v. Vanvliet, 542 F.3d 259, 264 (1st

Cir. 2008).      The government bears the burden of proving, by a

preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant gave his

consent voluntarily.

      Voluntariness is a question of fact that turns on the

totality of the circumstances attending the interaction between

the defendant and searching officers.       Id.   Consent is not

voluntary if it is either coerced or was granted only in


                                    -4-
         Case 1:07-cr-10407-NMG Document 80 Filed 11/12/09 Page 5 of 10



submission to a claim of lawful authority.           Schneckloth v.

Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 233 (1973).          Consent is voluntary where

the defendant makes an “essentially free and unconstrained choice

[and his will has not] been overborne and his capacity for

self-determination [not] critically impaired.”            United States v.

Forbes, 181 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1999) (citations and quotations

omitted).

             2.    Application

     It is undisputed that the search of Landan’s residence was

not pursuant to a search warrant although the arrest was made

pursuant to a warrant.        Thus, Landan’s motion turns first on

whether he consented (as Doherty testified) or objected (as he

contends by affidavit) to the search of the apartment.1             For the

government, Doherty both submitted an affidavit and testified

that Landan consented to the search.          He contends that due to a

fear for officer safety, however, Landan was not un-cuffed to

sign the consent form.

     Landan rebuts the government’s proof by 1) submitting an

affidavit asserting that he continuously refused to allow the

search and 2) seeking, at the evidentiary hearing, to cast doubt



     1
        Although the government also maintains that the search
was justified based upon Crespo’s written consent, the Court
declines to rely on that assertion because consent by a co-tenant
cannot justify a search if the other tenant refuses, as Landan
alleges here. See Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U.S. 103, 114-15
(2006).

     Case 1:07-cr-10407-NMG Document 80 Filed 11/12/09 Page 6 of 10



on Doherty’s testimony.    Specifically, he questions the officers’

so-called safety concerns with respect to un-cuffing him under

the circumstances in which 1) several heavily-armed officers were

present in the apartment, 2) his prior stabbing of an officer

(the only basis given for officer safety concerns) was over ten

years prior to his arrest and the victim was acting undercover

and 3) Landan was seated, calm and very cooperative.         Thus, with

no reason to be fearful, Landan contends, reasonable officers

would have had him sign the form.       Their failure to do so

arguably implies that Landan actually withheld his consent.

     Although Landan has forcefully questioned the reasonableness

of the decision to keep him handcuffed, the Court finds Doherty’s

affidavit and sworn testimony on the witness stand to have been

credible.   See, e.g., United States v. Hemmings, No. 07-cr-

421(NG)(JMA), 2009 WL 1616517, at *6-7 (E.D.N.Y. June 9, 2009)

(finding a testifying officer more credible than the affidavit of

a defendant who chooses not to testify at a suppression hearing

even though he was entitled to do so without the risk that it be

used against him at trial).    Accordingly, the Court finds that,

by a preponderance of the evidence, the government has shown that

Landan gave his consent to search the apartment.

     That does not, however, end the inquiry because Landan

contends that, even if the Court finds that he consented to the

search, such consent was involuntary.       He points again to the


                                  -6-
        Case 1:07-cr-10407-NMG Document 80 Filed 11/12/09 Page 7 of 10



circumstances of the arrest, particularly to the presence of many

heavily armed officers.       The Court is unpersuaded.      In fact, the

circumstances upon which Landan relies as supporting his argument

that he did not consent to the search contradict his argument

here.     He was calm and cooperative and the fact that armed

officers were in the apartment or had roused him from bed moments

before does not render involuntary his statements given in a non-

confrontational, controlled setting.         Thus, the Court finds that

his consent was not unconstitutionally coerced.

     B.      Statements to Police

             1.    Legal Standard

     The familiar requirements of Miranda v. Arizona, provide

that a criminal defendant must be advised of certain rights prior

to being subjected to custodial interrogation.           384 U.S. 436, 444

(1966).     Questioning may thereafter proceed only if the defendant

makes a voluntary, knowing and intelligent waiver of those

rights.     Id.   The government bears the burden of proving a waiver

of Miranda by a preponderance of the evidence.           United States v.

Downs-Moses, 329 F.3d 253, 267 (1st Cir. 2003).           If the court

finds no Miranda violation “then the standard shifts” and only

confessions procured by coercive tactics will be excluded.               See

id. (“For example, police may not get a Miranda waiver and then

beat a confession out of a suspect....”).

     Here, there is no dispute that the questioning of Landan


                                     -7-
     Case 1:07-cr-10407-NMG Document 80 Filed 11/12/09 Page 8 of 10



after his arrest qualifies as custodial interrogation.         Rather,

the issue is identical to that of consent: Doherty’s testimony

that Landan was advised and read his rights (but not required to

sign a form) is disputed by Landan’s affidavit.        For the same

reasons outlined above, the Court credits Doherty’s testimony

over Landan’s affidavit and, accordingly, finds that the

government has demonstrated that Miranda warnings were given.

     Landan again urges that his statements should be suppressed

because they were the “result of coercion and not voluntarily

made” due to the circumstances surrounding the arrest.         The Court

reiterates that this argument lacks merit.       The actions taken by

police were a far cry from the sort of “physical or psychological

pressure” that would justify a finding that Landan’s statements

were involuntary and not a product of free choice.        See Moran,

475 U.S. at 421; cf. Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U.S. 385, 401 (1978).

     C.   Knock and Announce Violation

     In addition to seeking the suppression of physical evidence

and statements made to law enforcement, Landan requests a remedy

for the officers’ alleged violation of the so-called “knock and

announce” rule.   Specifically, he seeks a ruling that there was a

“knock and announce” violation that should be presented to the

jury at trial.

     Both the Fourth Amendment and federal law require that, in

most circumstances, police officers armed with a warrant must


                                  -8-
     Case 1:07-cr-10407-NMG Document 80 Filed 11/12/09 Page 9 of 10



knock and announce their presence before entering a suspect’s

residence.   See 18 U.S.C. § 3109; Wilson v. Arkansas, 514 U.S.

927, 934 (1995).   Several exceptions to the rule have developed

to relieve officers of that burden where compliance would prove

unhelpful or dangerous.    Officers are not required to knock and

announce their presence

     under circumstances presenting a threat of physical
     violence, or where police officers have reason to believe
     that evidence would likely be destroyed if advance notice
     were given.

Richards v. Wisconsin, 520 U.S. 385, 391 (1997) (citation and

internal quotation marks omitted).

     Here, the Court is persuaded by the government’s contention

that the failure to knock and announce was justified by a threat

of physical violence to police officers due to Landan’s prior

conviction for assault and battery with a deadly weapon in

connection with a near fatal stabbing of a MSP Trooper.         That

criminal history is sufficient to give police a “reasonable

suspicion that knocking and announcing their presence, under the

particular circumstances, would be dangerous.”        See Richards, 520

U.S. at 394.   Consequently, the knock and announce rule was not

violated and Landan is entitled to no affirmative remedy.
