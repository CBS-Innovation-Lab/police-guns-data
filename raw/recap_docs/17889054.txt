             ORDER ON DEFENDANTâ€™S REQUEST FOR EARLY
               TERMINATION OF SUPERVISED RELEASE


      The defendant has requested early termination of his supervised release.

At this date, he has less than two months remaining on his term of supervised

release. I believe it best that he successfully complete his term as originally

imposed. Accordingly, I DENY the request and encourage Mr. Riffey to complete

his supervision term successfully.

      SO ORDERED.

      DATED THIS 31ST DAY OF MARCH, 2014
