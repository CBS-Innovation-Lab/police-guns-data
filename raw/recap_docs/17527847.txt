 ORDER AFFIRMING RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE


      On October 31, 2010, the United States Magistrate Judge filed with the
court, with copies to counsel, his Amended Recommended Decision on Motion
to Suppress.
      The defendant filed his objection to the Recommended Decision on
January 14, 2011.      I have reviewed and considered the Recommended
Decision, together with the entire record; I have made a de novo determination
of all matters adjudicated by the Recommended Decision; and I concur with the
recommendations of the United States Magistrate Judge for the reasons set
forth in the Recommended Decision, and determine that no further proceeding
is necessary.
      It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the Magistrate
Judge is hereby ADOPTED. The defendantâ€™s motion to suppress is DENIED.
      By February 7, 2011, the parties shall SHOW CAUSE why footnote 3 of the
Amended Report and Recommendation needs to remain sealed.
      SO ORDERED.

      DATED THIS 31ST DAY OF JANUARY, 2011
