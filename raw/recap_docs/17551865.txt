STEPHEN L. VOISINE                       )

                          ORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS

          On March 11, 2011, Stephen L. Voisine pleaded guilty to both counts of a two

count information. Count I charged him with possession of a firearm after having

been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence in violation of 18 U.S.C.

§ 922(g)(9) and Count II charged him with shooting and killing a bald eagle in

violation of 16 U.S.C. § 668(a). Information (Docket # 2). On March 15, 2011, Mr.

Voisine moved to dismiss Count I of the information. Mot. to Dismiss Count I of the

Information (Docket # 10). The Government responded on April 5, 2011, and Mr.

Voisine replied to the response on April 11, 2011. Gov’t’s Resp. to Def.’s Mot. to

Dismiss (Docket # 12); Def.’s Reply to Gov’t’s Resp. to Mot. to Dismiss (Docket # 13).

          Mr Voisine first claims that the charge infringes his Second Amendment

right to bear arms. He next contends that the information fails to state a federal

offense because the First Circuit’s decision in United States v. Nason,1 which

concluded that a conviction under Maine’s assault statute constitutes a

“misdemeanor crime of domestic violence” under federal law, is no longer binding on

this Court. Instead, he asserts that in interpreting the term, “physical force,” as it

appears in the firearms possession statute, the Court must apply the construction


1   269 F.3d 10 (2001).
the United States Supreme Court in Johnson v. United States2 and the First Circuit

in United States v. Holloway3 gave the same term for purposes of the Armed Career

Criminal Act (ACCA), and if it does so, Count I must be dismissed because the

Defendant has not committed a predicate crime.

          The Court considered these exact issues in denying a motion to dismiss the

indictment in United States v. Bryant, 1:11-cr-00021-JAW.         In fact, the legal

arguments presented by both Mr. Voisine and the Government in this motion are

precisely the same as those presented in Bryant. Moreover, there are no factual

differences distinguishing this case from Bryant.           Accordingly, the Court

incorporates its reasoning in Bryant and DENIES Mr. Voisine’s Motion to Dismiss

Count I of the Information (Docket # 10).

          SO ORDERED.
