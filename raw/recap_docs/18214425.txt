Property.

        6.        Any person, other than the defendant, asserting a legal interest in the Property

may, within 30 days of the final publication of notice or receipt of notice, whichever is earlier,

in the Property.

petitioner's right, title or interest in the Property, the time and circumstances of the petitioner's

acquisition of the right, title or interest in the Property and any additional facts supporting the

petitioner's claim and the relief sought.

        8.        After disposition of any motion filed under Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.2(c)(1)(A) and

before a hearing on the petition, discovery may be conducted in accordance with the Federal

Rules of Civil Procedure upon a showing that such discovery is necessary or desirable to resolve

factual issues.
