                  ORDER AFFIRMING THE
       RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE

         The United States Magistrate Judge filed with the Court on July 22,

   2015 his Recommended Decision (ECF No. 99).      Ms. Sutherland filed her

   objections to the Recommended Decision on August 5, 2015 (ECF No. 103).

   The Government filed its response to the objections on August 24, 2015 (ECF

   No. 105).    I have reviewed and considered the Magistrate Judge’s

   Recommended Decision, together with the entire record; I have made a de

   novo determination of all matters adjudicated by the Magistrate Judge’s

   Recommended Decision; and I concur with the recommendations of the

   United States Magistrate Judge for the reasons set forth in his

   Recommended Decision, and determine that no further proceeding is

   necessary.

         1.     It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the
                Magistrate Judge (ECF No. 99) is hereby AFFIRMED.

         2.     It is further ORDERED that the Defendant’s Motion to Suppress
                (ECF No. 62) be and hereby is DENIED.
