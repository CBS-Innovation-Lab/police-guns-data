                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 09-cr-51-PB

Jamie Hrycuna


                                  O R D E R

     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

trial scheduled for October 6, 2009, citing the need for

additional time following the September 25, 2009 suppression

hearing to review the case and engage in plea negotiations or

prepare for trial.       The government does not object to a

continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reasons and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from October 6, 2009 to November 3, 2009.             In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
