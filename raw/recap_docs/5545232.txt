       B      Total Amount of Restitution:

       C      Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

              1     G    For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
                         identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

              2     G    For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
                         issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
                         that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(B).

              3     G    For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
                         ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh
                         the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(1)(B)(ii).

              4     G    Restitution is not ordered for other reasons. (Explain.)




       D      G     Partial restitution is ordered for these reasons (18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)):

 1                              FINDINGS OF FACT

 2                THE COURT:    Mr. Fowler, will you please please

 3   stand.    You're committed to the custody of the Bureau of

 4   Prisons for 60 months on Count 1 and Count 2 to be served

 5   concurrently, as I said, to be concurrent with the term of

 6   imprisonment imposed in 04-10308, that the service of the

 7   instant sentence begin as of today.          I'll make the same

 8   recommendation as Judge Tauro that you be assigned to a

 9   medical facility that can address your various medical

10   conditions, that upon your release from imprisonment you

11   shall be placed on supervised release for three years, also

12   to run concurrently with the, is that right, Judge Tauro

13   also imposed three years?

14                MR. LANG:    Yes, your Honor.

15                THE COURT:    To run concurrently with the term of

16   supervised release of Judge Tauro and -- well, I will read

17   Judge Tauro's conditions because I want to make certain that

18   there's not inconsistent provisions between my sentence and

19   this.    You're not to possess a firearm, ammunition,

20   destructive device or any other dangerous weapon.

21                You're to cooperate in the collection of DNA by

22   probation.     You're to follow the standard provisions of

23   supervised release, and, in addition, on supervised release

24   you're to participate in a mental health treatment program

25   which would include an anger management component as
Case 1:05-cr-10145-NG    Document 18-2     Filed 04/17/2008   Page 3 of 3

                                                                                3




 1   directed by probation, you're required to contribute to the

 2   cost of service for such treatment based on your ability to

 3   pay or the availability of third-party payment.                You're to

 4   use your true name, and you're prohibited from the use of

 5   any false identifying information.            The special assessment

 6   here is $200, which shall be due immediately.

 7               Just so that it's clear, you're not to unlawfully

 8   possess a controlled substance, you're to refrain from any

 9   unlawful use of a controlled substance, submit to one drug

10   testing within 15 days of your release and at least two

11   periodic drug tests thereafter, not to exceed 104 tests per

12   year.   You're to report to the probation office in the

13   district to which you've been released within 72 hours of

14   your release and shall not commit another federal, state or

15   local crime.       There is no fine here and no restitution.           You

16   have a right to appeal, and your lawyer will let you know

17   what that consist of.       Thank you all very much.
