United States of America

Anthony R. Capobianco


                                        ORDER



       Defendant's assented-to motion to continue the trial (document no. 21) is granted.

Trial has been rescheduled for the November 2007 trial period. Defendant shall file a

Waiver of Speedy Trial Rights not later than September 5, 2007. On the filing of such

the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ยง

3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would unreasonably deny the

defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective preparation taking into account the
