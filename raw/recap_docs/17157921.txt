                         MEMORANDUM REGARDING
                       SENTENCE RECONSIDERATION

                             January 9, 2008

PONSOR, D.J.
    This is an action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 or,

alternatively, a Motion for Resentencing Pursuant to Fed. R.

Crim. P. 35(a), in which Petitioner claims that his sentence

was incorrectly enhanced following an erroneous determination

that he was a career offender.            In brief,     Petitioner argues
that this career offender designation violated                Shepard v.
United States, 544 U.S. 13 (2005), and                  Taylor v. United

States, 495 U.S. 575 (1990).

    The record is undisputed that Petitioner’s counsel at
sentencing      did   not   raise   the   Taylor/Shepard     issue.     In

addition, the court has found that Petitioner’s sentencing
attorney   failed      to   file    any   notice   of    appeal,   despite
Petitioner’s express instruction to counsel that he do so.

The court addressed counsel’s failure to file the notice of
appeal by vacating and reimposing the same initial sentence

and instructing the clerk to file an appropriate notice of
appeal.1      As a result, the Taylor/Shepard issue is now before
the First Circuit Court of Appeals as part of Petitioner’s

direct      appeal    in   the   criminal    case.      United    States       v.

McGarrett, First Circuit No. 07-1401.
      Petitioner argues that, despite the pendency of the

direct appeal, this court should itself tackle the substantive
Taylor/Shepard issue.            This court is reluctant to take this

approach, which could result in both the Court of Appeals and

the trial court working on the same issue simultaneously.
      In his oral presentation on January 7, 2008, counsel for

the government indicated, without making any commitment, that

the   government       was    considering     an     acknowledgment       of    a
Taylor/Shepard error at sentencing in its submission to the

First Circuit.        The government brief is currently due before
the Court of Appeals on January 24, 2008.

      In light of this complex situation, this court will do

two things. First, the court invites the First Circuit, if it

wishes, to consider a remand of the Taylor/Shepard issue to
this court for prompt reconsideration.                  From Petitioner’s

viewpoint, immediate action is crucial, since a recalculation

      Judgment in this case technically entered on February
23, 2007, following the court’s action. However, on October
26, 2007, the court allowed Petitioner’s motion for leave to
file a motion for correction of his sentence.

of his sentence without the career offender status may result
in a sentence below the number of months he has already

served.2

    Second,      this   case    has   been   scheduled     for   a   status
conference to take place on February 8, 2008 at 2:00 p.m.                At

that time, both parties will be able to report as to the
government’s position with regard to the Taylor/Shepard issue
and the status of the appellate proceedings.

    It is So Ordered.
