  DATES:        Sentencing Hearing

  9/18/07       Court goes over the posture/procedural history of the case. Court goes over the filings it has received in connection
                with today’s hearing. Court makes rulings on the defendant’s objections to the pre-sentence report. Court calculates
                the advisory guidelines as follows: TOL 30, CH VI, 180-210 months custody, 36-60 months supervised release,
                $15K-$150K fine and $100 special assessment fee. Government argues that the court should accept the parties
                binding plea and impose the 15 year sentence. Defendant addresses the court. Formal sentencing: Court accepts
                the parties binding plea agreement and imposes the 15 year mandatory minimum sentence followed by 60 months

                supervised release on the standard conditions plus the additional conditions imposed by the court. Court does

                impose a fine but does impose the mandatory $100 special assessment fee. Defendant advised of his rights to
                appeal and to counsel that haven’t been waived under the plea agreement.
