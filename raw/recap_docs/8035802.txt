                                    MOTION TO WITHDRAW


       Now comes Bobby Soundara, the Defendant in the above captioned matter, by and through
his counsel, and moves that this Honorable Court grant leave to withdraw the appearance of defense
counsel, Assistant Federal Defender Kevin J. Fitzgerald. An irremediable breakdown in the
attorney-client relationship has occurred to the degree that it is in Mr. Soundaraâ€™s best interests to
have a new attorney appointed to represent him in this matter.
