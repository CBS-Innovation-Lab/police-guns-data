                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                       DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

             v.                              Case No. 08-cr-42-01-SM

Christopher Bosch

                                    ORDER

      Defendant Bosch’s motion to continue the final pretrial conference and trial

is granted (document 22). Trial has been rescheduled for the October 2008 trial

period. Defendant Bosch shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights not later than

September 8, 2008. On the filing of such waiver, his continuance shall be

effective.

      The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18

U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would

unreasonably deny defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances.

      Final Pretrial Conference: September 26, 2008 at 1:30 p.m.

      Jury Selection: October 7, 2008 at 9:30 a.m.
