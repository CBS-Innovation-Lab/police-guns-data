                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                         DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                   Criminal No.     04-cr-106-PB

Mark Young


                                  O R D E R


     On January 26, 2007, defendant appeared for a “probable

cause” hearing under Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.1 on five alleged

violations of conditions of supervision.           Defendant stipulated to

probable cause on the violations.         I therefore find probable

cause to hold him for a revocation hearing.

     Defendant sought bail conditions under Rule 32.1(a)(6).

Under Rule 32.1(a)(6) defendant bears the burden of establishing

by clear and convincing evidence that he will not flee and that

he poses no danger to any other person or to the community.              The

circumstances leading to the defendant’s arrest on the supervised

release violation demonstrate that the defendant is a danger to

the community.      There are no conditions which are likely to

assure his presence and the safety of the community.

      Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the defendant be detained

pending trial.

      The defendant is committed to the custody of the Attorney

General or his designated representative for confinement in a

corrections facility separate, to the extent practicable, from

persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody

pending appeal.     The defendant shall be afforded a reasonable

opportunity for private consultation with defense counsel.             On

order of a court of the United States or on request of an

attorney for the government, the person in charge of the

corrections facility shall deliver the defendant to the United

States Marshal for the purpose of an appearance in connection

with a court proceeding.

      SO ORDERED.
