The offenses were committed in JunefJuly 2010. In August defendant began to serve an 18 months state sentence on
unrelated charges, his first significant sentence Although hc did very well and emerged from prison with a major change in
attitude and maturity, he was charged with this offense a few months after his release from the state sentence In the interim
he had obtained employment and was leading a productive and law-abiding life. The sentence is sufficient punishment and
affords adequate deterrence It will also allow defendant time to pursue his request for vocational training as a welder.

STATEMENT OF REASONS

Vll COURT DETERMINATIONS OF RESTITUTION
A m Restitution Not Applicablc.
B Total Amount ofRestitution:

C Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

I m For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under lS U.S,C. § 3663 A(c)(3)(A).

2 I:_] For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U`S.C, § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex

issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims` losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(B)4

3 EI For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not

ordered because thc complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh
the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(l)(B)(ii),

4 l:l Restitution is not ordered for other reasons (Explain.)

D [i Partial restitution is ordered for these reasons (18 U.S.C. § 3553(0)):

VIII ADDITIONAL FACTS JUSTIFYING THE SENTENCE IN THIS CASE (Ifapplicablc.)

The 4 level enhancement pursuant to 2K2.I(b)(4)(B) is inappropriate because defendant could not under any circumstances be guilty of
this offense. The 2 level enhancement for obstruction was deleted for lack of evidence to show the alleged obstruction As a result
defendant is also entitled to a 3 level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility In sum the total offense level is 19, not 28.

Sections l, II, III, IV, and VII of the Statement of Reasons form must be completed in all felony cases.
