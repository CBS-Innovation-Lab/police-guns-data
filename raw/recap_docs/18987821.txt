                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                        DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

             v.                           Criminal No. 11-cr-43-01-JL

James Spaulding


                                  O R D E R


        The assented to motion to reschedule jury trial (document no.

22 ) filed by defendant is granted; Final Pretrial is rescheduled

to November 29, 2011 at 10am; Trial is continued to the two-week

period beginning December 6, 2011, 09:30. No further continuances.

        Defendant shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights within 10

days.    The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting

a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv), for the

reasons set forth in the motion.

        SO ORDERED.
