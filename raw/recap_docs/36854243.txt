the jurors by removing prospective jurors for cause where actual bias or other
disqualification is shown, or by removing prospective jurors Without cause by
exercising peremptory challenges The jury would have to agree, unanimously,
before it could return a verdict of either guilty or not guilty. The jury would be
instructed that Defendant is presumed innocent, that it could not convict Defendant
unless, after hearing all the evidence, it was persuaded of Defendant’s guilt beyond
a reasonable doubt, and that it was to consider each charge separately.

hearing all the evidence and considering each count separately, determine whether

evidence against Defendant. Defendant would be able to confront those witnesses

STIPULATION OF FACTS

In conjunction with the submission of the accompanying Plea Agreement in this case, the
United States of America submits the following statement setting forth the United States’ version
of the facts leading to Defendant’s acceptance of criminal responsibility. l-lad this matter
proceeded to trial, the United States would have presented evidence through the testimony of
witnesses, law enforcement agents, and experts, as well as physical evidence and documentary
evidence, which would have proven the following beyond a reasonable doubt:

Beginning on a date unknown, but no later than in or about the year 2015, and continuing
up to and until March 2017, Defendant was part of a firearms trafficking organization The purpose
of this group was to purchase firearms in the States of Georgia and Florida, to transport the firearms
to Puerto Rico, and to sell those firearms to other individuals in Puerto Rico, for profit. The
Defendants had roles, which were necessary for the success of the enterprise Through the
testimony of two cooperating witnesses, we will prove that Defendant’s role Was to deliver
firearms in exchange for money. Defendant accepts that he delivered more than three but less than
seven firearms Defendant accepts not being a licensed dealer of firearms within the meaning of
Chapter 44, Title 18, United States Code.

The United States timely provided discovery to De%j
