                     IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                       FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND


UNITED STATES OF AMERICA                           :
                                                   :

                        GOVERNMENT’S OPPOSITION TO
             DEFENDANT’S “MOTION TO REDUCED IMPOSED SENTENCE”

       The    defendant,      convicted       in       2005   of     being       a    felon    in

possession      of   a     firearm    and    sentenced        by    this     Court      to    120

months imprisonment, now claims that his criminal history points

should be recalculated and his sentence correspondingly reduced

based on what he refers to as “November 1st 2007 Retroactive

Amendment      12”   and     “Booker    vs    Booker,         543    U.S.    220       (S.    Ct.

2007).”        In    all    candor,    the    government            has    had       difficulty

understanding the defendant’s arguments.                      In any event, under no

theory is he entitled to a reduction in sentence.

       Defendant’s argument for a sentence reduction is based on

purported changes to U.S.S.G. §4A1.2, entitled “Definitions and

Instructions for Computing Criminal History.”                             Defendant claims

that effective November 1, 2007, this Guideline was amended and

such amendment made retroactive pursuant to “Amendments 9 and

12.”     Defendant’s Memorandum, p. 4.                   The defendant claims that

under these amendments, the Commission has redefined what the
       Case 1:03-cr-00021-S    Document 110     Filed 05/08/2008     Page 2 of 7



term “related cases” means, that such redefinition benefits him

with respect to his criminal history point calculation, and that

he should reap that benefit retroactively.

       Amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines are contained in

Appendix      C   to    the    Guidelines.       A   black      volume       entitled

“Supplement to Appendix C” and containing “Amendments to the

Guidelines Manual effective November 1, 2004, through November

1, 2007” contains neither an “Amendment 9” nor an “Amendment

12”.     There is an Amendment 709, effective November 1, 2007,

which    pertains      to   §4A1.2.1    The     problem   for      the   defendant,

however, is that Amendment 709 does not contain the language he

points to in support of his claim for relief.                      For example, on

page five of his memorandum, the defendant includes a lengthy

quote about related sentences and cites “§4A1.2(A), CMT.N.3.”

The government interprets this               citation to be a citation to

Application Note 3 to §4A1.2.                Yet the language quoted by the

defendant does not appear in Amendment 709.                  Indeed, Amendment

709 strikes Note 3, entitled “Related Cases”, and replaces it

with a new Note 3 entitled “Upward Departure Provision.”                           Nor

does the language relied on by the defendant appear in the blue

Guidelines        Manual,      effective       November      1,      2007,      which

incorporates Amendment 709.            As far as the government can tell,


1
    There is no Amendment 712.

      Case 1:03-cr-00021-S         Document 110         Filed 05/08/2008     Page 3 of 7



the “amendment” the defendant relies on for relief simply does

not exist.             Similarly, the defendant attaches as Exhibit A a

summary      of    a    sentence    imposed       on    him    in   2001     for    malicious

destruction of property, for which he was assigned two criminal

history      points.         This    is   consistent           with    the    Pre-Sentence

Report.      PSR, ¶29.       The government is mystified, however, as to

how the Guidelines as they exist at present would                                   eliminate

these two points from the defendant’s criminal history score.

There is nothing that the government can find in any amendment

to §4A1.2 since the time of the defendant’s original sentencing

that would result in these two points not being included in the

defendant’s criminal history score.

      Furthermore, even if Amendment 709 or some other amendment

did contain the language on which the defendant relies, such

language would be of no help to him, because neither Amendment

709    nor        any    other      amendment          to     §4A1.2   has         been    made

retroactively applicable.              Title 18, United States Code, Section

3582(c)(2) is the avenue by which imprisoned defendants may seek

reduced sentences based on newly amended Guidelines:


             [I]n the case of a defendant who has been
              sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on
              a sentencing range that has subsequently
              been lowered by the Sentencing Commission
              pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of
              the defendant or the Director of the Bureau
              of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court
              may reduce the term of imprisonment, after

                                              3
    Case 1:03-cr-00021-S     Document 110    Filed 05/08/2008   Page 4 of 7



          considering the factors set forth in section
          3553(a)   to  the   extent   that   they are
          applicable,   if   such    a   reduction  is
          consistent with applicable policy statements
          issued by the Sentencing Commission.


18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2)(emphasis added).            The threshold issue for

imprisoned     defendants      seeking      to    benefit       from     amended

Guidelines,    however,       is   whether       the    “applicable      policy

statements    issued    by   the   Sentencing     Commission”     made    those

reduced offense levels retroactive.          Guideline Section 1B1.10 is

the policy statement which governs whether amendments to the

Guidelines apply retroactively.2            For an amended Guideline to

apply retroactively, it must be listed                 in subsection (c) of

Section 1B1.10.    United States v. Crudup, 375 F.3d 5, 9 (1st Cir.

2004); United States v. Gagot, 534 F.Supp.2d 212, 212-13 (D.

Mass. 2008)(noting that U.S.S.G. §1B1.10(a) makes plain “that if

a   Guidelines amendment is not specifically listed as having

retroactive effect in §1B1.10(c), reducing a defendant’s term of

imprisonment pursuant to that amendment does not comport with

the Commission’s policy statements and thus is not authorized by

§ 3582(c)(2).”).       On December 11, 2007, the Commission issued a


2
 Section 1B1.10 is based on 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2), and also
implements 28 U.S.C. § 994(u), which provides: “If the
Commission reduces the term of imprisonment recommended in the
guidelines applicable to a particular offense or category of
offenses, it shall specify in what circumstances and by what
amount the sentences of prisoners serving terms of imprisonment
for the offense may be reduced.”

revised   version     of   §1B1.10.     Exhibit    A.    Subsection     (c)   of

Revised §1B1.10       does not    include    Amendment 709      (or   for that

matter    any   other      amendment    to   §4A1.2)     in     the   list    of

retroactively       applicable   amendments.        Accordingly,      even    if

Amendment 709 or another amendment to §4A1.2 resulted in a more

favorable sentencing range for the defendant, it would be of no

import, because neither Amendment 709 nor any other amendment to

§4A1.2 has been made retroactive by the Sentencing Commission.

     Defendant’s reliance on Booker v. Washington, as well as

another case he cites, the Ninth Circuit’s decision in United

States v. Hicks, 472 F.3d 1167 (9th Cir. 2007), is misplaced.                 It

may well be true that in Hicks, the Ninth Circuit held that

Booker    applies    to    sentencing   hearings    conducted     pursuant    to

Section 3582(c)(2).        The problem for the defendant is that, even

assuming that Hicks were the law in this circuit,3 he is not

entitled to a Section 3582(c)(2) sentencing proceeding, because,

3
 Although the issue need not be decided here, it is worth noting
that the Ninth Circuit is the only Court of Appeals that has
held that Booker applies to re-sentencings under Section 3582.
Several other courts, including one in this Circuit, have held
otherwise.   E.g., United States v. Julien, 2008 WL 1933340 *2
(D. Me. 2008); United States v. Cruz, 2008 WL 539216, **3-5
(E.D.N.Y. 2008).   Furthermore, although the defendant has not
attempted to file a petition for relief under 28 U.S.C. §2255,
Booker would be of no help to him in that context either, given
that it is well-settled in this Circuit and elsewhere that for
purposes of collateral proceedings, Booker does not apply
retroactively. Cirilo-Munoz v. United States, 404 F.3d 527, 533
(1st Cir. 2004)(“Every other circuit that has considered the
issue    has    agreed    that    Booker    does    not    apply
retroactively”)(citing cases).

                                        5

as already noted, there have been no amendments to §4A1.2 that

apply retroactively,

     At bottom, the defendant has been sentenced, and there is

no   available    procedural     mechanism         (nor    for      that      matter

substantive reason) for reducing that sentence.                   The defendant’s

motion should therefore be denied.
