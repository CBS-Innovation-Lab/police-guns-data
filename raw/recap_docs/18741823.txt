                      UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                   FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE




United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 05-cr-098-01-PB

James J. Dorris



                                  O R D E R


     The defendant has moved to continue the August 2, 2005 trial

in the above case.      Defendant cites the need for additional time

to complete discovery and engage in plea negotiations.             The

government does not object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reasons and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from August 2, 2005 to November 1, 2005.              In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
