                 ORDER ON MOTION TO VACATE, SET ASIDE
                        OR CORRECT SENTENCE


      Following the August 9, 2017, Judgment of the First Circuit Court of

Appeals (ECF No. 235), the government has agreed that this defendant,

previously sentenced as an Armed Career Criminal, no longer qualifies for that

enhanced sentence in light of United States v. Windley, 846 F.3d 36 (1st Cir.

2017).     Respondent’s Answer at 1 (ECF No. 245).      He has already served

approximately 95 months, more than the Guideline range of 63-78 months

calculated without Armed Career Criminal status. Id. at 2. Upon the parties’

joint recommendation after consulting with the Probation Office, id. at 2-3, and

the defendant’s written waiver of his right to be present for resentencing (ECF

No. 246), I now GRANT the petitioner/defendant’s motion to vacate, set aside, or

correct sentence (ECF No. 135), and sentence him instead to 96 months

imprisonment to be followed by a 3-year term of supervised release with all the

original conditions and an additional special condition that he spend up to 120
days in community confinement as directed by the Probation Office. The Clerk’s

Office shall prepare an amended Judgment and Commitment accordingly.

     SO ORDERED.

     DATED THIS 1ST DAY OF DECEMBER, 2017
