STATEMENT OF REASONS

Vll COURT DETERMINAT{ONS OF REST|TUTION

A m Restitution Not Applicable.

B 'fotal Amount of Restitution:

C Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

] l:l l"or offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of

identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under lB UiS.(_`i § 3663A(c)(3)(A)
2 ij For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under lS U.S,C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
issues ot` fact and relating them to the cause or amount ot`the victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S`C. § 3663A(c)(3)(t3).
3 l:] For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under |B U`S Ci § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines restitution is not
ordered because the complication and prolongation ofthc sentencing process resulting from the fashioning ofa restitution order outweigh

the needle provide restitution to any victims under lB U.S.C. § 3663(a)(l)(B)(ii)i

4 l:l Restitution is not ordered for other reasons (Explain.)
