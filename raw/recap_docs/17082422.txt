        RECOMMENDED DECISION ON MOTION TO DISMISS INDICTMENT

       The indictment against the defendant, Ulysses Grant Queener, alleges unlawful

possession of an unregistered firearm made from a single-shot, .410- gauge shotgun and having a

barrel length of less than 18 inches and an overall length of less than 26 inches, in violation of

the National Firearms Act, 26 U.S.C. §§ 5861(d), 5871. Mr. Queener asserts that it is

"downright irrational" and, therefore, in violation of his right to due process of law, for the

Government to charge him with a crime and seek criminal sanctions against him because his

shotgun is no more dangerous than any of a variety of .410-guage pistols with even shorter

barrels and with multiple-round chambers, none of which are required to be registered in the

National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record. (Mot. to Dismiss Indictment at 1, Docket

No. 38, quoting Hudson v. United States, 522 U.S. 93, 103 (1997).) I recommend that the Court

deny the motion.

       For purposes of the § 5861(d) charge, "firearm" is defined to include "(1) a shotgun

having a barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length [and] (2) a weapon made from a

shotgun if such weapon as modified has an overall length of less than 26 inches or a barrel or

barrels of less than 18 inches in length." 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a). As the Government sets forth at

length in its opposition brief (and as Queener implicitly acknowledges with his characterization

of the indictment as irrational), the registration requirement for certain firearms need only serve a

rational purpose to be consistent with due process precepts. (Gov't's Resp. Mem. at 2-4,

collecting cases). As asserted by the Government (Gov't's Resp. Mem. at 5-6), the fact that a

shotgun barrel has been intentionally shortened is a legitimate cause of congressional concern

and supports singling out such weapons for registration under the Act as inherently dangerous

weapons. See United States v. Fortes, 133 F.3d 157, 161 (1st Cir. 1998) (explaining that "only

those firearms must be registered that Congress has found to be inherently dangerous and

generally lacking usefulness, except for violent and criminal purposes, such as sawed-off

shotguns and hand-grenades"); United States v. Serna, 309 F.3d 859, 863 (5th 2002) ("Congress

passed the NFA in response to gangster-style violence after observing tha t 'there is no reason

why anyone except a law officer should have a machine gun or a sawed-off shotgun.'") (quoting

H.Rep. No. 1780, at 1 (1934) and collecting consistent opinions from the Courts of Appeals for

the Fourth, Seventh and Ninth Circuits); see also United States v. Allegree, 175 F.3d 648, 651

(8th Cir. 1999) (finding that sawed-off shotguns "are inherently dangerous and lack usefulness

except for violent and criminal purposes"). 1 In sum, the fact that Queener could lawfully possess

an unregistered handgun having a destructive capacity equal to or greater than his single-shot

.410 shotgun is without constitutional significance. What makes his shotgun subject to

heightened regulation is the fact that it has been altered in a manner that is suggestive of criminal

          According to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, insofar as firearm registration advances
Congress's power to lay and collect taxes imposed, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 5811, upon the transfer of firearms,
"Congress legitimately may target for punishment the recipient of an unregistered firearm as a means of
discouraging the circumvention of the transfer tax," including by means of imposing criminal consequences. United
States v. Lim, 444 F.3d 910, 914 (7th Cir. 2006) (panel op.). In the view of the Lim panel, at least, Congress's
power to lay and collect taxes provides a rational basis for requiring registration of those firearms subject to the
transfer tax imposed under § 5811 as well as the imposition of criminal sanctions for failing to register such firearms
to avoid a $200 tax.

intent. Congress has not banned all ownership of such weapons, but has merely concluded, on

grounds that are not irrational, that persons possessing such weapons must register them.

                                            Conclusion

       For the reasons set forth above, I RECOMMEND that the Court DENY the defendant's

motion to dismiss the indictment (Docket No. 38).
