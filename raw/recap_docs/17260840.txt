               ORDER ON THIRD MOTION TO DISMISS INDICTMENT

       On March 28, 2008, Russell E. Booker moved to dismiss the indictment asserting that the

statute under which he has been indicted, 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9), violates the Second

Amendment. Mot. to Dismiss Indictment as the Statute Charged was Enacted in Violation of the

United States Constitution (Docket # 36) (Def.’s Mot.). The Government replied on April 18,

2008, and on the same day, moved to strike the Defendant’s motion. Resp. of the United States

to Def.’s Third Mot. to Dismiss Indictment (Docket # 41) (Govt’s Resp.); Mot. to Strike (Docket

# 39). The Court denies both motions.

       Mr. Booker claims that “the Indictment charges a crime pursuant [to] a statute which was

enacted in contravention of the protections encompassed in the Second Amendment to the

United States Constitution.” Def.’s Mot. at 1. He recognizes that every circuit, save one, “has

held that the Second Amendment only secures a collective, rather than individual, right.” Id. at

2-3 (citing United States v. Emerson, 270 F.3d 203 (5th Cir. 2001) as conferring an individual

right). However, Mr. Booker points to the Supreme Court’s recent granting certiorari and

hearing of arguments concerning the Second Amendment. Id. at 4 (citing District of Columbia v.

Heller, 128 S. Ct. 645 (2007)). In Heller, the question before the Supreme Court is whether two

District of Columbia statutes “violate the Second Amendment rights of individuals who are not

affiliated with any state-regulated militia, but who wish to keep handguns and other firearms for

private use in their homes?” Heller, 128 S. Ct. at 645. Thus, Mr. Booker states, “in order to

preserve whatever rights may soon be recognized, Mr. Booker submits the instant motion to

dismiss.” Def.’s Mot. at 5.

       The Government responds by attacking the grounds underlying Mr. Booker’s argument

that an individual right is protected by the Second Amendment. Govt’s Resp. at 1-2. The

Government cites several cases, including United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 178 (1939), as

evidence that “the Second Amendment only confers a collective right of keeping and bearing

arms which must bear a reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well

regulated militia.” Id. at 3 (quoting United States v. Johnson, 497 F.3d 548, 550 (4th Cir. 1974))

(quotation marks omitted); see also Gardner v. Vespia, 252 F.3d 500, 503 (1st Cir. 2001); United

States v. Milheron, 231 F. Supp. 2d 376, 378 (D. Me. 2002) (“In keeping with the majority trend,

the First Circuit has held that the right to keep and bear arms is not generally conferred upon the

people, but instead protects only the right to possess weapons with a reasonable relationship to

the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.”) (citing Cases v. United States, 131

F.2d 916, 921-23 (1st Cir. 1942) and Thomas v. Members of City Council, 730 F.2d 41, 42 (1st

Cir. 1984) (per curiam)).

       This Court is bound by stare decisis, and unless alternative binding authority is

presented, the Court owes allegiance to existing precedent. Eulitt v. Maine, 386 F.3d 344, 349

(1st Cir. 2004) (“Until a court of appeals revokes a binding precedent, a district court within the

circuit is hard put to ignore that precedent unless it has unmistakably been cast into disrepute by

supervening authority.”). The “special justification” for a district court to depart from First

Circuit authority is not present here. Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U.S. 203, 212 (1984); Gately v.

Massachusetts, 2 F.3d 1221, 1226 (1st Cir. 1993). Mr. Booker’s position rests on his hope that

Second Amendment jurisprudence will change, but not the necessary authority that it has.

         Finally, the Government moves to strike Mr. Booker’s motion because it was filed out of

time, and “[t]he defendant has not asserted good cause for his failure to comply with the deadline

set by the Court’s order.” Mot. to Strike at 1. On May 15, 2008, the Court granted Mr. Booker’s

motion to file a motion out of time; therefore, the motion to strike is moot.1 Minute Entry

(Docket # 46).

         The Court DENIES Mr. Booker’s motion to dismiss (Docket # 36), and also DENIES the

Government’s motion to strike the motion to dismiss (Docket # 39)).

         SO ORDERED.

Dated this 6th day of June, 2008




1
  In his motion to file his Motion to Dismiss out of time, Mr. Booker cited the Heller oral arguments, which took
place on March 18, 2008, as a “light . . . in the abyss” for asserting a Second Amendment individual right. Mot. to
File Pretrial Mot. Out of Time (Docket # 35). The Government responds that Mr. Booker should not be permitted to
rely on oral arguments as the catalyst for his motion, and that there is no reason to believe that the Supreme Court’s
Heller decision will change an analysis of § 922. Mot. to Strike at 1-2. Be that as it may, the Court has permitted
Mr. Booker’s filing out of time, and his argument is now preserved.
