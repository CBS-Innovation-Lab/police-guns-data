         MOTION TO CONTINUE PLEA AND SENTENCING HEARING

     Defendant, Michael Fowler, moves that this Court continue

his plea and sentencing hearing, presently scheduled for February

20, 2008, to February 29, 2008 or as soon thereafter as is

convenient to the Court.     The instant matter is a companion

matter to the prosecution in United States v. Michael Fowler,

Criminal No. 04-10308-JLT.     Defendant has pled guilty before

Judge Tauro and has been sentenced to 120 months imprisonment.

By plea agreement, the instant matter is considered relevant

conduct to the matter before Judge Tauro and the government will

recommend a concurrent sentence before this Court.            Although the

plea and sentencing are uncontroversial, counsel requires time to

meet with defendant prior to the proceedings.          Moreover, the

sentencing will require adjustments pursuant to U.S.S.C. §5G1.3,

a subject about which defendant intends to submit a short

memorandum.

     Counsel for defendant is lead counsel in United States v.

Carol Aranjo, et al., Criminal No. 06-30014-MAP, and is presently

in the midst of what is expected to be a six-week trial before
    Case 1:05-cr-10145-NG   Document 16   Filed 02/18/2008   Page 2 of 3



Judge Ponsor in that matter in Springfield.        The complexity of

the trial has thus far required counsel’s full attention during

trial days and thus counsel has been unable to draft and file a

sentencing memorandum in the instant matter.         Moreover, the trial

schedule will prevent counsel from arriving at the Boston

courthouse for the presently scheduled hearing time of 2:30 p.m.

on February 20.

     Defendant therefore requests that the Court continue the

plea and sentencing hearing to February 29, 2008, a day Judge

Ponsor has scheduled as a break in the Aranjo trial.

Alternatively, defendant requests that the Court continue the

matter to a date   thereafter convenient to the Court, but, if

before March 14, 2008 (the conclusion of the Aranjo trial) to a

time later in the afternoon to allow counsel to return from

Springfield and meet with defendant prior to the hearing.

     The holiday and associated time constraints prevented

counsel from obtaining the assent of the government.           Defendant

submits that all time up to an including the rescheduled plea and

sentencing hearing should be excluded from operation of the

Speedy Trial Act in the interests of justice.
