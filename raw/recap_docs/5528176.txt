           Re:     United States of America v. Jerome Penrose
                   Cr. No. 05-CR-10094

   Dear Judge Lindsay:

            As a supplement to the Mr. Penrose's Sentencing Memorandum and Request For
   Downward Departure, please review Ms. Muise's letter which is attached. Ms. Muise will be
   unable to attend the sentencing hearing on Monday. She, however, wanted to inform the Court of
   her relationship with Mr. Penrose and his relationship with her children. Please consider this
   letter along with Mr. Penroseâ€™s Sentencing Memorandum.

           Thank you.

                                                           Very truly yours,



                                                           /s/ Jessica C. Lowney
