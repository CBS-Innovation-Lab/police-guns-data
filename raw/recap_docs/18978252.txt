                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                        DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                                   Criminal No. 11-cr-079-01-SM

Angel A. Oller



                    ORDER OF DETENTION PENDING TRIAL

     In accordance with 18 U.S.C. ยง 3142(f), a hearing was conducted

on June 8, 2011, for the purpose of determining whether to detain

the defendant.     The court issued its detention order orally from the

bench.    This written order summarizes the court's findings and

rulings.


                              Legal Standards

     Section 3142(f) of the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. '' 3141-3156,

"does not authorize a detention hearing whenever the government

thinks detention would be desirable, but rather limits such hearings"

to the circumstances listed in 18 U.S.C. '' 3142(f)(1) and (f)(2).

United States v. Ploof, 851 F.2d 7, 10 (1st Cir. 1988).        In this case,

the government invokes ' 3142(f)(1)(c), asserting that a detention

hearing is warranted because the defendant is charged with a drug

offense that carries maximum sentence of ten or more years.
       Case 1:11-cr-00079-SM Document 7 Filed 06/09/11 Page 2 of 7




     In this case, the defendant is charged by indictment with:

           one count of Possession of a Firearm by a Convicted Felon

           in violation of 18 U.S.C. ' 922(g)(1);

           one count of Distribution of Heroin in violation of 21

           U.S.C. ' 841(a)(1);

           one count of Possession of a Firearm in Furtherance of a

           Drug Trafficking Crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. ' 924(c);

           and

           one count of Aiding and Abetting the Making of a False

           Statement During the Acquisition of a Firearm in

           violation of 18 U.S.C. '' 2 and 922(a)(6).

The distribution of heroin charge satisfies the parameters of '

3142(f)(1)(c), and, accordingly, the detention hearing was

appropriately requested.

     Pursuant to ' 3142(f), the court must determine whether any

condition or combination of conditions set forth in subsection (c)

will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant ("risk of

flight") and the safety of any other person and the safety of the

community ("dangerousness") 18 U.S.C. ' 3142(f); United States v.

Patriarca, 948 F.2d 789, 791 (1st Cir. 1991).        In making this

determination, the court must consider the following: (1) the nature

and circumstances of the offense charged; (2) the weight of the




                                   2
       Case 1:11-cr-00079-SM Document 7 Filed 06/09/11 Page 3 of 7




evidence as to guilt; (3) the history and characteristics of the

accused, including family ties, past history, financial resources

and employment; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to

any person or the community that would be posed by a release.          18

U.S.C. ' 3142(g).

     During the course of a hearing conducted pursuant to 18 U.S.C.

' 3142, the government has the burden of persuading the court that

no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure (1)

the defendant's presence at trial, United States v. Perez-Franco,

839 F.2d 867, 870 (1st Cir. 1988); or (2) the safety of another or

the community.   Patriarca, 948 F.2d at 793.       For its part, the

government is required to prove risk of flight by a preponderance

of the evidence and to establish dangerousness by clear and

convincing evidence.     See id. at 792-93.

     In specific instances, delineated in 18 U.S.C. ' 3142(e), a

presumption arises that no condition or combination of conditions

will reasonably assure the appearance of a defendant and the safety

of the community.   Among the instances where a presumption arises

is the situation where

     the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause
     to believe that the person committed an offense for which
     a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is
     prescribed in the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C.
     801 et seq.) . . . .




                                   3
         Case 1:11-cr-00079-SM Document 7 Filed 06/09/11 Page 4 of 7




18 U.S.C. ' 3142(e)(3)(A).      Once the presumption is invoked, the

defendant need only produce "some evidence" to rebut it.               United

States v. Dillon, 938 F.2d 1412, 1416 (1st Cir. 1991); United States

v. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 384 (1st Cir. 1985).          "When a defendant

produces such evidence, however, the presumption does not disappear.

The burden of persuasion remains on the government and the rebutted

presumption retains evidentiary weight."        Dillon, 938 F.2d at 1416.


                          Findings and Rulings

     In the instant case, the indictment provides probable cause to

believe that the offenses charged have been committed and that the

defendant has committed them.       Further, the drug charge is one for

which a maximum term of imprisonment is ten years or more, as

prescribed in the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. '' 801 et seq.

Thus, ' 3142(e)'s rebuttable presumption that "no condition or

combination of conditions will reasonably assure [the defendant's]

appearance . . . and the safety of the community" is triggered in

this case.    See 18 U.S.C. ' 3142(e), (f); 21 U.S.C. ' 841(b)(1)(C);

see also United States v. Vargas, 804 F.2d 157, 162-63 (1st Cir.

1986).   Defendant has also been charged with possession of a firearm

by a convicted felon and possession of a firearm in furtherance of

a drug trafficking crime.       Thus, ' 3142(f)(1)(E)'s rebuttable

presumption that "no condition or combination of conditions will




                                     4
          Case 1:11-cr-00079-SM Document 7 Filed 06/09/11 Page 5 of 7




reasonably assure the safety of any other person and the community"

is also triggered in this case.

     The government sought detention on the basis of both flight and

danger.    For the reasons stated on the record, the court determined

that conditions could be fashioned to reasonably assure the

defendant's appearance.       However, for reasons stated below and on

the record, and after considering the proffers of counsel and the

factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. ' 3142(g), the court finds that the

defendant's release, even on strict conditions, presents an

unacceptable risk of danger to the community.

     Specifically, with respect to dangerousness, the court weighed

the following:

            The nature of the charges are extremely serious.            They

            include the sale of a controlled drug, possession of a

            firearm by a convicted felon, and possessing a firearm in

            furtherance of drug trafficking.         The government

            discovered defendant's criminal activity after tracing

            back to the defendant a firearm used in a Boston homicide

            in March 2010.     According to the government, the gun

            traveled from the defendant to a relative of the defendant,

            who then provided the gun to the person who committed the

            murder with it.

          The weight of the evidence against the defendant is very

          strong and includes recorded phone calls during which the

          defendant allegedly made incriminating admissions.

          A search warrant executed at the defendant's residence

          resulted in the discovery of approximately 50 grams of

          cocaine.

          Defendant has a criminal record that, while old, includes

          convictions on two counts of assault and battery with a

          dangerous weapon.

          Defendant is currently released on bail ($25,000 cash) for

          related drug charges pending in Suffolk County Superior

          Court in Suffolk County, Massachusetts.         Despite being

          released on bail, defendant admits that he has continued

          to smoke marijuana on a daily basis.       Defendant told the

          pretrial services officer during his interview that he was

          "unaware that he was not allowed to smoke marijuana while

          on bail."

On the basis of the foregoing, the court concludes that the defendant

is a danger to the community.

     For all of these reasons, the court finds that the government,

aided by the presumption, has met its burden to prove that no

condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the

safety of the community.     Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the

defendant be detained pending trial.

      The defendant is committed to the custody of the Attorney

General or his designated representative for confinement in a

corrections facility, to be held separately, to the extent

practicable, from persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held

in custody pending appeal.      The defendant shall be afforded a

reasonable opportunity for private consultation with defense

counsel.   On order of a court of the United States or on request of

an attorney for the government, the person in charge of the

corrections facility shall deliver the defendant to the United States

Marshal for the purpose of appearing in connection with court

proceedings.

      SO ORDERED.
