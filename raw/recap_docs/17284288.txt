                          MEMORANDUM & ORDER

GORTON, J.

     In this criminal case the defendant, Moises Cintron

(“Cintron”), is charged with one count of being a felon in

possession of a firearm and ammunition.       He has moved to dismiss

the Indictment pending against him pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 5

because he was not arraigned until the day after his arrest.           The

motion is without merit and will be denied

I.   Factual Background

     Cintron was arrested on the morning of November 5, 2008,

during the course of a vehicle stop on Route 128 in Massachusetts

after police observed a gun protruding from his pocket.          The

facts surrounding that vehicle stop are recounted in detail in

this Court’s December 15, 2008, Memorandum and Order (Docket No.

23), which denied most aspects of Cintron’s motion to suppress.

     Cintron’s arrest occurred sometime after 10:00 AM and he was

subsequently taken to the Massachusetts State Police barracks in

                                  -1-

Danvers, Massachusetts.     Following the arrest state officials

called Special Agent Michael Turner (“Turner”) of the Bureau of

Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (“the ATF”) at

approximately 11:00 AM.     At an evidentiary hearing on the

defendant’s motion to suppress, Turner testified that after

receiving that call he traveled to the Danvers barracks with the

intention of interviewing Cintron.       Turner arrived at the

barracks at approximately 1:45 PM but the interview did not

commence until approximately 4:00 PM.        Finally, Cintron was

arraigned on the following day, November 6, 2007.

II.   Procedural History

      Cintron was indicted on December 19, 2007.        He filed a

motion to suppress on July 17, 2008, which, after an evidentiary

hearing and several memoranda and orders, was finally denied in

its entirety on April 1, 2009.

      At a status conference held on April 30, 2009, the Court

scheduled trial in this case for June 29, 2009.         At that same

status conference the defendant requested the Court’s permission

to file a motion to dismiss based on the failure to arraign

Cintron on the day of his arrest.        Although expressing skepticism

about the merits of such a motion, the Court permitted its filing

on or before May 7, 2009, and granted the government one week to

respond.   Cintron filed the pending motion to dismiss on May 8,

2009, and the government has since filed its opposition.

III. Analysis

     Cintron asserts that the Indictment must be dismissed

because his arrest and arraignment did not comply with the

requirements of Fed. R. Crim. P. 5.      That rule states, in

pertinent part:

     A person making an arrest within the United States must
     take the defendant without unnecessary delay before a
     magistrate judge, or before a state or local judicial
     officer as Rule 5(c) provides, unless a statute
     provides otherwise.

Fed. R. Crim. P. 5(a)(1)(A).     As the defendant recognizes, that

rule ordinarily does not apply to persons in state custody.           See,

e.g., United States v. Rivas-Lopez, 988 F. Supp. 1424, 1428 (D.

Utah 1997) (“Rule 5(a) attaches only after the accused is taken

into federal custody.” (citation omitted)).        Although that would

seem to end the inquiry, the defendant argues that Rule 5(a) can

apply to a defendant in state custody where there is evidence of

a “working arrangement” between federal and local law enforcement

rendering the custody federal in substance.        See United States v.

Mayes, 552 F.2d 729, 734 (6th Cir. 1977); Carpenter v. United

States, 264 F.2d 565, 571 (4th Cir. 1959).

     Although there may be circumstances in which the involvement

of federal officials in the detention of a suspect in state

custody is so pervasive as to warrant the conclusion that the

custody was federal in substance, this case does not present that

scenario.   The mere fact that Special Agent Turner was called and


                                  -3-

decided to interview Cintron does not convert the defendant’s

custody from state to federal.     There is no evidence to suggest

that Turner, or any other federal official, delayed Cintron’s

arraignment or exercised any authority or control over Cintron’s

detention.    Consequently, the defendant’s motion to dismiss will

be denied.



                                 ORDER

     In accordance with the foregoing, the defendant’s motion to

dismiss (Docket No. 42) is DENIED.



So ordered.
