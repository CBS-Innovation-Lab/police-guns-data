           ORDER ON MOTION FOR RELEASE PENDING APPEAL

      A defendant serving a one hundred eighty-month term of incarceration for

possession of a firearm by a prohibited person in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1)

moves for release pending appeal. The Court concludes that although the defendant

has met his burden to show that he is not a danger or flight risk and that his appeal

is not for purposes of delay, he failed to demonstrate the appeal presents a substantial

question of law or fact sufficient to warrant his release and similarly failed to

demonstrate exceptional reasons to justify his release. Accordingly, the Court denies

the motion because the defendant fails to meet the statutory conditions for release

pending appeal.

I.    BACKGROUND

      On November 16, 2020, the Court sentenced Jonathan Bowers to one hundred

eighty months imprisonment, two years of supervised release, and a $100.00 special

assessment. Min. Entry (ECF No. 118). The Court imposed this sentence following

Mr. Bowers’ September 14, 2017 guilty plea to one count of possession of a firearm by

a prohibited person in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). Min. Entry (ECF No. 56); J.

at 2 (ECF No. 120). As the Court explained to Mr. Bowers and the Government at
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 2 of 35                   PageID #: 590




sentencing, it would not have imposed this sentence but for the statutory mandatory

minimum.

       Despite reservations about the length of the sentence, the Court resolved that

it was required to impose the one-hundred-and-eighty-month sentence because the

statute mandated it. The Court concluded that Mr. Bowers had more than three prior

convictions for a violent felony and fit within the definition of armed career criminal

under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.4(b)(3)(B) and 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1) (ACCA). Findings Affecting

Sentencing ¶ 3 (ECF No. 121); Suppl. Order on Sentencing Issues and Order on Mot.

for Video Hearing at 13-17 (ECF No. 109) (Second Sentencing Order); Order on

Sentencing Issues at 12 (ECF No. 91) (First Sentencing Order). Mr. Bowers’ Guideline

range for imprisonment was one hundred sixty-eight to two hundred ten months

because he had a Total Offense Level of thirty and a Criminal History Category VI.

Findings Affecting Sentencing ¶ 8. However, as an armed career criminal, the statute

triggered a mandatory minimum sentence of one hundred eighty months under 18

U.S.C. § 924(e)(1). Id. The armed career criminal designation also affected Mr.

Bowers’ guideline sentence range, increasing his base offense level to 33, which was

reduced to 30 because of his acceptance of responsibility, and his criminal history

category, which would have been III, was increased to VI, resulting in a guideline

sentence range of 180 to 210 months. 1




1       The Court found that Mr. Bowers’ guideline sentence range was 168 to 210 months; however,
as the statutory mandatory minimum trumped the guideline range, the resulting guideline range was
180 to 210 months. Findings Affecting Sentencing ¶ 8.

       Without the ACCA and U.S.S.G. § 4B1.4, Mr. Bowers would have had a Total

Offense Level of nineteen and a Criminal History Category III. First Sentencing

Order at 26. The applicable guideline range would have been thirty-seven to forty-

six months, a fine between $10,000 and $100,000, and a period of supervised release

between one and three years. Id.

       On November 17, 2020, Mr. Bowers appealed his sentence to the Court of

Appeals for the First Circuit. Notice of Appeal (ECF No. 122). Two days later, he

moved for release pending appeal. Mot. for Release Pending Appeal (ECF No. 126)

(Def.’s Mot.).   On December 10, 2020, the Government responded in opposition.

Bowers supplemented his filings with relevant medical records. Winthrop Family

Medicine Records (ECF No. 134) (Med. Records).

II.    THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

       A.     Jonathan Bowers’ Motion

       Mr. Bowers contends that he qualifies for release pending appeal pursuant to

18 U.S.C. § 3143 and United States v. Bayko, 774 F.2d 516, 522 (1st Cir. 1985). Def.’s

Mot. at 2. He states that to qualify for release pending appeal a defendant must show

“(1) he is not a flight risk or danger to public safety; (2) the appeal is not for purposes

of delay; and (3) the appeal ‘raises a substantial question of law or fact likely to result




                                            3
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 4 of 35            PageID #: 592




in [a] reversal [or] an order for a new trial.’” Id. (alteration in original) (quoting 18

U.S.C. § 3143(b)(1)(B)(i)-(ii); Bayko, 774 F.2d at 522).

      First, Mr. Bowers asserts that he “is not a flight risk or danger to public safety.”

Id. He notes that he “was monitored by Pretrial Services for nearly 1 year until he

appeared and pled on September 14, 2017” and during that time he “was monitored

without any issues beyond taking one single trip out of state without permission” for

which he “admitted wrong-doing and addressed this issue with Pretrial Services.” Id.

He further states that he has completed programs since entering custody. Id. He

also cites his health as weighing against finding he is a flight risk or dangerous. Id.

Mr. Bowers reminds the Court that he suffered a traumatic brain injury during the

event which led to his conviction, and now walks with a cane for support. Id. He also

argues that his “limited financial resources,” as documented in the Presentence

Investigation Report (PSR), and his willingness to surrender any passport “alleviates

any concerns that he is a flight risk.” Id. at 3.

      Second, Mr. Bowers argues that his “appeal is not imposed for purposes of

delay.” Id. He states that he “has pursued his appeal rights regarding ACCA since

nearly the inception of the charges against him.” Id. Moreover, he states that the

appeal presents an issue that the First Circuit has previously “discussed, but not

decided” in Bender v. United States, No. 16-2602, J. at 2 (1st Cir. Jan. 28, 2020) and

is therefore not an attempt to delay his incarceration. Id.

      Third, Mr. Bowers asserts that his “appeal raises a substantial question of law

or fact likely to result in reversal.” Id. He acknowledges that Bayko, 774 F.2d 516,



                                            4
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 5 of 35             PageID #: 593




provides the relevant test and “requires a finding that the appeal presents a close

question or one that very well could be decided the other way.” Id. (internal quotation

marks omitted) (citing Bayko, 774 F.2d at 523). According to Mr. Bowers, “[t]his is a

more rigorous standard than ‘fairly debatable,’ but less strict than one requiring the

defendant to show that it ‘is more likely than not’ that the conviction would be

reversed on appeal.” Id.

      Mr. Bowers frames the question presented by his appeal as being the same

presented to, but not decided by, the First Circuit in Bender. Id. at 4. In contrast to

Bender, Mr. Bowers asserts that he has “preserved his appeal rights on those

grounds.” Id. The crux of his argument is that Maine’s burglary statute does not fit

the definition of a generic burglary because Maine burglary extends to structures

which, as defined by statute, “include[es] ‘other place[s] designed to provide

protection . . . for property.’” Id. (quoting 17-A M.R.S. § 2(24)).

      To reach this conclusion, Mr. Bowers ties together several recent cases from

the United States Supreme Court and First Circuit. He first notes that in United

States v. Farrell, 672 F.3d 27, 30 (1st Cir. 2012), the First Circuit concluded that state

burglary statutes which apply to places other than buildings, such as automobiles or

vending machines, are not generic and therefore do not trigger the ACCA’s

enumerated offense enhancement. Id. at 4. Then, he observes that Maine’s burglary

statute extends to structures, which are “other place[s] designed to provide

protection . . . for property.” Id. (quoting 17-A M.R.S. § 2(24)). Mr. Bowers then

contends that his own conviction shows Maine burglary is not generic because he was



                                            5
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 6 of 35             PageID #: 594




convicted for burglarizing “mobile storage trailers that were meant to protect

property of a marina and cell phone business.” Id.

      Mr. Bowers acknowledges the 2018 Supreme Court case of United States v.

Stitt, 139 S. Ct. 399 (2018) determined “the definition [of generic burglary] to include

mobile conveyances adapted for overnight accommodations.” Id. Even so, he claims

Stitt does not foreclose his argument. Id. He maintains that “burglary in Maine is

broader than structure under the generic definition” even after Stitt, and in spite of

the First Circuit’s decision that Maine burglary is generic in United States v.

Duquette, 778 F.3d 314 (1st Cir. 2015). Id. In support, he argues the late-Judge

Torruella’s dissent in Dimott v. United States, 881 F.3d 232, 246 (1st Cir. 2018) makes

it such that Duquette “is plainly open to reconsideration by the First Circuit . . ..” Id.

Thus, he concludes that the doctrinal tension presented by Farrell and Judge

Torruella’s dissent in Dimott “make[] it very well the case that application of ACCA

could—[and] for that matter should—be decided differently than it was decided in

this Court’s opinion, which is bound by the precedent in Duquette.” Id. at 5.

      As a final argument for release pending appeal, Mr. Bowers pivots to 18 U.S.C.

§ 3145(c), which he contends “entitle[s] [him] to release . . . on a showing of exceptional

circumstances.” Id. He writes that he “is currently incarcerated at Cumberland

County Jail . . . but will be transferred to a BOP facility,” where he may contract

COVID-19. Id. at 6. He then discusses his asthma diagnosis and cites CDC guidance

for the proposition that it may increase his risk of severe complications from COVID-

19. Id. He also cites his need to walk with a cane, “which limits his mobility and



                                            6
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 7 of 35           PageID #: 595




ability to socially distance—to the extent that is even possible in a correctional

setting.” Id.

      In addition, Mr. Bowers notes that the time he has served exceeds his non-

ACCA Guideline range. Id. He submits that before the COVID-19 pandemic began,

he continued his sentencing “for purposes of awaiting the outcome of appeals before

the US Supreme Court and the First Circuit Court of Appeals.” Id. After those

appeals were resolved, his sentencing was set to occur on April 28, 2020. Id. He

observes his “sentencing never happened in April . . . due to the inability of the Court

to hold in-person proceedings” and that “[i]t would be difficult to describe the

circumstances in our courts and our country since March of 2020 as anything other

than exceptional.” Id. He states that if he “had been sentenced in April, then he

would have immediately filed an appeal and begun that process before he was already

serving a sentence in excess of his non-ACCA guidelines.” Id.

      B.        The Government’s Opposition

      The Government opposes Mr. Bowers’ motion, stating that he “has failed to

meet his burden on any of the elements required for his requested relief.” Gov’t’s

Opp’n at 1. First, the Government argues that “[Mr.] Bowers is a danger to the

community and a flight risk.”      Id. at 3.   In support, the Government points to

Mr. Bowers’ criminal history which includes “an escalating series of burglaries

commencing at age 18 and continuing through age 22” as well as other offenses. Id.

The Government also discusses Mr. Bowers’ offense of conviction, in which he

“arm[ed] himself in fear of his quasi-employer” but “proceeded to go there and engage



                                           7
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 8 of 35           PageID #: 596




in an extended altercation with the employer during which . . . Mr. Bowers touched

the gun at his hip more than once.” Id. (internal citations omitted). The Government

continues, writing that “the Court has determined that there was not a

preponderance of evidence showing Mr. Bowers to be the primary aggressor . . .

[n]onetheless, it does not follow that Mr. Bowers meets his burden to show, by clear

and convincing evidence, that he is not a danger.” Id. at 4. Instead, the Government

argues that Mr. Bowers’ “criminal history, personal history of seeking out

altercations, and ultimate escalation to carrying a firearm are all of concern.” Id. In

addition, the Government cites Mr. Bowers’ unauthorized trip out of state while on

bail as suggesting he is a flight risk, and further writes that “[w]hile it is true that

Mr. Bowers only had one reported trip out of state, that fact does not prove a universe

of negatives.” Id. at 5.

      Second, the Government avers that Mr. Bowers’ appeal “does not raise a

substantial question of fact or law.” Id. The Government contends that Mr. Bowers’

reliance on Judge Torruella’s dissent in Dimott, and the majority opinion in Farrell,

is misplaced. Id. at 6. According to the Government, “[Mr.] Bowers’ citation to his

own case simply ignores the central holding of Mathis and Taylor, by attempting to

make a fact-based, rather than element-based, analysis of the underlying conviction.”

Id. The Government continues, writing that “Maine burglary is not divisible” and

therefore, “the Shepard documents have no application . . ..” Id. Moreover, the

Government states that even if Mr. Bowers could rely on such documents, they do not

support his claim because “the record shows only his agreement, while represented



                                           8
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 9 of 35           PageID #: 597




by counsel, that his conduct fit the elements of the offense.” Id. at 7. Accordingly,

the Government concludes that even if Mr. Bowers is correct that Maine burglary is

not generic because its definition of “structure” is too broad, Mr. Bowers lacks

sufficient evidence to show that his prior burglary convictions fell outside the generic

definition. Id. at 7.

       Regarding Bender, the Government characterizes Mr. Bowers’ reliance on the

case’s procedural posture as “misplaced.” Id. It states that “it would be more accurate

to say that these arguments were not addressed by the circuit court” and that “[t]he

First Circuit made no indication that Bender’s ‘alternative reasons’ had any merit or

were otherwise open questions in this Circuit.” Id. The Government also points out

Bender reaffirmed that Maine burglary convictions are “qualifying predicates under

the ACCA enumerated offense clause. Id.

       Shifting to Mr. Bowers’ argument that exceptional reasons justify release, the

Government argues that he fails to show such reasons. Id. at 8. Citing United States

v. Garcia, 340 F.3d 1013, 1019-21 (9th Cir. 2003) and United States v. Farlow, 824

F. Supp. 2d. 189, 196 (D. Me. 2011), the Government states that there is a “non-

exhaustive list of factors” for the Court to consider in undertaking this analysis. Id.

The Government contends that none of these factors supports releasing Mr. Bowers.

Id.

       The Government also disputes Mr. Bowers’ conclusion that the COVID-19

pandemic and his asthma present an exceptional reason for release pending appeal.

Id. at 10-11. The Government notes that the “circumstances are not exceptional”



                                           9
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 10 of 35            PageID #: 598




 because “this pandemic affects every federal prisoner, if not every American . . ..” Id.

 at 11. Moreover, the Government questions whether Mr. Bowers has asthma, stating

 that a “search of the revised PSR found only his wife’s unverified assertion” to support

 an asthma diagnosis. Id. Lastly, the Government contends that the BOP’s response

 to the COVID-19 pandemic can adequately protect him from the dangers presented

 by the virus. Id. at 11-15.

       C.     Jonathan Bowers’ Reply

       Mr. Bowers begins his reply by taking issue with the Government’s argument

 that he is a danger to the community. He asserts that “[t]he Government continues

 to argue the facts of what happened in April 2016 despite the findings of this Court

 after an evidentiary hearing where the Government’s alleged victim, Justin Taylor,

 testified and was deemed not credible.” Def.’s Reply at 1. Mr. Bowers then reiterates

 his belief that his prior burglary convictions “are not evidence that he is a danger to

 the public so many years later.” Id. He also notes that his trip out of state while on

 bail does not show he is a danger to the community because he “was not revoked for

 this trip and returned and reported the facts of it to his pretrial officer and the

 Government through his then attorney.” Id. at 2.

       As to whether he raised a substantial question of law, Mr. Bowers contends

 that, contrary to the Government’s assertion, he “has not even raised . . . a fact-based

 inquiry into the specific elements of his own convictions and vehicles adapted for

 overnight accommodations.” Id. Rather, he states that his argument on appeal is a

 point “that Duquette fails to address—because the parties did not raise—the portion



                                           10
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 11 of 35            PageID #: 599




 of the Maine statute relevant to [Mr. Bowers’] appeal . . ..” Id. He also argues that

 “Stitt is a red herring” because his burglaries did not involve “vehicles adapted for

 overnight accommodations.” Id. at 2-3.

       Regarding Stitt, Mr. Bowers contends that “[t]he First Circuit’s refusal to

 address Bender’s argument does not go on to state that even if his claims were not

 procedurally barred, then they would be denied under United States v. Stitt.” Id. at 3.

 Therefore, he maintains that stating Stitt foreclosed all arguments that Maine

 burglary is non-generic “places more weight on Stitt tha[n] it can bear.” Id. Mr.

 Bowers asserts that the First Circuit did not reach this conclusion in Bender and that

 “Stitt does not address 17-A M.R.S. § 2(24), which includes far more than vehicles

 adapted for overnight accommodations in its definition of structure.” Id.

       Mr. Bowers then again responds to the Government’s contention that he wants

 a fact-based inquiry, clarifying that he does not demand one. Id. Further, he “does

 not agree . . . that his Rule 11 plea colloquy merely proves his guilt for his predicate

 conviction . . . [i]nstead that plea colloquy proves that Maine trial courts . . .

 considered ‘structure’ to include mobile storage trailers for purposes of Maine’s

 burglary statute.” Id.

       Finally, Mr. Bowers grapples with the Government’s contention that he has

 not demonstrated exceptional reasons for his release. Id. at 3. He first notes that

 under Farlow, the First Circuit does not use a list of factors to determine whether

 exceptional reasons are present.      Id. at 3-4    Therefore, he contends that the

 Government’s reliance on Garcia is misplaced. Id. at 4. Mr. Bowers takes issue with



                                           11
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 12 of 35           PageID #: 600




 the Government’s application of the Garcia factors, noting that although the

 Government argues “[Mr.] Bowers’s status as an ACCA defendant makes him a

 dangerous recidivist . . . [t]he facts of Bowers[’] case and central reason for his

 appeal . . . tell a different story.” Id. He notes that all but one of his burglary

 convictions arose from burgling an unoccupied storage trailer or abandoned home,

 and all these convictions occurred between the ages of eighteen and twenty-two. Id.

       Mr. Bowers also rejects the Government’s argument that his life “was not, in

 many respects, exemplary” as “a value judgment made relative to some person who

 has not lived [Mr.] Bowers’s life.” Id. He notes that he had a difficult childhood,

 “including physical abuse and neglect, as well as sexual abuse . . ..” Id. He states

 that he “persevered through these childhood difficulties raising his two children

 successfully, volunteering his time at a local church, and helping members of his

 community who were in need.” Id.

       Mr. Bowers argues that he does, in fact, have asthma. Id. He states that the

 Government’s objection to the information about his asthma occurred “despite [the

 Government’s] failing to lodge any objection to that portion of the PSR when it was

 possible to do so.” Id. He states he intends to file medical records showing an asthma

 diagnosis once he received them. Id. at 4 n..4. Mr. Bowers filed these medical records,

 and they show an asthma diagnosis as of June 6, 2017. Med. Record at 2.

       Finally, Mr. Bowers contends that “the COVID-19 numbers within BOP’s

 facilities speak for themselves.” Id. at 5. He stresses that there is a difference

 between having policies and ensuring that they are implemented effectively and then



                                           12
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 13 of 35              PageID #: 601




 cites BOP data showing outbreaks at several correctional institutions across the

 United States. Id. He therefore concludes that “[a] real and extraordinary danger

 exists for every inmate held in jails and prisons across the country.” Id.

 III.   DISCUSSION

        The Court concludes Mr. Bowers does not satisfy the statutory requirements

 to be released during the pendency of his appeal. After explaining the relevant legal

 standard, the Court considers Mr. Bowers’ motion. The Court denies the motion

 because Mr. Bowers has failed to show (1) that his appeal presents a “substantial

 question of law or fact” likely to result in a reduced sentence of imprisonment and (2)

 that there are exceptional reasons why his detention would not be appropriate.

        A.     Statutory Provisions for Release Pending Appeal

        The statute most obviously directed to the release of a defendant pending

 appeal, 18 U.S.C. § 3143(b) is denominated, “Release or detention pending

 appeal by the defendant.” Subsection (b)(1) provides:

        (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the judicial officer shall order
            that a person who has been found guilty of an offense and sentenced
            to a term of imprisonment, and who has filed an appeal or a petition
            for a writ of certiorari, be detained, unless the judicial officer finds—

        (A) by clear and convincing evidence that the person is not likely to flee
            or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community
            if released under section 3142(b) or (c) of this title; and

        (B) that the appeal is not for the purpose of delay and raises a
            substantial question of law or fact likely to result in—

             (i) reversal,
             (ii) an order for a new trial,
             (iii) a sentence that does not include a term of imprisonment, or



                                             13
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 14 of 35            PageID #: 602




           (iv) a reduced sentence to a term of imprisonment less than the total
           of the time already served plus the expected duration of the appeal
           process.

           If the judicial officer makes such findings, such judicial officer shall
           order the release of the person in accordance with section 3142(b) or
           (c) of this title, except that in the circumstance described in
           subparagraph (B)(iv) of this paragraph, the judicial officer shall
           order the detention terminated at the expiration of the likely
           reduced sentence.

 Unfortunately for Mr. Bowers, this section does not apply to him on its face, because

 of its introductory phrase: “Except as provided in paragraph (2).”

       Paragraph 2 provides:

       (2) The judicial officer shall order that a person who has been found
           guilty of an offense in a case described in subparagraph (A), (B), or
           (C) of subsection (f)(1) of section 3142 and sentenced to a term of
           imprisonment, and who has filed an appeal or a petition for a writ of
           certiorari, be detained.

 18 U.S.C. § 3143(b)(2). Subsection (f)(1) lists several categories of crimes, including

 “an offense for which the maximum sentence is life imprisonment or death.” 18

 U.S.C. § 3142(f)(1)(B). For a defendant subject to the ACCA, the possession of a

 firearm by a prohibited person has a potential maximum penalty of life

 imprisonment. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1), 924(e)(1); PSR ¶ 62. This means that

 under subsection 2, the Court may not release Mr. Bower pending appeal regardless

 whether he meets the criteria in § 3143(b)(1).

       But federal law is rarely so simple. Another provision, 18 U.S.C. § 3145(c),

 could allow Mr. Bowers’ release despite the prohibition of § 3143(b)(2). Section

 3145(c) reads:




                                           14
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 15 of 35             PageID #: 603




       (c) Appeal from a release or detention order. An appeal from a
       release or detention order, or from a decision denying revocation or
       amendment of such an order, is governed by the provisions of section
       1291 of title 28 and section 3731 of this title. The appeal shall be
       determined promptly. A person subject to detention pursuant to section
       3143(a) (2) or (b) (2), and who meets the conditions of release set forth
       in section 3143(a) (1) or (b) (1), may be ordered released, under
       appropriate conditions, by the judicial officer, if it is clearly shown that
       there are exceptional reasons why such person’s detention would not be
       appropriate.

 This statute expressly addresses persons, like Mr. Bowers, who are “subject to

 mandatory detention under 18 U.S.C. § 3143(b)(2).” See United States v. Weiner, No.

 92-1708, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 28794, at *2 (1st Cir. Jul. 31, 1992) (unpublished).

       This subsection revives the criteria in 18 U.S.C. § 3143(b)(1) and allows the

 Court to release him if he meets all the conditions of release in § 3142(b)(1) and also

 “clearly show[s] that there are exceptional reasons why such person’s detention would

 not be appropriate.” Excluded under § 3143(b)(2), the criteria in § 3143(b)(1) become

 relevant considerations under § 3145(c). The Court therefore turns to whether Mr.

 Bowers meets the criteria for release pending appeal under § 3142(b)(1).

       To summarize, Mr. Bowers needs first to show three things to justify his

 release pending appeal: (1) he is not likely to flee and he is not likely to pose a danger

 to the safety of any other person or the community; (2) his appeal is not for the

 purpose of delay; and (3) that the appeal raises a substantial question of law or fact

 likely to result in a reversal, new trial, non-incarcerative sentence, or a sentence of

 incarceration shorter than he has already served. United States v. Farlow, 824

 F. Supp. 2d 189, 193 (D. Me. 2011).         These three factors are the § 3143(b)(1)

 requirements. 18 U.S.C. § 3143(b)(1). If Mr. Bowers satisfies these three elements,

                                            15
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 16 of 35          PageID #: 604




 he must then clear the added hurdle of § 3145(c), which permits his release pending

 appeal upon a clear showing of “exceptional reasons.” 18 U.S.C. § 3145(c). See United

 States v. O’Neal, No. 1:18-cr-00020-JDL, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75291, at *2 (D. Me.

 Apr. 29, 2020) (describing the analysis as a four-factor inquiry). The burden to

 demonstrate release is proper rests with Mr. Bowers. United States v. Bayko, 774

 F.2d 516, 520 (1st Cir. 1985).

       The Court reviewed the parties’ submissions, the record, and the relevant

 caselaw and concludes it Mr. Bowers has not demonstrated that he fits within the

 statutory requirements for release while his appeal is pending. The Court concludes

 that Mr. Bowers has met his burden on the first two elements but failed to show his

 appeal presents a substantial question or that exceptional reasons merit his release.

       At Mr. Bowers’ sentencing, the Court explained that because he had at least

 three prior convictions for burglary under Maine law, the Court concluded that it had

 no choice but to sentence him to at least one hundred eighty months—fifteen years—

 in prison for possessing a firearm. However, the Court also expressed its belief, that

 if the 180-month sentence were not mandatory, the Court would not have imposed

 such a lengthy sentence, given its assessment of Mr. Bowers’ history and

 characteristics, the nature and circumstances of his offense, and the other sentencing

 factors under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). Put another way, if the First Circuit determines

 that the fifteen-year mandatory minimum does not apply to Mr. Bowers’ crime and

 remands Mr. Bowers’ case back to this Court for resentencing, the Court will without

 hesitation resentence him to a substantially lower sentence.



                                          16
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 17 of 35            PageID #: 605




       Unfortunately for Mr. Bowers, the Court’s comments at his sentencing hearing

 do not mean that he has raised a substantial question on appeal or that his case fits

 within the exception that allows a sentencing court to release a defendant pending

 appeal. The Court turns to those issues.

       B.     Risk of Flight and Danger to the Community

       Turning first to whether Mr. Bowers presents a risk of flight or “danger to the

 safety of any other person in the community,” the Court concludes he does not. In its

 opposition to his release, the Government reiterates its skeptical view of Mr. Bowers,

 the same arguments the AUSA pressed at Mr. Bowers’ sentencing hearing. Gov’t’s

 Opp’n at 3-5. The Court takes a markedly different view of Mr. Bowers and it

 expressed its view at the sentencing hearing as well. In the Court’s view, Mr. Bowers

 represents neither a risk of flight nor a danger to the community and would qualify

 for release pending appeal if he met the other statutory criteria.

       To explain, the Court acknowledges that the Government properly pointed to

 Mr. Bowers’ one unauthorized trip out of state while on bail before his guilty plea as

 well as his criminal history, which includes four burglary offenses and several other

 convictions. See PSR ¶¶ 4, 30-36. Despite these facts, the Court is not persuaded

 Mr. Bowers is a flight risk or dangerous. Mr. Bowers only had one violation of his

 conditions of release and the PO described him as “generally compliant.” PSR ¶ 4.

 Also, at his sentencing hearing on November 16, 2020, numerous family members,

 including his wife and children, and supporters were present and spoke on his behalf,

 and they reflect his substantial ties to Maine, which he would have to sever if he fled.



                                            17
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 18 of 35            PageID #: 606




 The Court has taken a measure of Mr. Bowers and, despite his criminal history, it is

 convinced that if released, he will not flee and will abide by the conditions of release.

       As for his burglary convictions, the Court notes that three of his offenses

 occurred in quick succession in 2006 when Mr. Bowers was eighteen years of age and

 the fourth occurred in 2010. Aside from his 2016 federal offense, which was for

 unlawful possession of a firearm, Mr. Bowers has had no criminal convictions since

 2010. The Court views the amount of time between his prior burglary convictions

 and the present day as sufficiently mitigating any concerns stemming from Mr.

 Bowers’ criminal history.

       Turning to the circumstances of his latest offense, the Court has a very

 different opinion than the AUSA as to who was the aggressor and about the general

 circumstances of the offense. The Court agrees with the Government that Mr. Bowers

 should not have possessed a firearm. But it does not see the rest of the underlying

 facts the way the AUSA sees them. The Court views Justin Taylor, not Mr. Bowers,

 as the aggressor in the assault at the Taylor garage on April 6, 2016 and, even though

 Mr. Bowers possessed a firearm and momentarily touched the firearm a couple of

 times as Mr. Taylor became more and more aggressive, the Court is not convinced

 that Mr. Bowers ever drew the firearm during the altercation. Instead, despite

 having a firearm that likely would have thwarted Mr. Taylor’s wrench attack, Mr.

 Bowers did not pull it out. Rather, he took a bad beating at the hands of Mr. Taylor,

 resulting in significant personal injuries.




                                               18
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 19 of 35           PageID #: 607




         The Court also considered Mr. Bowers’ health. The Court views this factor as

 favoring a finding that he is neither a flight risk nor dangerous. As a result of the

 altercation giving rise to his ACCA conviction, Mr. Bowers suffered a traumatic brain

 injury—a concussion—though a CT scan revealed no evidence of a skull fracture or

 intracranial bleeding. PSR ¶ 49. He continues to report physical complications from

 his assault including hearing loss for which he uses hearing aids, migraine

 headaches, vertigo spells with falling, a recent potential seizure, and concentration

 and memory issues. Id. ¶¶ 49-50. The Court views these neurological impairments

 as weighing against finding Mr. Bowers is a flight risk or a danger to the community.

         Finally, the Court has considered Mr. Bowers’ relative poverty, his family, and

 the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Mr. Bowers is a father of two and a husband of

 one. PSR ¶ 46. Both of his children are young, and his wife is disabled as a result of

 a traumatic brain injury. Id. It appears the Bowers family relies substantially on

 government programs to make ends meet. Id. ¶ 61. Mr. Bowers’ connection to his

 family and their limited financial resources support a finding that he is not a flight

 risk.

         On balance, the Court concludes Mr. Bowers has shown by clear and

 convincing evidence he is not a flight risk or a danger to the community.

         C.    Delay

         The Court concludes Mr. Bowers is not appealing this Court’s application of

 the ACCA for purposes of delay.        Throughout his prosecution, and as early as

 September 2018, Mr. Bowers has maintained that First Circuit precedent on the



                                           19
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 20 of 35            PageID #: 608




 ACCA does not directly speak to whether his convictions qualify as ACCA predicate

 offenses. It has always been the Court’s understanding that Mr. Bowers raised those

 arguments in good faith. See Mem. in Aid of Sentencing at 4-9 (ECF No. 86); First

 Sentencing Order at 7-11; Second Sentencing Order at 5-6.

       D.     Substantial Question Likely to Result in Reversal

       The dispositive issue for Mr. Bowers’ motion for release pending appeal is

 whether his appeal “raises a substantial question of law or fact likely to result in” a

 reversal, new trial, non-incarcerative sentence, or a reduction of his sentence to less

 time in prison than he has already served.       18 U.S.C. § 3143(b)(1).    The Court

 concludes it does not.

              1.     Legal Standard

       According to the First Circuit, the substantial question prong requires a trial

 court to consider two factors: substantiality and prejudice. See United States v.

 Zimny, 857 F.3d 97, 99 (1st Cir. 2017) (citing Bayko, 774 F.2d at 522). First, a court

 must consider whether the question on appeal is “substantial.” Id. Essentially, this

 prong considers whether the issue the defendant raises on appeal is a close question,

 that is, one the appellate court could reasonably decide differently than the district

 court. See id. at 99-100 (“In Bayko, we decided that a substantial question means a

 close question or one that very well could be decided the other way”) (quoting Bayko,

 774 F.2d at 523) (internal quotation marks omitted).

       The second factor is prejudice. Id. at 99. The First Circuit refers to this as

 “the likelihood prong.” Id. Under Bayko, “analysis of the likelihood prong proceeds



                                           20
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 21 of 35            PageID #: 609




 on the assumption that the substantial question of law or fact ‘is determined

 favorably to defendant on appeal.’” Id. at 100 (quoting Bayko, 774 F.2d at 522). Thus,

 the relevant question is whether Mr. Bowers’ conviction will be reversed, or his term

 of incarceration will be less than the time he has already served if the First Circuit

 rules in Mr. Bowers’ favor. Id. at 100-01; 18 U.S.C. § 3143(b)(1).

              2.     The Substantial Question Prong

       With respect to substantiality, the Court concludes Mr. Bowers’ appeal does

 not raise a substantial question of law. The Court twice addressed whether the Maine

 burglary statute is generic under the ACCA. First Sentencing Order at 7-11; Second

 Sentencing Order at 6-17. Both times, the Court rejected Mr. Bowers’ argument, most

 recently on August 21, 2020.       Second Sentencing Order at 6-17.         The Court

 incorporates its earlier analysis of this issue in the two sentencing orders.

       The Court observes that for purposes of determining whether Mr. Bowers has

 raised a substantial question, the test is slightly different than the way these issues

 were presented in the Court’s prior rulings.      This is because this Court earlier

 addressed whether First Circuit precedent required the Court to apply the ACCA. As

 an inferior court within the First Circuit, this Court owes strict allegiance to the

 decisions of the United States Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals for the First

 Circuit and the only question was whether, in this case, the First Circuit had issued

 authoritative opinions on the issues before this Court. Once the Court concluded it

 had done so, it was bound to apply them, and its earlier decisions ended with its




                                           21
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 22 of 35            PageID #: 610




 conclusion that the First Circuit had issued definitive and binding decisions on this

 issue.

          Here the question is slightly different: whether Mr. Bowers would raise a

 substantial question on appeal. This requires a trial court’s prediction as to whether

 its governing appellate court would assess a legal question as substantial. In Bayko,

 the First Circuit pointed out that the literal language of § 3143(b)(1)(B)(iv) would

 present a classic "Catch 22," as the district court would be required to conclude its

 own ruling is likely to be reversed. 774 F.2d at 521-22. “[I]f the court had concluded

 it was likely making the wrong decision, it would have made the right one.” United

 States v. Tyler, 324 F. Supp. 2d 69, 70 (D. Me. 2004).

          To make this assessment, the Court begins with the precept that the doctrine

 of stare decisis applies within the First Circuit itself, a concept known as horizontal

 stare decisis.   United States v. Moore-Bush, 963 F.3d 29, 36-38 (1st Cir. 2020),

 vacated, reh’g en banc granted, 982 F.3d 50 (1st Cir. 2020). As the Moore-Bush Court

 noted, “[t]he law of the circuit doctrine protects horizontal precedent, or precedent

 from the same court, meaning that generally ‘a prior panel decision shall not be

 disturbed.’” Id. at 37 (quoting United States v. Lewko, 269 F.3d 64, 66 (1st Cir. 2001)).

 Even so, “a panel of the court of appeals has some flexibility, modest though it may

 be, with respect to its own precedents.” Eulitt v. Me. Dep’t of Educ., 386 F.3d 344,

 349 (1st Cir. 2004). With these principles in mind, the Court will expand upon its

 prior decisions on the ACCA issue, which were cabined by vertical stare decisis to




                                            22
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 23 of 35            PageID #: 611




 assess whether the ACCA issue would raise a substantial question at the Court of

 Appeals level.

       The Court’s conclusion is that the legal question Mr. Bowers raises is not a

 close one, but its conclusion requires a somewhat lengthy explanation.

                     a.     Legal Primer: Duquette, Mathis, Dimott, and Stitt

       For purposes of this motion, a single case citation, United States v. Duquette,

 778 F.3d 314 (1st Cir. 2015), renders insubstantial the question presented by Mr.

 Bowers’ appeal. In Duquette, the First Circuit considered “whether [a defendant’s]

 past burglary convictions under Maine law qualify as violent felonies defined by the

 ACCA . . ..” Id. at 317. To determine whether Maine’s burglary statute was an ACCA

 violent felony, the First Circuit followed the United States Supreme Court’s decision

 in Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575 (1990). The Taylor Court held generic

 burglary is a violent felony under the ACCA and defined generic burglary as “any

 crime, regardless of its exact definition or label, having the basic elements of unlawful

 or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to

 commit a crime.” Taylor, 495 U.S. at 599.

       Analyzing Taylor, the First Circuit opined in Duquette “[n]owhere does Taylor

 indicate (or even imply) that whether the burgled structure is a dwelling has anything

 to do with determining whether the guilty individual committed a ‘generic burglary.’”

 Duquette, 778 F.3d at 317. Applying Taylor to the Maine burglary statute, the

 Duquette Court held “[b]y its clear and unambiguous terms, the statute contains all




                                            23
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 24 of 35                        PageID #: 612




 of the elements of ‘generic burglary’ that the Supreme Court set forth in Taylor.” 2 Id.

 at 318. The Duquette Court went on to “find . . . that this statutory definition of

 burglary ‘substantially corresponds to generic burglary’” and concluded that “because

 Maine’s burglary statute sets forth the definition of ‘generic burglary,’ under Taylor,

 a conviction under that statute qualifies as a ‘violent felony’ under the ACCA.” Id.

        Thus, as of 2015, the law in the First Circuit was clear: Maine burglary

 convictions are generic burglaries under the ACCA’s enumerated predicate offense

 clause. Under United States v. Chhien, 266 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2001), prior First Circuit

 decisions are “inviolate, absent either the occurrence of a controlling intervening

 event (e.g., a Supreme Court opinion on the point; a ruling of the circuit, sitting en

 banc; or a statutory overruling) or, in extremely rare circumstances, where non-

 controlling but persuasive case law suggests such a course.” Id. at 11. As such, the

 issue becomes whether subsequent developments in the caselaw have eroded

 Duquette to the point where Mr. Bowers’ appeal presents a close question.

        A year after Duquette, the United States Supreme Court decided United States

 v. Mathis, 136 S. Ct. 2243 (2016). Mathis held that Iowa’s burglary statute was non-

 generic under the ACCA because it extended to vehicle burglaries and was therefore

 broader than the generic definition of burglary. Id. at 2251. Two years after Mathis,

 the First Circuit decided Dimott v. United States, 881 F.3d 232 (1st Cir. 2018), which


 2       Mr. Bowers is correct that the defendant in Duquette conceded Maine burglary was generic
 burglary. Def.’s Reply at 2 n.2; Duquette, 778 F.3d at 318. However, the Court does not view this as
 undercutting Duquette’s precedential value. The Duquette Court independently performed a Taylor
 analysis and determined Maine burglary was generic, despite that defendant’s concession. Duquette,
 778 F.3d at 318. He is, however, correct that Duquette did not interpret whether Maine’s definition of
 structure under 17-A M.R.S. § 2(24) substantially corresponds with the definition of generic burglary.
 Even so, the Court is unconvinced this omission calls Duquette into question.

                                                  24
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 25 of 35            PageID #: 613




 partly considered Duquette’s continued validity post-Mathis in a consolidated appeal

 of three habeas petitions. Id. at 233-34. There, the First Circuit rejected two of the

 habeas petitioners’ claims that Maine burglary is non-generic under Mathis as barred

 because the “Mathis did not announce a new, retroactively applicable rule.” Id. at 237

 (citing Mathis, 136 S. Ct. at 2257). As for the third habeas petitioner, in considering

 whether he was sentenced under the ACCA’s residual clause or the enumerated

 clause, referencing Duquette, the First Circuit noted that “the opinion describes its

 holding as a ‘straightforward’ application of the 1990 Supreme Court decision in

 Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575 (1990).” Id. at 241.

       In partial dissent, Judge Torruella concluded “Mathis is subsequent

 controlling authority which calls into question the vitality of our opinion in Duquette.”

 Id. at 246 (citing United States v. Whindleton, 797 F.3d 105, 113 (1st Cir. 2015)). He

 further asserted that “Mathis has undermined” the First Circuit’s prior analysis in

 Duquette and therefore requires the First Circuit “to determine if one (or more) of the

 elements of Maine burglary is broader than the corresponding element of the generic

 offense.” Id.

       On December 10, 2018, the Supreme Court decided United States v. Stitt,

 139 S. Ct. 399 (2018). Stitt considered whether burglary statutes from Tennessee

 and Arkansas, where burglary includes entry into vehicles or structures adapted for

 or customarily used for overnight accommodation, are generic under the ACCA. Id.

 at 403-04. The Court concluded those statutes were generic. Id. at 404. In reaching

 this conclusion the Supreme Court reasoned that it “made clear in Taylor that



                                            25
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 26 of 35            PageID #: 614




 Congress intended the definition of ‘burglary’ to reflect ‘the generic sense in which

 the term [was] used in the criminal codes of most States’ at the time the [ACCA] was

 passed.” Id. at 406. Moreover, at that time “a majority of state burglary statutes

 covered vehicles adapted or customarily used for lodging—either explicitly or by

 defining ‘building’ or ‘structure’ to include those vehicles.” Id.

       The Stitt Court distinguished Mathis, noting that “the question [in Mathis]

 was whether federal generic ‘burglary’ includes within its scope a burglary statute

 that lists multiple, alternative means of satisfying one element, some of which fall

 within Taylor’s generic definition and some of which fall outside it. We held, in light

 of the parties’ agreement that the Iowa statute covered some ‘outside’ behavior . . .

 that the statute did not count as a generic burglary statute.” Id. at 407. The Stitt

 Court continued, noting that “the Court in Mathis did not decide the question now

 before [it]—that is, whether coverage of vehicles designed or adapted for overnight

 use takes the statute outside the generic burglary definition.” Id.

       As the Court discussed in its second sentencing order, the First Circuit has

 continued to apply Duquette after Mathis and Stitt, describing it “as a straightforward

 application of the 1990 Supreme Court decision in Taylor . . ..” Second Sentencing

 Order at 8-10 (citing J., Yeaton v. United States, No. 17-1452 (1st Cir. Jan. 29, 2020))

 (internal quotation marks omitted). The First Circuit has rejected other appeals by

 similarly situated defendants on the same grounds, relying on Duquette’s conclusion

 that Maine burglary is generic under the ACCA. Id. at 9-10 (Black v. United States,

 No. 18-1311 (1st Cir. Jan. 28, 2020); United States v. Bender, No. 16-2062 (1st Cir.



                                            26
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 27 of 35                PageID #: 615




 Jan. 28, 2020); Platt v. United States, No. 16-1961 (1st Cir. Jan. 28, 2020) (denial of

 a second or successive 28 U.S.C. § 2255 motion); Yeaton, supra.

                      b.     Duquette Remains Good Law

        After surveying the caselaw for a third time, the Court remains confident that

 Duquette lives on. The Court is unpersuaded that Judge Torruella’s Mathis-based

 dissent in Dimott, written before Stitt, calls Duquette into question. Furthermore, in

 the Court’s view, neither the pre-Mathis caselaw, Mathis itself, nor post-Mathis

 caselaw supports overturning Duquette.

        Importantly, Mathis did not depart from prior ACCA caselaw sufficient to

 displace Duquette, at least as it relates to whether Maine burglary is generic. 3 As the

 Mathis Court wrote, “[o]ur precedents make this a straightforward case.” Mathis,

 136 S. Ct. at 2257. Mathis did not break new ground by concluding automobiles are

 not structures within the meaning of generic burglary. See id. at 2250 (citing Taylor,

 495 U.S. at 598, for the premise that Iowa’s burglary statute was non-generic because

 vehicles are not structures); see also Dimott, 881 F.3d at 237 (concluding, in the

 habeas context, that Mathis did not announce a new rule retroactive on collateral

 review). Before Mathis, the Supreme Court had reached the same conclusion more

 than twenty-five years earlier in Taylor and subsequently applied it in Shepard v.

 United States, 544 U.S. 13 (2005). See Taylor, 495 U.S. at 599 (describing state

 burglary statutes encompassing “automobiles and vending machines” as broader

 than the generic definition); accord Shepard, 544 U.S. at 17 (describing


 3      It is the Court’s understanding that Mr. Bowers’ appeal does not argue Mathis obviated
 Duquette’s implicit conclusion that Maine’s burglary statute is divisible.

 Massachusetts’ burglary statute as non-generic under Taylor because the statute

 criminalized unlawful entries into boats and cars). Thus, nothing in Mathis altered

 the legal framework the First Circuit employed in Duquette.

       Stitt further parries the thrust of Mr. Bowers’ Mathis-based arguments. As

 the Supreme Court explained in Stitt, Mathis considered whether a statute that listed

 multiple ways to satisfy one element was generic ACCA burglary when some of the

 ways to meet that element were broader than generic burglary. See Stitt, 139 S. Ct.

 at 407 (discussing Mathis). Mathis determined that such a statute was not generic,

 because vehicles are not structures, and therefore Iowa’s burglary statute was

 broader than generic ACCA burglary. Mathis, 136 S. Ct. 2250-51. Stitt somewhat

 qualified this conclusion, clarifying that generic ACCA burglary includes burglaries

 of vehicles customarily used or equipped for overnight accommodation. Stitt, 139 S.

 Ct. at 404.

       In reaching its conclusion, Stitt reiterated that Taylor extends generic burglary

 to “a building or other structure.”   Id at 405 (quoting Taylor, 495 U.S. at 598).

 Therefore, the scope of places that may be burgled is not confined to places where

 people may be sleeping or present. Id. at 406 (“[A] burglary is no less a burglary

 because it took place at a summer home during the winter, or a commercial building

 during a holiday”).   Moreover, Stitt reaffirmed Taylor as the operative test to

 determine whether a burglary statute is generic and instructs Courts to consider

 whether the generic state burglary statutes at the time of the ACCA’s passage




                                          28
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 29 of 35           PageID #: 617




 criminalized entry into a particular place. See id. (applying Taylor and surveying

 state burglary statutes at the time of the ACCA’s passage).

       In short, Stitt reveals Mathis did not redefine how a court should determine

 the meaning of “structure” for purposes of ACCA generic burglary. Thus, to the

 extent Mr. Bowers’ argues on appeal that Mathis requires a court to determine

 whether the burgled entity is a “structure” through judicial interpretation, he is

 mistaken. Taylor and Stitt make manifest that the operative question is largely a

 matter of history. It asks whether the generic state burglary statute at the time of

 the ACCA’s passage extended to the particular burgled object. In other words, Stitt

 makes clear that Mathis does not require courts to determine the meaning of

 “structure” through judicial gloss.

       Stitt contains one more lesson.      Perhaps most damaging to Mr. Bowers’

 argument that Mathis renders Maine burglary non-generic is that Stitt listed Maine’s

 burglary statute as of 1983 in an appendix as an example of a generic burglary statute

 that included vehicles equipped for overnight accommodation. Id. at 408 (appendix).

 In 1983, 17-A M.R.S. § 401(1) provided: “A person is guilty of burglary if he enters or

 surreptitiously remains in a structure, knowing that he is not licensed or privileged

 to do so, with the intent to commit a crime therein.” See State v. Vachon, 482 A.2d

 864, 866 n.1 (Me. 1983) (quoting 17-A M.R.S. § 401(1) (1983)).         Despite minor

 amendments, Maine’s burglary statute is substantially the same now as it was in

 1983. See 17-A M.R.S. § 401(1) (2021) (“A person is guilty of burglary if . . . [t]he

 person enters or surreptitiously remains in a structure knowing that that person is



                                           29
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 30 of 35           PageID #: 618




 not licensed or privileged to do so, with the intent to commit a crime therein”). The

 definition of “structure” in the Maine Criminal Code has been the same since 1977.

 See 17-A M.R.S. § 2(24) (last amended in 1977). Mr. Bowers provides no explanation

 for why the Court should disregard the Supreme Court’s strong intimation that

 Maine burglary was, and now is, generic.

       Summing up, given the language of Maine’s burglary statute and the Supreme

 Court’s decision in Stitt, Mathis cannot be read to render Maine’s burglary statute

 non-generic. To meet the § 3143(b)(1)(B) “substantial question” standard, Mr. Bowers

 must show that his appeal raises “a ‘close’ question or one that very well could be

 decided the other way.” Zimny, 857 F.3d at 99-100. The Court does not regard Mr.

 Bowers’ appellate issue as “close” within this definition. Moreover, neither Mathis

 nor Stitt overruled the generic burglary test from Taylor and replaced it with a

 different legal standard.

       This brings Mr. Bowers back to Duquette. In effect, he argues that the First

 Circuit could reasonably reach a different decision now than it did six years ago in

 Duquette, despite analyzing the same Maine burglary statute under the same legal

 test, with no material intervening developments in the caselaw.            Despite its

 reservations about the length of the sentence it imposed on Mr. Bowers, the Court

 cannot stretch his contentions into a close legal question on appeal as the law defines

 it. Because 18 U.S.C. § 3145(c) requires a defendant first to show that he “meets the

 conditions of release set forth in . . . section 3143(b)(1),” and Mr. Bowers had not




                                           30
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 31 of 35          PageID #: 619




 raised a “substantial question,” he has likewise failed to meet the standards for

 release under § 3145(c).

              3.        The Likelihood Prong

       Mr. Bowers satisfies the likelihood prong; however, the Court cannot release

 him because he fails the substantiality prong. Without the ACCA enhancement, the

 fifteen-year mandatory minimum would not apply to Mr. Bowers and his sentencing

 guideline range would fall to thirty-seven to forty-six months, a fine between $10,000

 and $100,000, and a period of supervised release between one and three years. First

 Sentencing    Order     at   26.   As   Mr.   Bowers   has   been in   custody   since

 September 14, 2017, he has currently been incarcerated for approximately forty-two

 months. If the First Circuit were to vacate the Court’s application of the ACCA, the

 Court would have likely imposed a guideline sentence or less. Thus, Mr. Bowers

 satisfies 18 U.S.C. § 3143(b)(1)(B)(iv) because overturning the ACCA’s applicability

 would lead to “a reduced sentence to a term of imprisonment less than the total of the

 time already served plus the expected duration of the appeal process . . ..” 18 U.S.C.

 § 3142(b)(1)(B)(iv).

       E.     Exceptional Reasons

       Finally, the Court turns to whether Mr. Bowers has shown “exceptional

 reasons” weigh against his continued detention. As the Court noted in Farlow,

 “[w]hat constitutes ‘exceptional reasons’ is unclear.” 824 F. Supp. 2d at 196 (citing

 Weiner, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 28794, at *8-9). “[T]he First Circuit has said that

 there must be present a unique combination of circumstances giving rise to situations



                                           31
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 32 of 35           PageID #: 620




 that are out of the ordinary.” Id. (citing Weiner, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 28794, at *8)

 (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court has wide discretion when

 considering whether exceptional reasons exist. Id. In the past, the Court has applied

 the useful non-exhaustive list of eight factors that the Ninth Circuit established in

 United States v. Garcia, 340 F.3d 1013, 1019-21 (9th Cir. 2003) when confronted with

 similar motions for release pending appeal. See Farlow, 824 F. Supp. 2d at 196

 (applying Garcia).

       Mr. Bowers’ current claim of exceptional reasons rests predominantly on the

 fifth Garcia factor, “[w]hether prison would impose unusual hardships on a defendant

 due to serious illness or injury.” Id. (citing Garcia, 340 F.3d at 1019). He has asthma

 and contends the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic presents a serious medical risk to him

 while incarcerated. Def.’s Mot. at 5-7; Med. Record at 2. Moreover, Mr. Bowers argues

 that his prior burglary convictions are not reflective of a “prototypical Armed Career

 Criminal” but rather “occurred when he was 18 or 22 years old, which is the height

 of impetuous decision making and risk taking in young adults . . ..” Def.’s Reply at 4.

       The Court is unconvinced. Turning first to Mr. Bowers’ asthma and COVID-

 19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), several

 factors increase a person’s risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Arguably, the most

 decisive    factor    is    a     person’s     age.        Older     Adults,     CDC,

 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/older-

 adults.html (last visited Apr. 2, 2021). Generally, the risk of COVID-19 increases as

 a person ages, with over eighty percent of deaths occurring in people who are sixty-



                                           32
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 33 of 35                      PageID #: 621




 five or older and more than ninety-five percent occur in people older than forty-five.

 People with Certain Medical Conditions, CDC, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-

 ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html                   (last     visited

 Apr. 2, 2021) (CDC COVID Med. Conditions). Even so, people younger than forty-

 five may still face a high risk of complications. Id. As Mr. Bowers is in his thirties,

 he does not fit within the age-related risk category.

        Regardless of age, people with certain medical conditions may be more likely

 to get severely ill from COVID-19. CDC COVID Med. Conditions. 4 The CDC lists

 asthma as one of these conditions but only if the asthma is moderate to severe. Id.

 According to his wife as reflected in the PSR and in the medical records, Mr. Bowers

 carries a general diagnosis of asthma. But there is no indication of the severity of his

 asthma. Mr. Bowers has not demonstrated that his asthma fits within the moderate

 to severe classification and that he could be more likely to get severely ill from

 COVID-19.

        Second, the fact that Mr. Bowers may be at a heightened risk for serious

 complications from COVID-19 does not mean that he has shown he is likely to

 contract COVID-19 while incarcerated. Mr. Bowers correctly observed that many

 BOP facilities have experienced COVID-19 outbreaks over the last year. Def.’s Reply

 conditions, weakened immune systems from organ transplants, obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m2), severe
 obesity (BMI > 40 kg/m2), pregnancy, sickle cell disease, smoking, and Type 2 diabetes. See CDC
 COVID Med. Conditions. Moreover, the CDC has indicated that individuals with asthma (moderate-
 to-severe), cerebrovascular disease, cystic fibrosis, hypertension, non-organ transplant-related
 immunodeficiencies, neurologic conditions, liver disease, pulmonary fibrosis, Thalassemia, Type 1
 diabetes, or who are overweight (BMI > 25 kg/m2), may be more likely to get severely ill from COVID-
 19. Id.

 at 5.   Even so, the Government is also correct that the BOP has implemented

 “measures [that] are designed to mitigate sharply the risks of COVID-19

 transmission in a BOP institution.” Gov’t’s Opp’n at 15. Moreover, the BOP has made

 substantial progress in inoculating both BOP staff and inmates and that vaccination

 process is ongoing. The BOP website states that it has received 107,675 doses of

 vaccine and has administered 109,657 doses.            Covid-19 Coronavirus, BOP,

 https://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/index.jsp (last visited Apr. 2, 2021).        There is

 some variation among different BOP institutions in their success in preventing

 outbreaks and the distribution of vaccine and without knowing which BOP facility

 will house Mr. Bowers, the Court cannot weigh the particularized risks to him of

 contracting COVID-19 in BOP custody. At most, the Court may conclude the prison

 environment is not an ideal setting for Mr. Bowers to practice social distancing and

 mitigate his potential risk of COVID-19 exposure. On balance the Court concludes

 that this risk, combined with Mr. Bowers’ medical conditions, falls short of

 exceptional reasons that render his detention inappropriate.

         Finally, even if the Court is sympathetic to Mr. Bowers’ argument that he is

 not the “prototypical Armed Career Criminal,” this does not mean he should be

 released pending appeal. 18 U.S.C. § 3143(b)(2) requires all ACCA felons be detained

 unless they fall within 18 U.S.C. § 3145(c). The Court’s views on the seriousness of

 Mr. Bowers’ predicate offenses do not supplant § 3143(b)(2)’s requirement that ACCA

 felons be detained. Such a reading of § 3145(c) would call upon the Court to draw

 imprecise lines among different types of prior offenses that all nonetheless qualify as



                                           34
Case 1:16-cr-00151-JAW Document 136 Filed 04/02/21 Page 35 of 35   PageID #: 623




 ACCA predicates. The Court declines to take such a view and concludes that Mr.

 Bowers’ ACCA predicates and his overall presentation do not amount to an

 exceptional reason for release pending appeal.
