Memorandum

To: The Honorable Rya W. Zobel, Senior U.S. District Judge
From: Marlenny Ramdehal, U.S. Probation Officer
Date: May 3, 2016

Re: Mervil, Emmanuel
Docket Number: 1:08-cr-10101
Request for International Travel

 

The purpose of this memorandum is to advise the Court that the above captioned
defendant has requested permission to Cancun, Mexico the week of June 23, 2016 to
attend a wedding. Mr. Mervil appeared before the Honorable Joseph L. Tauro on
6/19/2013, having previously pled guilty to Felon in Possession of a Firearm, in violation
of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). On that date, he was sentenced to 48 months’ custody of the
Bureau of Prisons, followed by 3 years’ of supervised release.

In accordance with our office’s district policy, the undersigned probation officer contacted
the Consulate General of Mexico in an attempt to receive written permission for Mr.
Mervil to travel to their country. This Officer has not yet received written confirmation
from the Consulate General of Mexico granting Mr. Mervil’s travel request.

Mr. Mervil commenced his term of supervised release on 7/10/2015 and during that
period has complied with all terms of supervision imposed by the Court. Due to Mr.
Mervil’s overall compliance with his conditions thus far, the U.S. Probation Office is
inclined to allow this request even without the Consulate’s response. If Your Honor has
no objection to this travel despite the lack of permission from the Mexican Consulate,
please kindly indicate by signing below.
