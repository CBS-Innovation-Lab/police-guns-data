                            RE: RULE 11 PROCEEDINGS (PLEA OF GUILTY)

 2   II.      Consent to Proceed Before a Magistrate Judge
 3            On March 17, 2014, while assisted by counsel the defendant, by consent, appeared before the
 4   undersigned in order to change his previous not guilty plea to a plea of guilty as to counts one and two
 5   of the indictment. In open court the defendant was questioned as to the purpose of the hearing being
 6   held and was advised of: (a) the nature and purpose of the hearing; (b) the fact that all inquiries were
 7   to be conducted under oath and that it was expected that his answers would be truthful; (c) the potential
 8   consequences of lying under oath (such as a perjury charge); and (d) his right to have the change of plea
 9   proceedings presided by a district judge instead of a magistrate judge. The defendant was also
10   explained the differences between the appointment and functions of the two. The defendant consented
11   to proceed before the undersigned magistrate judge.
12   III.     Proceedings Under Rule 11, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure
13            A.     Rule 11(c)(1) Requirements
14                    Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure governs the acceptance of
              guilty pleas to federal criminal violations. Pursuant to Rule 11, in order for a plea of
15            guilty to constitute a valid waiver of the defendant’s right to trial, guilty pleas must be
              knowing and voluntary: “Rule 11 was intended to ensure that a defendant who pleads
16            guilty does so with an ‘understanding of the nature of the charge and consequences of
              his plea.’” United States v. Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting
17            McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 467 (1969)). [There are three core concerns
              in these proceedings]: 1) absence of coercion; 2) understanding of the charges; and 3)
18            knowledge of the consequences of the guilty plea. United States v. Cotal-Crespo, 47
              F.3d at 4 (citing United States v. Allard, 926 F.2d 1237, 1244-45 (1st Cir. 1991)). United
19            States v. Hernández-Wilson, 186 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1999).
20            B. Admonishment of Constitutional Rights
21            To assure defendant’s understanding and awareness of his rights, defendant was advised of his
22   right:
23            1.   To remain silent at trial and be presumed innocent, since it is the government who has the
24   burden of proving his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
25            2.   To testify or not to testify at trial, and that no adverse inference could be made in relation
26   to his decision not to testify.

 2            3.   To a speedy trial before a district judge and a jury, at which he would be entitled to see and
 3    cross examine the government witnesses, present evidence on his behalf, and challenge the
 4    government’s evidence.
 5           4.    To have a unanimous verdict rendered by a jury of twelve persons which would have to be
 6 convinced of defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt by means of admissible evidence.
 7           5.    To use the subpoena power of the court to compel the attendance of witnesses.
 8           Upon listening to the defendant’s responses, observing his demeanor and his speaking with his
 9 attorney, that to the best of counsel’s belief defendant had fully understood his rights, it is determined
10 that defendant is aware of his constitutional rights.
11           C. Consequences of Pleading Guilty
12           Upon advising defendant of his constitutional rights, he was further advised of the consequences
13 of pleading guilty. Specifically, defendant was advised that by pleading guilty and upon having his
14 guilty plea accepted by the court, he will be giving up the above rights and will be convicted solely on
15 his statement that he is guilty.
16           Furthermore, the defendant was admonished of the fact that by pleading guilty he would not be
17 allowed later on to withdraw his plea because he eventually might disagree with the sentence imposed,
18 and that if he violates the conditions of supervised release, that privilege could be revoked and he could
19 be required to serve an additional term of imprisonment. He was also explained that parole has been
20 abolished.
21           In response to further questioning, defendant was explained and he understood that if convicted on
22 count one he will face the following penalties: a term of imprisonment of not more than five (5) years, a fine
23 not greater than $250,000, and a term of supervised release of at least two (2) years.
24           Defendant was explained and he understood that if convicted on count two he will face the
25 following penalties: a mandatory consecutive term of imprisonment of at least five (5) years up to life,
26 a fine not to exceed $250,000, and a term of supervised release of not more than five (5) years. The
27 sentence of count two must be served consecutive to the sentence in count one.

 2             The defendant was also explained what the supervised release term means. Defendant was also
 3 made aware that the court must impose a mandatory penalty assessment of one hundred dollars ($100)
 4 per offense pursuant Title 18, United States Code, Section 3013(a).
 5             The defendant was advised that the ultimate sentence was a matter solely for the court to decide
 6 in its discretion and that, even if the maximum imprisonment term and fine were to be imposed upon
 7 him, he later could not withdraw his guilty plea for that reason alone. The defendant understood this.
 8             D. Plea Agreement1
 9             The parties have entered into a written plea agreement that, upon being signed by the
10 government, defense attorney and defendant, was filed and made part of the record. Defendant was
11 clearly warned and recognized having understood that the sentencing guidelines contained in the plea
12 agreement are advisory and thus, not mandatory or binding on the court.
13             E. Government's Evidence (Basis in Fact)
14             The government presented a proffer of its evidence consistent with the version of facts of the plea
15 agreement with which the defendant concurred. Accordingly, it is determined that there is a basis in fact
16 and evidence to establish all the elements of the offense charged.
17             F. Voluntariness
18             The defendant accepted that no threats had been made to induce him to plead guilty and that he
19 did not feel pressured to plead guilty.
20             G. Waiver of Appeal
21             The defendant was explained, and he understood, that if the court accepts the plea agreement and
22 sentences him according to its terms, conditions and recommendations, he will be surrendering his right
23 to appeal the sentence and judgment in this case.
24   IV.       Conclusion
25             The defendant, by consent, has appeared before me pursuant to Rule 11, Federal Rules of
26 Criminal Procedure, has entered a plea of guilty as to counts one and two of the indictment. After

 2 cautioning and examining the defendant under oath and in open court, concerning each of the subject
 3 matters mentioned in Rule 11, as described in the preceding sections, I find that defendant is competent
 4 to enter this guilty plea, is aware of the nature of the offenses charged and the maximum statutory
 5 penalties that the same carry, understands that the charges are supported by the government’s evidence,
 6 has admitted to every element of the offenses charged, and has done so in an intelligent and voluntary
 7 manner with full knowledge of the consequences of his guilty plea. Therefore, I recommend that the
 8 court accept the guilty plea of the defendant and that the defendant be adjudged guilty as to counts one
 9 and two of the indictment.
10          Any objections to this report and recommendation must be specific and must be filed with the
11 Clerk of Court within fourteen (14) days of its receipt. Failure to timely file specific objections to the
12 report and recommendation is a waiver of the right to review by the district court. United States v.
13 Valencia-Copete, 792 F.2d 4 (1st Cir. 1986).
14          SO RECOMMENDED.
15          At San Juan, Puerto Rico, this 18th day of March, 2014.
