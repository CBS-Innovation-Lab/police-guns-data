                    REPORT OF PRE-TRIAL CONFERENCE & ORDER

        On August 29, 2022, the Court held a telephonic status conference to discuss preparing for

 trial in this matter, which is currently on the October 2022 trial list. Assistant United States

 Attorneys David Joyce and Johnathan Nathans appeared for the Government. Attorneys Timothy

 Zerillo and Stephen Sweatt appeared for Defendants Brian Bilodeau and Brian Bilodeau LLC

 (together, the “Bilodeau Defendants”).

        To the extent that two other corporate Defendants remain in this matter (TY Properties

 LLC & TY Construction LLC), the Government confirmed that it will dismiss the charges pending

 against these two Defendants without prejudice before jury selection. Thus, only the Bilodeau

 Defendants will proceed to trial in October 2022.

        Jury Selection: October 3, 2022

        Counsel confirmed that they are prepared to proceed to jury selection on October 3, 2022.

 Both sides orally indicated their consent to jury selection before the Magistrate Judge. However,

 the Court instructed counsel for both the Government and the Bilodeau Defendants to file a written

 consent on the docket.

         Trial: October 11-14 & 17-20, 2022

         Given that only the Bilodeau Defendants are proceeding to trial, counsel agreed that this

 matter can be tried in six days or less. As a result, the Court has reserved October 11, 2022 through

 October 20, 2022 for trial and jury deliberations in this matter.

         All trial briefs and requested instructions shall be filed on or before September 26, 2022.

         Motions in Limine

         With respect to motions in limine, Attorney Zerillo indicated that he intends to respond to

 the three motions already filed by the Government (ECF Nos. 1147-1149) by September 6, 2022.

 Any reply shall be filed on or before September 14, 2022.

         Any additional motions in limine shall be filed on or before September 14, 2022.

 Responses to those motions shall be filed no later than September 23, 2022. While a reply is not

 required, the Court will consider any reply filed by September 30, 2022.

         Other Issues

         The Government raised two other issues for discussion. First, in order to correct an error

 related to Count 14, it plans to seek a superseding indictment. However, counsel agreed that this

 amendment to the Indictment would not require any delay in the trial schedule. Second, the

 Government raised the need to have one expert witness appear by video. Attorney Zerillo indicated

 he would consent to video testimony by this one witness. Counsel shall submit either a stipulation

 or unopposed motion for this witness to appear by video. The Government shall coordinate this

 video appearance with the Courtroom Deputy and the Court’s I.T. Department in order to avoid

 any delay of trial.

         SO ORDERED.
