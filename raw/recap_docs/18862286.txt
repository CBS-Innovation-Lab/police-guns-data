                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 08-cr-24-PB

Corey Gagnon


                                  O R D E R

     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

May 6, 2008 trial in the above case to allow additional time to

complete discovery and prepare a defense.           The government does

not object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reason and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from May 6, 2008 to October 7, 2008.              In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reason, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial

     The April 30, 2008 final pretrial conference is continued to

September 29, 2008 at 4:00 p.m.
