                    UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                          DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


USA


       v.                                   Criminal No. 09-cr-51-01-PB

Jamie Hrycuna


                                    O R D E R



       Defendant, in separate motions, seeks discovery.             The

government filed a consolidated objection.             The requests are

considered in order.

       1.      Defendant’s Statements

               Defendant requests all oral and written statements by

him.    The government responded by stating that all written

statements, including his Miranda waiver, have now been produced.

The government has not objected to producing defendant’s oral

statements, although it is not clear that any exist.               Moot as to

written statements, granted as to oral statements.

       2.      Physical Evidence

               a.    Government has not identified its trial physical

                     evidence.

                     In accordance with United States District Court
             Case 1:09-cr-00051-PB Document 24 Filed 06/30/09 Page 2 of 4




District of New Hampshire Local Rule 16.1(f), the government

agrees to provide its exhibit list seven (7) days before trial.

Moot.

                b.    Disclose all physical evidence taken from 599

                      Union Street or from Hrycuna and Bond.

                      The government has repeatedly agreed to permit

defense counsel to examine all such physical evidence.                Moot.

                c.    Disclose expert related evidence.

                      Granted with respect to all testimony the

government intends to use under Federal Rules of Criminal

Evidence 702, 703 and 705.

        3.      Evidence Favorable to the Defendant

                Granted by agreement: the government will disclose all

such evidence at least twenty (20) days prior to trial.                 LR

16.1(c).

        4.      Facts Material to Proof

                Defendant complains that the indictment does not

specify which of the 53 firearms he possessed or where in New

Hampshire he possessed them.            The indictment clearly alleges that

he possessed each and every one of 53 weapons.               With respect to

location “the absence of statement of the . . . locations . . .

does not necessarily render the indictment impermissibly vague.”

U.S. v. Hallock, 941 F.2d 36, 41 (1st Cir. 1991).            If defendant

has some argument that the lack of a more precise location will

prejudice or surprise him, he should make it.             “It is not the job

of this . . . court to construct arguments . . . on behalf of a

party.”     Bonnie & Company Fashions, Inc. v. Bankers Trust Co.,

945 F. Supp. 693, 726 (S.D.N.Y. 1996).          Denied.

     5.      Scientific Reports and Examinations

             The government says there is no such material.              The

government cannot be ordered to produce that which does not

exist.    Denied.

     6.      Photographs, Videos and Other Images

             The government states that it has provided all

photographs, videos and images.         Denied.

     7.      Names and Addresses of Witnesses

             The government is to comply with LR 16.1(g).

     8.      Witness Statements

             To the extent it has not already produced witness

statements, the government is ordered to comply with LR 16.1(d).

     9.      Uncharged Misconduct

             The government has agreed to produce any such evidence

but has not said when.     It is ordered to do so seven (7) days

before trial.

      10.   Co-Conspirators Statements

            In paragraph “J” of its objection, the government

objects.    This is inconsistent with its paragraph “H” claim that

it has already provided the statements of Guay, Tvetan and Bond.

The paragraph “J” objection and the motion are therefore moot.

      The motions (document nos. 19 and 20) are granted in part,

denied in part, and moot in part.

      SO ORDERED.
