                        UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                     FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE

United States of America

      v.                                         Case No. 09-cr-188-PB

John Selden

                                   O R D E R

      The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

trial scheduled for March 2, 2010, citing the need for additional

time to complete discovery and prepare for trial. The government

does not object to a continuance of the trial date.

      Accordingly, for the above reasons, the court will continue

the trial from March 2, 2010 to June 1, 2010.             In agreeing to

continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ยง

3161(h)(7)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the ends of

justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the best

interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.

      The February 23, 2010 final pretrial conference is continued

to May 19, 2010 at 4:30 p.m.

      SO ORDERED.
