                     UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

ALVIN CAMPBELL                    )

                 ASSENTED-TO MOTION TO EXCLUDE TIME

     The government respectfully moves this Court, pursuant to

18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(A), to exclude the period from September

13, 2006 to and including December 11, 2006 from the time within

which this case would otherwise have to be tried under the Speedy

Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161, et seq. (the “STA”).               As grounds

therefor, the government states that, at the Pretrial Conference

held before this Court on September 13, 2006, counsel for the

defendant requested a trial date in December 2006, informing the

Court that the defendant is also facing state charges, that

counsel in this case and counsel in the state case plan to meet

with the defendant soon in an effort to see whether the

defendant’s cases can be resolved short of trial, and that

accordingly the possibility exists that this matter can be

resolved without a trial.      Given the potential conservation of

judicial and other resources that would be realized if the case

is resolved by plea rather than by trial, and given the benefits

to the parties and the public in eliminating the uncertainties of

trial in the event the matter can be resolved by plea, the

government respectfully requests that this Court find that the

ends of justice served by setting the trial date on December 11,

2006 outweigh the best interests of the public and the defendant

in a speedy trial, and that the Court accordingly order that the

period set forth above be excluded from the STA calculation.

     The defendant, through counsel, has expressed his assent to

the allowance of this motion.

                                   Respectfully submitted,

                                   MICHAEL J. SULLIVAN
