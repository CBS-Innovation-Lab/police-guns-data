                      DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE

           v.                           Criminal N o . 11-cr-37-03-JD

Tiffany Mailhot


                                O R D E R


      The assented to motion to reschedule jury trial (document n o .

24) filed by defendant Mailhot is ruled on as follows: Granted, no

further continuances. Trial is continued as to defendant Mailhot,

as well as her co-defendants who were all in agreement to the

continuance, to the two-week period beginning August 1 6 , 2011, 9:30

AM.

      Defendant Mailhot shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights

within 10 days. The court finds that the ends of justice served by

granting a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and

the defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv), for

the reasons set forth in the motion.

      SO ORDERED.
