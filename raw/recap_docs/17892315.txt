               Respondent                     )

                                             ORDER

       This matter is before the Court on Petitioner’s request that the Court order the Coolidge

House, the halfway house to which Petitioner anticipates he will be transferred, to allow Petitioner

access to local libraries in Boston, Massachusetts, or any other facility which the Court deems

appropriate for legal research.

       Given that Petitioner has not yet been transferred to the Coolidge House, Petitioner’s

request is premature. In addition, at least in the first instance, the manner by which an institution

provides inmates with an adequate law library or legal assistance is within the judgment of the

institution’s administration. See Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 355-57 (1996). Accordingly, the

Court denies Petitioner’s request.

                                          CERTIFICATE

       Any objections to this Order shall be filed in accordance with Fed.R.Crim.P. 59 and
Fed.R.Civ.P. 72.

       So Ordered.
