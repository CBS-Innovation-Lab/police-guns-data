10                            RE: RULE 11 PROCEEDINGS (PLEA OF GUILTY)
                                        1
11
     I.         Procedural Background
12
                On April 18, 2012, a grand jury returned an indictment against Fernando Huertas-Rodríguez,
13
     (hereinafter referred to as “defendant”). (Docket No.11.) The defendant has agreed to plead guilty to count
14
     one of the indictment. Count one charges that on or about April 13, 2012, in the District of Puerto Rico,
15
     and within the jurisdiction of this court, [1] Fernando Huertas-Rodríguez, having been convicted of a crime
16
     punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, aided and abetted by [2] Ángel Ruiz-Navarro,
17   did knowingly possess in and affecting interstate commerce, a firearm, that is: one Type: Pistol, Make:
18   Cobray, Caliber 9mm, Serial Number: XX-XXXXXXX, loaded with thirty (30) rounds of 9mm caliber
19   ammunition in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2), and 2.
20   II.        Consent to Proceed Before a Magistrate Judge
21              On September 19, 2012, while assisted by counsel, the defendant, by consent, appeared before the
22   undersigned in order to change his previous not guilty plea to a plea of guilty as to count one of the
23   indictment. In open court the defendant was questioned as to the purpose of the hearing being held and was
24   advised of: (a) the nature and purpose of the hearing; (b) the fact that all inquiries were to be conducted
25   under oath and that it was expected that his answers would be truthful; (c) the potential consequences of
26   lying under oath (such as a perjury charge); and (d) his right to have the change of plea proceedings
27   presided by a district judge instead of a magistrate judge. The defendant was also explained the differences

 2    between the appointment and functions of the two. The defendant consented to proceed before the
 3    undersigned magistrate judge.
 4    III.    Proceedings Under Rule 11, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure
 5            A.      Rule 11(c)(1) Requirements
 6                    Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure governs the acceptance of guilty
              pleas to federal criminal violations. Pursuant to Rule 11, in order for a plea of guilty to
 7            constitute a valid waiver of the defendant’s right to trial, guilty pleas must be knowing and
              voluntary: “Rule 11 was intended to ensure that a defendant who pleads guilty does so with
 8            an ‘understanding of the nature of the charge and consequences of his plea.’” United States
              v. Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S.
 9            459, 467 (1969)). [There are three core concerns in these proceedings]: 1) absence of
              coercion; 2) understanding of the charges; and 3) knowledge of the consequences of the
10            guilty plea. United States v. Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d at 4 (citing United States v. Allard, 926
              F.2d 1237, 1244-45 (1st Cir. 1991)).
11
      United States v. Hernández-Wilson, 186 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1999).
12
              B. Admonishment of Constitutional Rights
13
              To assure defendant’s understanding and awareness of his rights, defendant was advised of his right:
14
              1.    To remain silent at trial and be presumed innocent, since it is the government who has the
15
      burden of proving his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
16
              2.    To testify or not to testify at trial, and that no adverse inference could be made in relation to
17    his decision not to testify.
18            3.    To a speedy trial before a district judge and a jury, at which he would be entitled to see and
19    cross examine the government witnesses, present evidence on his behalf, and challenge the government’s
20    evidence.
21            4.   To have a unanimous verdict rendered by a jury of twelve persons which would have to be
22 convinced of defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt by means of admissible evidence.
23            5.   To use the subpoena power of the court to compel the attendance of witnesses.
24            Upon listening to the defendant’s responses and observing his demeanor, it is determined that
25 defendant is aware of his constitutional rights.
26            C. Consequences of Pleading Guilty
27            Upon advising defendant of his constitutional rights, he was further advised of the consequences of
28 pleading guilty. Specifically, defendant was advised that by pleading guilty and upon having his guilty plea

 1                                                                3
 2 accepted by the court, he will be giving up the above rights and will be convicted solely on his statement that
 3 he is guilty.
 4              In response to further questioning, defendant was explained and he understood that if convicted on
 5 count one he will face the following penalties: a term of imprisonment of not more than ten (10) years, a fine
 6 not greater than $250,000.00, and a term of supervised release of not more than three (3) years.
 7              The defendant was also explained what the supervised release term means and that if he violates the
 8 conditions of supervised release, that privilege could be revoked and he could be required to serve an
 9 additional term of imprisonment. He was also explained that parole has been abolished. In addition,
10 defendant was made aware that the court must impose a mandatory penalty assessment of one hundred
11 dollars ($100) per offense pursuant Title 18, United States Code, Section 3013(a).
12              D. “Type C” Plea Agreement1

13              The parties have entered into a written plea agreement that, upon being signed by the government,

14 defense attorney and defendant, was filed and made part of the record. Defendant was clearly warned and
15 recognized having understood that the court may accept or reject the plea agreement, or may defer its
16 decision whether to accept or reject the plea agreement until it has considered the pre-sentence report. If
17 the court rejects the plea agreement, the court will inform the parties of this fact and afford the defendant
18 an opportunity to withdraw the guilty plea and advise the defendant that if he persists in a guilty plea, the
     disposition of the case may be less favorable to the defendant than the defendant contemplated in the plea
19
     agreement. Defendant acknowledged having understood these explanations and all the terms and conditions
20
     of the plea agreement.
21
                E. Government's Evidence (Basis in Fact)
22
                The government presented a summary of its evidence consistent with the version of facts of the plea
23
     agreement with which the defendant concurred. Accordingly, it is determined that there is a basis in fact and
24
     evidence to establish all the elements of the offense charged.

 2           F. Voluntariness
 3           The defendant accepted that no threats had been made to induce him to plead guilty and that he did
 4 not feel pressured to plead guilty.
 5           G. Waiver of Appeal
 6           The defendant was explained, and he understood, that if the court accepts the plea agreement and
 7 sentences him according to its terms and conditions, he will be surrendering his right to appeal the sentence
 8 and judgment in this case.
 9 IV.       Conclusion

10           The defendant, by consent, has appeared before me pursuant to Rule 11, Federal Rules of Criminal

11 Procedure, and has entered a plea of guilty as to count one of the indictment. After cautioning and
12 examining the defendant under oath and in open court, concerning each of the subject matters mentioned
13 in Rule 11, as described in the preceding sections, I find that defendant Fernando Huertas-Rodríguez is
14 competent to enter this guilty plea, is aware of the nature of the offense charged and the maximum statutory
15 penalties that the same carries, understands that the charge is supported by the government’s evidence, has
16 admitted to every element of the offense charged, and has done so in an intelligent and voluntary manner
17 with full knowledge of the consequences of his guilty plea. Therefore, I recommend that the court accept
18 the guilty plea of the defendant and that the defendant be adjudged guilty as to count one.
             This report and recommendation is filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B). Any objections to
19
     the same must be specific and must be filed with the Clerk of Court within fourteen (14) days of its receipt.

     Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b). Failure to timely file specific objections to the report and recommendation is a waiver
21
     of the right to review by the district court. United States v. Valencia-Copete, 792 F.2d 4 (1st Cir. 1986).
22
             SO RECOMMENDED.

             In San Juan, Puerto Rico, this 22nd day of October, 2012.
