     ORDER ON DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO VACATE AND DISMISS

      On April 19, 2013, a federal jury convicted Mr. Hines of possession of a

firearm by a person convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence in

violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9). Mr. Hines challenges the Court’s subject matter

jurisdiction over the crime on two grounds.            First, he argues that his

“undifferentiated” state court conviction for misdemeanor domestic violence under

17-A M.R.S. § 207-A(1)(A) does not satisfy the “use or attempted use of physical

force” requirement of 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(33)(A)(ii), which provides a definitional

requirement for his conviction under § 922(g)(9). Second, he contends that his state

court conviction also does not satisfy the requirements of § 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) because

it could have been for merely reckless conduct, rather than knowing or intentional

conduct. A violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9) is an offense against the laws of the

United States and therefore within the subject matter jurisdiction of this Court.

Furthermore, the recent Supreme Court case of United States v. Castleman, 134 S.

Ct. 1405 (2014), squarely forecloses Mr. Hines’s argument that Maine’s domestic

violence statute does not require sufficient physical force to be a valid predicate

offense to § 922(g)(9). However, recent First Circuit authority strongly suggests
that reckless conduct does not amount to use of physical force under 18 U.S.C. §

922(g)(9). The Court vacates Mr. Hines’ conviction and grants him a new trial but

does not dismiss the indictment.

I.    LEGAL STANDARD

      Mr. Hines styles his challenges as being to the subject matter jurisdiction of

the Court. “The district courts of the United States shall have original jurisdiction,

exclusive of the courts of the States, of all offenses against the laws of the United

States.” 18 U.S.C. § 3231.

II.   FACTS

      A.      Procedural History

      On December 13, 2012, a federal grand jury indicted John Thomas Hines for

possessing a firearm after having been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of

domestic violence, an alleged violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9). Indictment (ECF

No. 1).    The indictment supplied the following details about the prior domestic

assault conviction: “Domestic Violence Assault, 17-A M.R.S.A. § 207-A, Waldo

County Superior Court (September 29, 2011)”. Id. at 1. After jury selection on

April 16, 2013, the case went to trial before a federal jury on April 18-19, 2013 and

on April 19, 2013, the jury issued a verdict, finding Mr. Hines guilty as charged.

Jury Verdict Form (ECF No. 68). The Court has scheduled Mr. Hines’ sentencing

hearing for May 19, 2014. Notice of Rescheduled Hr’g (ECF No. 111).

      On February 17, 2014, Mr. Hines moved to vacate the conviction and dismiss

the indictment. Def.’s Mot. to Vacate and Dismiss (ECF No. 96) (Def.’s First Mot.).

The Government responded on March 12, 2014. Resp. of the United States to the

Def.’s Mot. to Vacate and Dismiss the Indictment (ECF No. 101) (Gov’t’s First Opp’n).

On April 2, 2014, the Government brought to the Court’s attention a recent decision

of the United States Supreme Court, United States v. Castleman, 134 S. Ct. 1405

(2014), that it believed might affect the Court’s ruling on the pending motion.

Notice of Authority in Resp. to the Def.’s Mot. to Vacate and Dismiss the Indictment

(ECF No. 105) (Gov’t’s Notice).

       Meanwhile, on March 25, 2014, the Court received a pro se motion from Mr.

Hines, which is styled a motion to vacate and dismiss. Def.’s Mot. to Vacate and

Dismiss (ECF No. 102-3). As Mr. Hines is currently represented by counsel, the

Court followed its standard practice and gave his lawyer an opportunity to review

the motion and to adopt it if appropriate. Letter from Clerk of Courts to Wayne R.

Foote, Esq. (March 25, 2014) (ECF No. 102). The Court has not heard from his

defense counsel and assumes that he has not adopted the pro se motion.

       Finally, on April 8, 2014, Mr. Hines filed a second motion to vacate and

dismiss.   Def.’s Second Mot. to Vacate and Dismiss (ECF No. 109) (Def.’s Second

Mot.). The Government replied in opposition on May 29, 2014, Resp. of the United

States of America to the Def.’s Second Mot. to Vacate and Dismiss the Indictment

(ECF No. 110) (Gov’t’s Second Opp’n), and Mr. Hines replied on May 5, 2014. Def.’s

      B.      Factual Background

              1.   The State Domestic Violence Assault Charge

      On September 29, 2011, John Thomas Hines pleaded guilty in Waldo County

Superior Court for the state of Maine to violating 17-A M.R.S. § 207-A(1)(A). Resp.

of the United States to the Def.’s Mot. to Vacate and Dismiss the Indictment at Ex. 1

J. and Commitment, at 3 (ECF No. 101) (State Conviction).         This state statute

defines and criminalizes “domestic violence assault” where the victim “is a family or

household member.”       Id. § 207-A(1)(A).       Section 207, in turn, criminalizes

“intentionally, knowingly or recklessly caus[ing] bodily injury or offensive physical

contact to another person.” 17-A M.R.S. § 207(1)(A). The state court documents

underlying the State Conviction do not provide any details of the conduct

underlying the offense, nor did such details emerge during the colloquy among the

Court, counsel and Mr. Hines during his guilty plea to the state charge. See Def.’s

Mot. to Vacate and Dismiss at Ex. 1 State of Maine v. John T. Hines, at 0002-0008

(ECF No. 96).

              2.   The Stipulation at Trial

      As trial approached, Mr. Hines submitted a trial brief, explaining that he

expected that the Government would “fail to meet its burden of proving that he

possessed the firearms as alleged.” Def.’s Trial Br. at 1 (ECF No. 40). Significantly,

Mr. Hines informed the Court that he and the Government would jointly stipulate

as follows:

      Mr. Hines was convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence
      on September 29, 2011.




                                              4
Id. at 2. On April 15, 2013, Mr. Hines filed a set of proposed jury instructions,

including:

         The parties have stipulated that Mr. Hines is a person who is legally
         disqualified by law from possessing a firearm/was convicted of a
         misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. You are to take that fact as
         proven.


Def.’s Proposed Jury Instructions at 8 (ECF No. 54). Consistent with the parties’

stipulation, the Court instructed the jury as follows:

         For you to find Mr. Hines guilty of this crime, you must be satisfied
         that the Government has proven each of the following elements beyond
         a reasonable doubt:

         First, that the Defendant was previously convicted in any court of a
         misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. The parties have stipulated
         that the Defendant was convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic
         violence on September 29, 2011. You are to take that fact as proven.

III.     POSITION OF THE PARTIES

         A.    John Thomas Hines’ First Motion

               1.    John Thomas Hines’ Position

         Mr. Hines contends that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Mr.

Hines.     Def.’s Mot. at 2.   This is so, he argues, because “Mr. Hines must have

committed a Misdemeanor Crime of Domestic Violence as that term is defined at

Title 18 USC § 921 (33).” Id. at 2-3. He points out that that section “requires that a

predicate state conviction must have, as an element, the ‘use or attempted use of

physical force’ to qualify as a Misdemeanor Crime of Domestic Violence.” Id. at 3.

         Mr. Hines further argues that 17-A M.R.S. § 207-A cannot be a predicate

offense for 18 U.S.C. § 922 because it permits conviction for either causing bodily

injury or offensive physical contact.     Id.       He blankly asserts that “[a] person


                                                5
convicted of offensively touching another, without violence or the attempted use of

violence, has not committed a federal misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.” Id.

             2.     The Government’s Response

      The Government argues that Mr. Hines’s motion goes not to the subject

matter jurisdiction of the Court but to a claim of a defect in the indictment. Gov’t’s

Opp’n at 2. In the Government’s view, Mr. Hines waived any such objection by

failing to raise it before trial. Id. (citing FED. R. CRIM. P. 12(b)(3); United States v.

DiGregorio, 605 F.2d 1184, 1193 n.10 (1st Cir. 1979); United States v. Mack, 892

F.2d 134, 136 (1st Cir. 1989); and others).

      The Government argues that Mr. Hines is really attacking the sufficiency of

the proof of an element of the crime of which he was convicted. Id. at 3. It views

this attack as missing the mark given Mr. Hines’s stipulation at trial that he had

been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.             Id. at 4.   The

Government insists that the Court must only consider the categorical definition of

the underlying crime, not the actual facts underlying the offense. Id. It urges, in

other words, that the Court should consider only the elements of Maine’s domestic

violence statute. Id. Finally, the Government asserts that the First Circuit case of

United States v. Booker, 644 F.3d 12 (1st Cir. 2011), held that Maine’s domestic

violence assault statute is a valid predicate offense for the purposes of 18 U.S.C. §

922(g)(9). Id. at 5-6 (citing Booker, 644 F.3d at 17, 21). The Government also cites

United States v. Armstrong, 706 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2013) (Armstrong I), for further

support of the same proposition. Id. at 6. Finally, the Government argues that the




                                               6
Supreme Court’s recent decision in United States v. Castleman supports its position.

Gov’t’s Notice at 1-2.

       B.     John Thomas Hines’ Second Motion

              1.     John Thomas Hines’ Position

       In his second motion, Mr. Hines presents a second ground for a new trial.

Def.’s Second Mot. at 1-4.       He maintains that a mens rea of recklessness is

insufficient to satisfy the requirements of the “use of force” under 18 U.S.C. §

921(a)(33). Id. at 3 (citing Castleman, 134 S. Ct. at (2014)).

              2.     The Government’s Response

       The Government repeats its contention that Mr. Hines waived this argument

by not raising it before trial. Gov’t’s Second Mot. at 2-4. It reiterates that the court

should make a categorical analysis of Maine’s domestic violence assault statute

rather than considering the facts of Mr. Hines’ actual crime. Id. at 4-6. Finally, the

Government argues that Castleman supports a broader reading of “violence” when

it “relates to domestic offenses.” Id. at 7.

              3.     John Thomas Hines’ Reply

       In reply, Mr. Hines cites the recent First Circuit case of United States v.

Carter, No. 12-1499, 2014 U.S. App. LEXIS 8153 (1st Cir. 2014), for the proposition

that “[t]he mere statutory reference to a conviction that might constitute a

misdemeanor crime of domestic violence is an insufficient allegation to charge Mr.

Hines committed a violation of any provision of Title 18, United States Code.” Def.’s

Second Reply at 3 (emphasis in original). He argues that this Court should apply

the “modified categorical approach” in its analysis of the Maine statute, considering



                                               7
“a limited category of sources to determine whether Mr. Hines’[] violation of § 207-A

constituted a legitimate predicate offense.” Id. Since, he argues, those sources

contain insufficient evidence of the facts underlying Mr. Hines’ conviction under

section 207-A, the indictment “fail[s] to allege an offense under the laws of the

United States. This failure is jurisdictional.” Id. at 3-4.

      Finally, Mr. Hines asks the Court to excuse any waiver under Federal Rule of

Criminal Procedure 12(b)(3) because his earlier failure to raise this issue was based

on then-current First Circuit precedent. Id. at 4.

IV.   DISCUSSION

      A.     A Preliminary Question of Waiver

      The indictment alleges that Mr. Hines,

      who had been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence,
      to wit: Domestic Violence Assault, 17-A M.R.S.A. § 207-A, Waldo
      County Superior Court (September 29, 2011), did knowingly possess in
      and affecting interstate commerce [certain firearms] . . . [i]n violation
      of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 922(g)(9) and 924(a)(2).

Indictment at 1. In its opposition, the Government maintains that under Federal

Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(e), Mr. Hines waived the right to assert that his

underlying conviction does not satisfy the definition of misdemeanor crime of

domestic violence because he failed to file a motion to dismiss the indictment under

Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(b)(3). Gov’t’s Opp’n at 2-3. Rule 12(b)(3)

recognizes two types of defects in the indictment: (1) a defect in instituting the

proceeding, FED. R. CRIM. P. 12(b)(3)(A), and (2) a defect that amounts to a failure of

the indictment to properly invoke the court’s jurisdiction or state an offense. FED.

R. CRIM. P. 12(b)(3)(B).   Under Rule 12(b)(3), a defendant may be held to have


                                               8
waived a defect in instituting the proceeding by failing to file the motion before

trial, but a defendant does not waive a claim that the Court lacked jurisdiction or

that the indictment failed to state an offense by failing to raise it before trial. See

1A CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT & ANDREW D. LEIPOLD, FEDERAL PRACTICE                       AND


PROCEDURE §§ 192-93 (4th ed. 2008 & Supp. 2014).             In fact, if the claim is

jurisdictional or alleges a failure to state an offense, Rule 12(b)(3)(B) allows a court

to consider the issue “at any time while the case is pending.” FED. RUL. CRIM. P.

12(b)(3)(B).

      The Court concludes that whether Mr. Hines’ prior misdemeanor is a

predicate crime for purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9) is not a jurisdictional question.

A violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922 is an “offense[] against the laws of the United States,”

18 U.S.C. § 3231, and falls within the jurisdiction of the Court. United States v.

Cotton, 535 U.S. 625 (2002) (stating that defects in the indictment, including the

failure to properly allege an offense, do not affect “the courts’ statutory or

constitutional power to adjudicate the case”). However, whether the sufficiency of

Mr. Hines’ predicate conviction would raise a “failure to state an offense” under

Rule 12(b)(3)(B) (not subject to waiver), or a “defect in instituting the prosecution”

(subject to waiver), is unclear—because here, unlike other potential defects, the

alleged defect is not apparent from the face of the indictment, and is an element the

Government must prove at trial. Even though he may have been able to raise the

issue before trial, the Court would not hold Mr. Hines to have waived the sufficiency

of the Government’s proof of a predicate crime if he had made a strategic decision to




                                              9
wait until trial to claim that the Government failed to prove a necessary element of

its case: namely, the sufficiency of the predicate crime.       The Court rejects the

Government’s contention that Mr. Hines waived the sufficiency of his prior

misdemeanor crime of domestic violence by failing to file a pretrial motion

challenging the sufficiency of the indictment under Rule 12(b)(3).

      B.     Timeliness of the Motion

      Mr. Hines does not mention the rule under which his motion is proceeding.

Def.’s First Mot. at 1-4; Def.’s Second Mot. at 1-4. The Court construes his motion as

either or both a post-verdict challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, FED. R.

CRIM. P. 29(c), or a motion for a new trial.       FED. R. CRIM. P. 33(a). An initial

problem with Mr. Hines’ motion, so construed, is that a motion for acquittal under

Rule 29(c) must be made within fourteen days of the judgment; likewise, a motion

for a new trial under Rule 33(b), on any ground other than newly discovered

evidence, must be made within fourteen days of the verdict. The jury issued its

guilty verdict on April 19, 2013; Mr. Hines filed his first post-conviction motion on

February 17, 2014 and his second post-conviction motion on April 8, 2014, both far

beyond the permissible fourteen day period, and there is no suggestion that either

motion is based on newly discovered evidence. The failure to file a timely challenge

to a jury verdict could constitute a waiver of the right to proceed with the challenge.

      However, under Rule 45(b), “[w]hen an act must or may be done within a

specified period, the court on its own may extend the time, or for good cause may do

so on a party’s motion made: . . . (B) after the time expires if the party failed to act

because of excusable neglect.” FED. R. CRIM. P. 45(b); see United States v. Maricle,


                                              10
No. 6: 09-16-S-DCR, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 105931, *6-7 (E.D. Ky. Oct. 4, 2010)

(“[A] significant intervening change in the law is a valid reason for delay in filing

the postverdict motions”).

      Here, Mr. Hines’ untimeliness is likely related to the Supreme Court’s

disposition of United States v. Castleman. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on

October 1, 2013 on the adequacy of a conviction for a misdemeanor crime of

domestic violence for purposes on 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9). 134 S. Ct. 49 (2013). The

Supreme Court issued its opinion in Castleman on March 26, 2014 and, although

Castleman did not assist Mr. Hines’ first motion, it included a footnote that

significantly supported his second motion.          Castleman, 134 S. Ct. at 1414 n.8.

Castleman’s clearer guidance on whether recklessness is sufficient to constitute a

“use of physical force” under § 921(a)(33)(A) justified Mr. Hines’ delay in filing his

second motion, and the Court concludes that he has demonstrated “excusable

neglect” under Rule 45(a) to justify his late post-verdict filing.

      C.     Waiver by Stipulation

      Under Rule 29, the Court may vacate a conviction and enter a judgment of

acquittal if “the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction.” FED. R. CRIM. P.

29(a). Under Rule 33, the Court may grant a new trial “if the interest of justice so

requires.” FED. R. CRIM. P. 33(a). Here, the “interest of justice” at stake is Mr.

Hines’ allegation that he was convicted of being a prohibited person in possession of

a firearm based on an invalid predicate offense—his guilty plea to domestic violence

assault under the Maine statute. Likewise, the evidence used to convict Mr. Hines

would be insufficient under Rule 29 if the Court were to (1) relieve Mr. Hines of his


                                               11
stipulation that he was a prohibited person by virtue of his domestic violence

assault conviction, and (2) conclude that Maine’s domestic violence assault statute

is not a valid predicate offense to 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9).

      “Stipulations between parties are not ‘absolute,’ . . . and a party may be

relieved of a stipulation for good cause-which means, in a nutshell, that good reason

must exist and that relief must not unfairly prejudice the opposing party or the

interests of justice.” Am. Honda Motor Co., Inc. v. Richard Lundgren, Inc., 314 F.3d

17, 21 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting T I Fed. Credit Union v. DelBonis, 72 F.3d 921, 928

(1st Cir. 1995)). In other words, “[f]or good cause, the district court can relieve a

defendant of such a waiver—just as it can relieve parties from a stipulation or

refuse to honor a plea agreement’s waiver of the right to appeal when the waiver

would effect a ‘miscarriage of justice.’” United States v. Newbert, 504 F.3d 180, 189

(1st Cir. 2007). In this case, there would be good cause to relieve Mr. Hines of his

stipulation if the stipulation were contrary to law; that is, if Mr. Hines’ state court

conviction did not render him a prohibited person and he is therefore actually

innocent of the federal crime of which he was convicted. In sum, the analysis under

Rule 29, Rule 33, and Newbert boils down to the same question: whether domestic

violence assault under 17-A M.R.S. § 207-A is a valid predicate offense to 18 U.S.C.

§ 922(g)(9).

      D.       First Circuit Law Before United States v. Castleman

      Before Castleman, the First Circuit had previously considered and rejected

the very same arguments that Mr. Hines is raising here. Armstrong I, 706 F.3d 1,

vacated and remanded, No. 12-10209, 82 U.S.L.W. 3566 (Mar. 31, 2014); United


                                              12
States v. Booker, 644 F.3d 12 (1st Cir. 2011); United States v. Nason, 269 F.3d 10

(1st Cir. 2001). As to his first argument—that “offensive touching” cannot be a “use

of physical force”—Mr. Hines concedes as much. Def.’s Mot. at 1 n.1 (“Defendant is

aware that current First Circuit precedent forecloses this argument”).

      As to the second argument, before the Supreme Court issued Castleman on

March 26, 2014, the First Circuit had concluded that a crime based on reckless

conduct could satisfy the “use of physical force” requirement in § 921(a)(33)(A),

ruling against the argument Mr. Hines has raised in his second motion. Booker,

644 F.3d at 19-20.

      E.     Castleman

      After the parties briefed Mr. Hines’ first motion and the Court took it under

advisement, the United States Supreme Court decided Castleman, 134 S. Ct. 1405.

After Castleman, the Supreme Court also vacated the First Circuit’s decision in

Armstrong and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in

light of Castleman. Armstrong v. United States, 82 U.S.L.W. 3566 (Mar. 31, 2014)

(Armstrong II). The question is how Castleman affects the resolution of the issues

Mr. Hines has raised.

      In Castleman, the Supreme Court considered whether a defendant,

previously convicted under a Tennessee domestic violence statute that forbade

“intentionally or knowingly caus[ing] bodily injury to” a domestic partner, had

committed a misdemeanor that included “the use . . . of physical force” for the




                                            13
purpose of 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(33)(A).1              Castleman, 134 S. Ct. at 1409.               The

defendant argued to the district court that the indictment was facially defective

because the Tennessee statute did not “‘ha[ve], as an element, the use . . . of

physical force.’” Id. at 1409 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 922(a)(33)(A)(ii)) (alteration in

original). The district court agreed, holding that the Tennessee statute was not a

valid predicate “because one can cause bodily injury without violent contact—for

example, by deceiving the victim into drinking a poisoned beverage.” Id. (internal

quotations and alterations omitted). A divided panel of the Sixth Circuit affirmed,

reasoning that § 921(a)(33)(A) requires “violent force,” and that “Castleman could

have been convicted for ‘caus[ing] a slight, nonserious physical injury with conduct

that cannot be described as violent.’”            Id. at 1409-10 (quoting United States v.

Castleman, 695 F.3d 582, 590 (6th Cir. 2012)).

        The Supreme Court reversed both the Court of Appeals and the district court.

The Castleman Court observed that “at common law, the element of force in the

crime of battery was ‘satisfied by even the slightest offensive touching.’” Id. at 1410

(quoting Johnson v. United States, 559 U.S. 133, 139 (2010)). The Supreme Court

1       Title 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(33)(A) defines “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence” for the
purpose of § 922(g)(9). Under this definition, a “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence” is an
offense that

        (i) is a misdemeanor under Federal, State, or Tribal law; and

        (ii) has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened
        use of a deadly weapon, committed by a current or former spouse, parent, or
        guardian of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common,
        by a person who is cohabiting with or has cohabited with the victim as a spouse,
        parent, or guardian, or by a person similarly situated to a spouse, parent, or
        guardian of the victim

Id. § 921(a)(33)(A).




                                                     14
further reasoned that “‘a common-law term of art should be given its established

common-law meaning,’ except ‘where that meaning does not fit.’”          Id. (quoting

Johnson, 559 U.S. at 139). After detailed analysis, the Court expressly held that

“the requirement of ‘physical force’ is satisfied, for purposes of § 922(g)(9), by the

degree of force that supports a common-law battery conviction,” which the Court

had previously described as being “satisfied by the slightest offensive touching.” Id.

at 1410, 1413.   The Castleman Court doomed Mr. Hines’ first motion.

      The Castleman Court next analyzed Tennessee’s statute under which the

defendant was convicted to determine “whether that conviction necessarily ‘ha[d],

as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a

deadly weapon.’” Id. at 1413 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(33)(A)). The Court first

applied the “categorical approach” defined in Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575

(1990). Id. The Tennessee statute criminalized three sets of behavior together:

causing bodily injury, causing physical contact, and causing “another to reasonably

fear imminent bodily injury.” Id. The Castleman Court observed that “not . . .

every type of assault defined by [the statute] necessarily involves ‘the use or

attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon.’” Id.

(quoting 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(33)(A)). However, both parties had agreed that the

Tennessee statute was “divisible” under Descamps v. United States, 570 U.S.__, 133

S. Ct. 2276 (2013), allowing the Court to use the “modified categorical approach”

and to examine the indictment to which Castleman pleaded guilty to determine

whether his crime involved the use of force. Id. at 437-38. Because he pleaded




                                             15
guilty to “intentionally or knowingly caus[ing] bodily injury” to a domestic partner,

the Court concluded that the conviction “qualifies as a ‘misdemeanor crime of

domestic violence.’” Id. at 1415.

      Significantly, however, the Castleman Court footnoted an important

discussion about whether a state domestic assault statute, which criminalized

reckless conduct, would meet the “use of physical force” standard under §

921(a)(33)(A):

      We held in Leocal [v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. 1 (2004)] that “‘use’ requires
      active employment,” rather “than negligent or merely accidental
      conduct.” 543 U.S. at 9. Although Leocal reserved the question
      whether reckless application of force could constitute a “use” of force,
      id. at 13, the Courts of Appeals have almost uniformly held that
      recklessness is not sufficient. [Citations followed to cases from ten
      circuit courts of appeal.] But see United States v. Booker, 644 F.3d 12,
      19-20 (C.A.1 2011) (noting that the First Circuit had not resolved the
      recklessness issue under Leocal, but declining to extend Leocal’s
      analysis to § 922(g)(9)).

Castleman, 134 S. Ct. at 1414 n.8. This footnote, which cited ten circuit courts as

concluding that reckless conduct did not constitute “use of physical force,” strongly

hinted that the First Circuit’s Booker decision was an outlier.

      F.     The Supreme Court and the First Circuit After Castleman

      Tagging along behind Castleman were two cases: Carter, 2014 U.S. App.

LEXIS 8153, and Armstrong I, 706 F.3d 1.           The First Circuit had ruled in

Armstrong that a violation of the Maine domestic assault statute, which

criminalizes “intentionally, knowingly or recklessly caus[ing] bodily injury or

offensive physical contact,” 17-A M.R.S. § 207-A(1)(A), could be a predicate offense

for § 922(g)(9). The defendant in Armstrong filed for a writ of certiorari and, after



                                             16
Castleman, the Supreme Court vacated the Armstrong I judgment and remanded

the case to the First Circuit “for further consideration in light of United States v.

Castleman.” Armstrong II, 82 U.S.L.W. 3566. Reading Supreme Court tea leaves is

chancy, but the First Circuit decision in Armstrong I was consistent with Castleman

except for the Circuit Court’s brief recklessness analysis. It is a short logical step to

conclude that the reason the Supreme Court vacated the First Circuit decision in

Armstrong I was to pull the First Circuit in line with the other ten circuit courts in

the recklessness analysis.

      With Armstrong II coming back down from the Supreme Court, another case

that involved the same issue, United States v. Carter, was coming up from the

district court. On April 30, 2014, the First Circuit issued an opinion in Carter and

quickly expressed serious doubt in the viability of Booker’s holding that merely

reckless conduct can be a “use of physical force.” Carter, 2014 U.S. App. LEXIS

8153, at *26-28.

      The Supreme Court’s statements in Castleman—that “the merely
      reckless causation of bodily injury ... may not be a ‘use’ of force,” . . .
      and that “the Courts of Appeals have almost uniformly held that
      recklessness is not sufficient” to “constitute a ‘use’ of force,” . . . —
      provide a “‘sound reason’” for thinking that the Booker panel might
      well “‘change its collective mind’” in light of Castleman.

Id. at *28 n.11 (quoting Castleman, 134 S. Ct. at 1414 & n.8 and United States v.

Rodriguez-Pacheco, 475 F.3d 434, 442 (1st Cir. 2007)). However, the Carter Court

declined to expressly overrule Booker; instead, the Circuit Court remanded the case

to the district court to attempt to make findings of fact on the particulars of the

crime underlying the defendant’s guilty plea using “Shepard documents.” Id. at *34



                                              17
(citing Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 26 (2005) and Taylor v. United States,

495 U.S. 575, 602 (1990)).

      This Court takes its lead from Carter. First, based on Castleman, Armstrong

and Carter, the Court concludes that it is so questionable whether a conviction for

domestic assault under 17-A M.R.S. § 207-A(1)(A)—without more—may operate as

predicate conviction under § 922(g)(9), that this Court must grant Mr. Hines a new

trial. Next, the First Circuit in Carter has held that the Maine domestic assault

statute, 17-A M.R.S. § 207-A(1)(A), is a divisible statute. Carter, 2014 U.S. App.

LEXIS 8153, at *25 (“Therefore, the Maine statute is divisible”). This means that

the Court must employ the “modified categorical approach” described in Shepard

and Taylor. Id. (“[W]e may accordingly apply the modified categorical approach”).

The First Circuit remanded the Carter case to the district court to determine

whether, using the modified categorical approach, the defendant’s conviction should

be deemed a § 922(g)(9) predicate. Id. at *30-34. Thus, like the First Circuit in

Carter, this Court will allow the Government to determine whether it wishes to

proceed with the prosecution of this offense, based on whatever Shepard documents

it is able to gather from the state proceedings.

      Here, the parties placed some Shepard documents before the Court in the

pending motions; however, the memoranda were filed before the First Circuit issued

Carter. To give the Government a fair opportunity to decide whether to proceed

forward, the Court will grant the motion for a new trial but not the motion to

dismiss the indictment. Nevertheless, as this prosecution has been pending since




                                              18
December 13, 2012, and as Mr. Hines is currently incarcerated, the Court is

sensitive to the impact of this ongoing charge on Mr. Hines.2 The Court will set this

case for a conference of counsel within the next two weeks at which time the Court

will expect the Government to inform the Court whether it wishes to proceed with

the prosecution and, if so, will expect the parties to propose a course of action for the

final disposition of the charge.3

       G.     The Pro Se Motion to Vacate and Dismiss

       When a defendant is represented by counsel, the Court does not typically rule

on pro se motions unless counsel adopts them.               Here, Attorney Foote has not

indicated that he adopts Mr. Hines’ Motion to Vacate and Dismiss. At any rate, the

pro se motion is moot in light of the Court’s disposition of Attorney Foote’s motion.

V.     CONCLUSION

       The Court GRANTS IN PART the Defendant’s Motion to Vacate and Dismiss

(ECF Nos. 96, 109), VACATES John Thomas Hines’ conviction (ECF No. 68), and

GRANTS his Motion for New Trial (ECF No. 96).

       SO ORDERED.

Dated this 9th day of May, 2014

2      Mr. Hines voluntarily surrendered his bail on July 17, 2013. Order and Waiver of Hr’g (ECF
No. 76). In light of this Order, the Court urges counsel to consult with each other and discuss
whether he should continue to be incarcerated.
3      Mr. Hines’ case is scheduled for sentencing on May 19, 2014. In light of this opinion, the
Court continues the sentencing hearing.
