                            MEMORANDUM & ORDER
I.   INTRODUCTION

     Benito Rivera (“Rivera”) moves to vacate his September 2017

felon-in-possession conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1)

pursuant to Rehaif v. United States, 139 S. Ct. 2191 (2019), in

which the Supreme Court held that to support a section 922(g)(1)

verdict, the government must prove that while in possession of a

firearm, the defendant knew that he or she belonged to a

category of persons statutorily prohibited from carrying the

firearm.   Rivera’s motion is DENIED.

     In 1994, Rivera was found guilty at trial of trafficking

heroin and received a sentence of ten years to ten years and one

day in state prison.      Mot. Vacate Conviction 28 U.S.C. § 2255 &

Rehaif v. United States, 139 S. Ct. 2191 (2019) (“Mot. Vacate”)

3, ECF No. 110.       In 2001, Rivera pled guilty to possession of a

Class B Substance with intent to distribute and received a


                                      [1]
     Case 1:16-cr-10306-WGY Document 128 Filed 11/04/21 Page 2 of 12



sentence of three years to three years and a day in state

prison.   Id.   In May 2009, Rivera pled guilty to two counts of

armed robbery and was sentenced to five to ten years in state

prison.   Id.   Following the armed robbery conviction, Rivera was

indicted in this Court in 2016 on a single count of being a

felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition in violation of

18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).    Id.    Rivera went to trial and was

convicted on September 14, 2017.        Id.   At trial, the Court

presented the jury with the question “Did Mr. Rivera, as the law

requires, did he possess that firearm and ammunition?” and

instructed the jury that Rivera would be found guilty only if he

“knowingly possessed it.”     Tr. Jury Trial 67-68, ECF No. 95

(“[I]f it is proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he had that

firearm in that bag or on his person somewhere and he had it --

now he has to know he’s got a firearm, he’s got know [sic] he’s

carrying it . . . .”).    During the trial, there was no reference

of any kind to Rivera’s knowledge of being a felon at the time

of the firearm possession.      Id.

     About two years later, on June 21, 2019, the Supreme Court

held in Rehaif that to convict a defendant under 18 U.S.C.

§ 922(g), “the Government . . . must show that the defendant

knew he possessed a firearm and also that he knew he had the

relevant status when he possessed it.”         139 S. Ct. at 2194

(emphasis added).    Following the Rehaif decision, on June 19,


                                      [2]
     Case 1:16-cr-10306-WGY Document 128 Filed 11/04/21 Page 3 of 12



2020, Rivera moved to vacate his conviction pursuant to 28

U.S.C. § 2255.   See generally Mot. Vacate.      In his motion,

Rivera argues that his conviction must be vacated because the

jury was not instructed to consider whether Rivera knew that he

was a felon at the time of the armed robbery.        Id. 4.

     Section 922(g) of title 18 of the United States Code

provides that “[i]t shall be unlawful” for certain individuals

to possess firearms.    18 U.S.C. § 922(g).     The provision then

lists nine categories of individuals subject to the prohibition,

including felons.    Id. § 922(g)(1).    A separate sub-section,

§ 924(a)(2), adds that anyone who “knowingly violates”

section 922(g) shall be fined or imprisoned for up to ten years.

Id. § 924(a)(2).    The Supreme Court in Rehaif held that “in a

prosecution under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) and § 924(a)(2), the

Government must prove both that the defendant knew he possessed

a firearm and that he knew he belonged to the relevant category

of persons barred from possessing a firearm.”        139 S. Ct. at

2200 (emphasis added).

     In reliance upon the Rehaif decision, Rivera claims that

(1) since the essential element of knowing that he was a felon

was neither alleged in the indictment nor discussed at any

proceeding in his case, this Court did not have jurisdiction to

enter judgment against him, Mot. Vacate 5-6, and (2) the




                                  [3]
      Case 1:16-cr-10306-WGY Document 128 Filed 11/04/21 Page 4 of 12



indictment violated Rivera’s Fifth Amendment right to be charged

by a grand jury and Sixth Amendment right to notice, id. 8.

II.   THE COLLATERAL ATTACK -- HABEAS REVIEW

      Under 28 U.S.C. § 2255(a),

      A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court
      established by Act of Congress claiming the right to be
      released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed
      in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United
      States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to
      impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess
      of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject
      to collateral attack, may move the court which imposed
      the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the
      sentence.

28 U.S.C. § 2255(a).     A prisoner seeking relief under 28

U.S.C. § 2255 must allege either: (1) an error of

constitutional magnitude; (2) a sentence imposed outside

the statutory limits; or (3) an error of fact or law that

was so fundamental as to render the entire proceeding

invalid.    Short v. United States, 471 F.3d 686, 691 (2006)

(citation and quotations omitted).

      A habeas petition, however, does not replace a direct

appeal.    As a general rule, “claims not raised on direct

appeal may not be raised on collateral review . . . .”

Massaro v. United States, 538 U.S. 500, 504 (2003).          “Where

a defendant has procedurally defaulted a claim by failing

to raise it on direct review, the claim may be raised in

habeas only if the defendant can first demonstrate either



                                   [4]
     Case 1:16-cr-10306-WGY Document 128 Filed 11/04/21 Page 5 of 12



‘cause’ and actual ‘prejudice,’ or that he is ‘actually

innocent.’”   Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 622

(1998) (citations omitted).

     Here, Rivera has failed to show cause or prejudice for

his failure to raise this claim on direct appeal, and he

does not attempt to show that he is actually innocent.         See

generally Mot. Vacate.    Thus, his claim is procedurally

defaulted.

     First, as to cause, although a claim that “is so novel

that its legal basis is not reasonably available to

counsel” may constitute cause for a procedural default,

Bousley, 523 U.S. at 622, Rivera’s claim does not qualify.

A petitioner cannot establish that a claim was “not

reasonably available to counsel” just because of the

perception that “a claim was unacceptable to that

particular court at that particular time.”       Id. at 622-23.

     The Supreme Court had emphasized the importance of

scienter in distinguishing between wrongful and innocent

conduct in many cases prior to Rehaif.       See, e.g.,

Liparota v. United States, 471 U.S. 419, 425 (1985); United

States v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394, 406 (1980); United States

v. U.S. Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 436 (1978); Morissette v.

United States, 342 U.S. 246, 250–51 (1952).        Additionally,

well before Rehaif was decided, the Supreme Court had


                                  [5]
     Case 1:16-cr-10306-WGY Document 128 Filed 11/04/21 Page 6 of 12



interpreted statutes to include a scienter requirement even

where the statutory text was silent on the question.         See,

e.g., Staples v. United States, 511 U.S. 600, 610 (1994).

Rivera has not attempted to show cause for his procedural

default, but even if he had, based on the aforementioned

legal standards, Rivera would not be able to argue

convincingly that the legal basis for Rehaif was not

reasonably available to him at the time of his appeal.

     Second, as to actual prejudice, a petitioner can

establish the required prejudice by showing “a reasonable

probability that, but for the errors, the result of the

proceeding would have been different.”       Lee v. United

States, 137 S. Ct. 1958, 1964-65 (2017). 1      A petitioner

“must shoulder the burden of showing, not merely that the

errors at his trial created a possibility of prejudice, but

that they worked to his actual and substantial

disadvantage, infecting his entire trial with error of

constitutional dimensions.”     United States v. Frady, 456




     1 Lee refers to prejudice in the context of an ineffective
assistance of counsel claim, not in the context of procedural
default, but the First Circuit has ruled that there is no
practical difference between the two. See Lynch v. Ficco, 438
F.3d 35, 49 (1st Cir. 2006) (“[I]n this circuit, we have held
that . . . if a habeas petitioner can meet the prejudice
standard needed to establish ineffective assistance . . . then
the prejudice standard under the ‘cause and prejudice’ showing
to excuse a procedural default is also met.”).


                                  [6]
      Case 1:16-cr-10306-WGY Document 128 Filed 11/04/21 Page 7 of 12



U.S. 152, 170 (1982).     The Supreme Court has summarized the

degree of prejudice that a prisoner is required to show

before obtaining a collateral relief for error in the jury

charge as “whether the ailing instruction by itself so

infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction

violates due process, not merely whether the instruction is

undesirable, erroneous, or even universally condemned.”

Henderson v. Kibbe, 431 U.S. 145, 154 (1977) (citations and

quotations omitted).

      Here, Rivera argues that he has been prejudiced

because “[e]ven if instructed correctly under Rehaif, a

jury could not have found Rivera guilty because no evidence

of knowledge of status appears in the record.”         Mot. Vacate

13.   The Court disagrees.     Rivera’s record shows at least

three separate occasions prior to the instant offense where

he was sentenced to and served more than one year of

imprisonment.    Id. 3.   This, by itself, supports the

conclusion that Rivera had knowledge of his status as a

convicted felon when he was on trial for firearm possession

pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 922(g).       See Greer v. United

States, 141 S. Ct. 2090, 2097 (2021) (“If a person is a

felon, he ordinarily knows he is a felon.        Felony status is

simply not the kind of thing that one forgets.” (quotations

omitted)).


                                   [7]
     Case 1:16-cr-10306-WGY Document 128 Filed 11/04/21 Page 8 of 12



     Therefore, the Court rules that Rivera has failed to

show cause or actual prejudice for his procedural default.

     The only path left for Rivera is showing actual

innocence.   “[P]risoners asserting innocence as a gateway

to defaulted claims must establish that, in light of new

evidence, it is more likely than not that no reasonable

juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a

reasonable doubt.”   House v. Bell, 547 U.S. 518, 536–37

(2006) (quotations omitted) (citing Schlup v. Delo, 513

U.S. 298, 327 (1995)).    In this regard, the Supreme Court

has noted that actual innocence means “factual innocence,

not mere legal insufficiency.”     Bousley, 523 U.S. at 623.

The actual innocence standard may be met in “in an

extraordinary case, where a constitutional violation has

probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually

innocent.”   Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 496 (1986).

Rivera has not attempted to meet this standard.        See

generally Mot. Vacate.    Rivera has a record of three

sentences of more than one year each.       Mot. Vacate 3.     Like

the actual-prejudice prong, this record supports a

conclusion that Rivera was aware of his status as a

convicted felon while later possessing a firearm.        See

Greer, 141 S. Ct. at 2097.     The Court is convinced that no

reasonable juror could have believed that Rivera did not


                                  [8]
     Case 1:16-cr-10306-WGY Document 128 Filed 11/04/21 Page 9 of 12



know that he had been convicted of a crime punishable by

imprisonment for a term exceeding one year when Rivera had

previously served many years in prison for many crimes.

Thus, the Court rules that Rivera has failed to show actual

innocence, and accordingly his motion to vacate is

procedurally barred.

III. THE MERITS

     Even were the Court to address the merits, Rivera would

fare no better.

     A.   Jurisdictional Challenge

     Rivera’s first argument is that the missing scienter-

of-status requirement in his trial renders the entire

indictment defective such that this Court lacked

jurisdiction to enter judgment against him in the 18 U.S.C.

§ 922(g) prosecution.    Mot. Vacate 2.     The Court disagrees.

The Supreme Court has ruled that “defects in an indictment

do not deprive a court of its power to adjudicate a case.”

United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625, 630 (2002).

Accordingly, with regards to Rehaif, the First Circuit has

decided that “the government’s failure to allege the

scienter-of-status element in the indictment did not

deprive the district court of jurisdiction.”        United States

v. Farmer, 988 F.9d 55, 60-61 (1st Cir. 2021); accord

United States v. Hobbs, 953 F.3d 853, 856-57 (6th Cir.


                                  [9]
     Case 1:16-cr-10306-WGY Document 128 Filed 11/04/21 Page 10 of 12



2021).     Therefore, the Court rules that it did not lack

jurisdiction to enter judgment against Rivera in the 18

U.S.C. § 922(g) prosecution.

      B.     Constitutional Challenge

      Lastly, Rivera argues that the defective indictment

violated his Fifth Amendment right to be charged by a grand

jury and his Sixth Amendment right to notice.        Mot. Vacate

2.   Specifically, he claims that “[n]o evidence of Rivera’s

knowledge of his status as a person prohibited from

possessing a firearm was introduced at trial and the jury

was not instructed that such knowledge of status was an

element of the offense.     Accordingly, Rivera’s Fifth and

Sixth Amendment rights were violated.”       Id.

      “The First Circuit applies the plain error standard to

clear or obvious errors (including structural errors) that

were not raised before the district court, such as Fifth

and Sixth Amendment challenges.”      United States v.

Guardado, CIVIL ACTION NO. 12-cr-40004-TSH, 2021 WL

3055015, at *3 (D. Mass. July 20, 2021) (Hillman, J.)

(citing United States v. Lara, 970 F.3d 68, 86 (1st Cir.

2020) (“The plain error standard of review applies,

however, even to challenges to structural errors if they

were not raised below.”)).     To meet the plain error

standard, a petitioner must show three elements: (1) “there


                                  [10]
    Case 1:16-cr-10306-WGY Document 128 Filed 11/04/21 Page 11 of 12



must be an error that has not been intentionally

relinquished or abandoned”; (2) “the error must be plain --

that is to say, clear or obvious”; and (3) “the error must

have affected the defendant’s substantial rights . . . .”

Molina-Martinez v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 1338, 1343

(2016).   To meet the third element, a petitioner “must show

a reasonable probability that, but for the error, the

outcome of the proceeding would have been different.”         Id.

(citation and quotations omitted).

     In United States v. Burghardt, a post-Rehaif decision,

the First Circuit denied a motion to vacate a

section 922(g)(1) conviction because the record revealed

“no reason to think that the government would have had any

difficulty at all in offering overwhelming proof that

Burghardt knew that he had previously been convicted of

offenses punishable by more than a year in prison.”        See

939 F.3d 397, 404 (1st Cir. 2019).      Specifically, the First

Circuit noted that

     according to his presentence investigation report (PSR),
     Burghardt received 2-10 years in state prison for two of
     the sale convictions, 7.5-15 years in state prison for
     the third sale conviction and the possession-with-
     intent-to-sell conviction, and 2-5 years in state prison
     for the robbery conviction. If true, the receipt of such
     sentences would certainly have made clear to Burghardt
     the fact that his offenses were punishable by more than
     a year in prison.

Id. (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).


                                 [11]
      Case 1:16-cr-10306-WGY Document 128 Filed 11/04/21 Page 12 of 12



      The reasoning in Burghardt is applicable to Rivera’s

case.     As described above, Rivera was sentenced on three

different occasions to serve more than one year in prison.

Therefore, the Court finds that it is more likely than not

that had the Court instructed the jury on the scienter-of-

status element, the outcome of the proceeding would not

have been different.     The Court rules that regardless

whether there was an error and whether this error was clear

or obvious -- the missing scienter element did not affect

Rivera’s substantial rights.

IV.   CONCLUSION

      For the foregoing reasons, Rivera’s motion to vacate, ECF

No. 110, is DENIED.



SO ORDERED.
