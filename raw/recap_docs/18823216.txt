                                         ORDER

       Having considered the Report and Recommendation filed on November 27, 2012
(docket entry 28) on a Rule 11 proceeding of defendant Moisés Cabrera-Rodríguez held
before U.S. Magistrate Judge Silvia Carreño-Coll on November 16, 2012, to which no
objection has been filed, the same is APPROVED. Accordingly, the plea of guilty of
defendant is accepted. The Court FINDS that his plea was voluntary and intelligently
entered with awareness of his rights and the consequences of pleading guilty and contains
all elements of the offense charged in the indictment. The Court, however, will defer its
decision on whether to accept the parties’ Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C) Plea Agreement until
it reviews the Pre-Sentence Report, pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(3)(A).
       This case was referred to the U.S. Probation Office for preparation of a Presentence
Investigation Report since November 16, 2012. The sentencing hearing is set for
February 21, 2013 at 4:30 PM.
       SO ORDERED.
       At San Juan, Puerto Rico, on December 26, 2012.
