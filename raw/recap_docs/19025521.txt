                                   ORDER

     Re: Document No. 10, Motion to vacate sealed order and for
release of defendant

     Ruling: I remand the matter to the Magistrate Judge for a
determination as to whether any representations in the motion would
cause him to reconsider his decision. In remanding the matter, I do
not mean to suggest that prior order should be revised. Instead, I
intend merely to give the Magistrate Judge the opportunity to
determine whether any of the new information included in the motion
would affect his ruling.
