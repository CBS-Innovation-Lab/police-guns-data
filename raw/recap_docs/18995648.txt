                 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                       DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

            v.                           Criminal No. 11-cr-89-01-JD

Richard E. Parks

                                 O R D E R


       The assented to motion to reschedule jury trial (document no.

17) filed by defendant is granted.      Government shall promptly decide

if additional charges are going to be brought in this matter so that

this case can move forward to trial or other resolution. Trial is

continued to the two-week period beginning February 22, 2012, 9:30

a.m.

       Defendant shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights within 10

days.    The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting

a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ' 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv), for the

reasons set forth in the motion.

       SO ORDERED.



                                         /s/ Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr.
