                    GOVERNMENT’S SENTENCING MEMORANDUM

        The United States of America, by and through the United States Attorney for the District

of Massachusetts and undersigned Assistant United States Attorney, in accordance with the United

States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual (hereinafter, “the Guidelines” or simply,

“U.S.S.G.”), hereby submits this Memorandum in support of its position on sentencing. Based

upon the Defendant’s Guidelines sentencing range, the statutory sentencing factors set forth in 18

U.S.C. § 3553, the plea agreement entered into by the parties (D.E. 49), and for the reasons set

forth in the government’s motion for a downward departure (D.E. 95), the government

recommends that Defendant be sentenced to 7 months imprisonment, 24 months of supervised

release, and a mandatory special assessment of $100.        This sentence requires a downward

departure from Defendant’s applicable Guidelines sentencing range, and is “sufficient, but not

greater than necessary” to achieve the goals of sentencing. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).

   I.      FACTUAL SUMMARY

        In June 2019, a source of information for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and

Explosives (“ATF”) advised investigators that Defendant was offering firearms for sale in the

District of Massachusetts. The source produced messages from Defendant on Facebook in which


                                                1
         Case 1:19-cr-10261-NMG Document 97 Filed 04/29/22 Page 2 of 11




Defendant offered firearms for sale, including photographs of firearms. Shortly thereafter, ATF

investigators arranged for a controlled purchase of firearms between an undercover officer and

Defendant.     The details of the illegal transaction were negotiated by electronic and voice

communication. See Presentence Investigation Report (“PSR”), revised September 8, 2020, at

¶ 10.   Defendant and the undercover officer had never met prior to negotiating the illicit

transaction.

        Defendant illegally sold the undercover officer two handguns and ammunition on June 27,

2019, at Defendant’s residence in Brockton, Massachusetts, for $2,200 U.S. currency. See PSR

at ¶ 10. One handgun was a Taurus G2c 9mm Luger caliber pistol, the second handgun was Glock

9mm Luger caliber pistol, and the ammunition was 21 rounds of 9mm Luger caliber ammunition.

Id. Defendant never asked the undercover officer for any identifying information or checked

whether the undercover officer was duly licensed to possess the firearms or had any criminal

convictions that disqualified them for lawfully possessing the firearms. See PSR at ¶ 9.

        Defendant was arrested the following day, June 28, 2019, with $1,700 of the U.S. currency

from the illegal firearms transaction in his pocket. Investigators traced the firearms Defendant

sold to the undercover officer to a straw purchaser in Georgia and a firearms trafficker with whom

the straw purchaser was working, Richard Philippe (“Philippe”). See PSR at ¶¶ 8, 10. Between

April 2019 and June 2019, Philippe likely trafficked in excess of 100 firearms from Georgia into

Massachusetts, with the intention of illegally selling those firearms out of warehouse space he

controlled in Taunton. Id. Philippe was Defendant’s source of firearms. Id. Philippe was

arrested several days after Defendant.

        Defendant purchased approximately 14 firearms from Philippe at the Taunton warehouse.


                                                2
          Case 1:19-cr-10261-NMG Document 97 Filed 04/29/22 Page 3 of 11




See PSR at ¶ 11; but see Section III, a. (Guidelines Calculations), infra. Defendant knew Philippe

only as “Rich,” and met him at the Taunton warehouse on approximately eight occasions to

negotiate the purchase of firearms. Defendant attempted to re-sell the firearms he purchased from

Philippe for profit primarily through social media. See PSR at ¶ 15. Defendant also attempted

to broker sales of firearms still in the possession of Philippe and others by posting photographs of

the firearms on social media and advertising them for sale.

   II.      PROCEDURAL HISTORY

         Defendant was arrested on June 28, 2019, on a criminal complaint. He made his initial

appearance in federal court on July 1, 2019. On July 25, 2019, a grand jury seated in Boston

returned the Indictment charging Defendant with one count of being a Felon in Possession of a

Firearm, specifically the Taurus G2c 9mm pistol and the Glock 9mm pistol he sold to the ATF

undercover officer, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). On February 25, 2020, Defendant pled

guilty to the single count charged in the Indictment, pursuant to a plea agreement with the

government. See PSR at ¶ 2. The plea agreement between parties pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P.

11(c)(1)(B), was filed the next day, February 26, 2020. See D.E. 49. The Court has ordered

Defendant’s sentencing be continued at the request of both parties at least five times, pending the

outcome of related litigation. See Orders Allowing Motions to Continue, D.E. 58, 66, 68, 81, 91.

         Defendant was initially ordered detained pending trial following his initial appearance.

See Order of Detention Pending Trial, July 3, 2019, D.E. 13. Detention was based, in part, on the

apparent significance of Defendant’s criminal history, which includes multiple felony convictions

for controlled substance offense. Id. Further investigation of the facts underlying Defendant’s

prior convictions confirmed that Defendant would not be subject to enhanced penalties based upon


                                                 3
           Case 1:19-cr-10261-NMG Document 97 Filed 04/29/22 Page 4 of 11




his criminal history. Specifically, because of the way the Guidelines defines a “prior sentence,”

Defendant did not sustain at least two prior felony convictions of a controlled substance offense

for the purpose of computing his criminal history score. See U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(a)(2); PSR at

¶ 33. A further hearing was held by the magistrate judge on the issue of Defendant’s detention

on September 4, 2019, and Defendant was released on conditions over the government’s objection.

Defendant served approximately 2 months and 13 days in custody prior to his release on

conditions.

   III.       DETERMINING THE SENTENCE

              a. Guidelines Calculations

          While the Guidelines are advisory and not mandatory, United States v. Booker, 543 U.S.

220 (2005), the First Circuit has made clear that “the guidelines still play an important role in the

sentencing procedure, so that [ ] a court should ordinarily begin by calculating the applicable

guideline range.” United States v. Gilman, 478 F.3d 440, 445 (1st Cir. 2007); see Gall v. United

States, 552 U.S. 38, 49 (2007) (“As a matter of administration and to secure nationwide

consistency, the Sentencing Guidelines should be the starting point and the initial benchmark.”).

Probation determined that Defendant’s total offense level is 13, based upon: i.) a base offense level

of 14 because Defendant was a prohibited person; ii.) a two-level enhancement because the offense

involved between three and seven firearms; and iii.) a three-level reduction for acceptance of

responsibility. PSR at ¶¶ 17-27. Probation assigned Defendant criminal history category III and

concluded that his Guidelines sentencing range was 18 months to 24 months imprisonment.

          The government agrees that Probation’s calculations are accurate based on the information

it possessed at the time of its investigation in 2020; however, that information is now incomplete

in one material respect. Subsequent to Probation’s investigation, Defendant provided sworn
                                            4
        Case 1:19-cr-10261-NMG Document 97 Filed 04/29/22 Page 5 of 11




testimony in related litigation concerning the number of firearms he possessed. See Exhibit 1,

Transcript, December 16, 2021. Defendant testified that he purchased “around 14.” Id. at 5:25-

6:4. Accordingly, the offense level computation should include a four-level enhancement for the

number of firearms involved in the offense, not the two-level enhancement Probation applied.

U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(1). The new total offense level is 15. Based on Probation’s scoring of

Defendant’s criminal history and assignment of criminal history category III, Defendant’s

Guidelines sentencing range is 24 months to 30 months imprisonment.

           b. The Plea Agreement

       As pertinent here, the plea agreement in this case provides that Defendant enter a plea of

guilty pursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and the

government agree to recommend the following sentence to the Court:

           a) Incarceration for a term not to exceed the low end of the Guidelines sentencing
              range resulting from the offense level as calculated by the parties in Paragraph 3
              and the criminal history category as calculated by the Court at sentencing;

           b) 24 months of supervised release;

           c) a mandatory special assessment of $100, which Defendant must pay to the Clerk of
              the Court by the date of sentencing; and

           d) forfeiture as set forth in Paragraph 6 [of the plea agreement].
The plea agreement stipulated a total offense level of 23. For the reasons set forth herein, the

government now believes that Defendant’s actual total offense level is 15.

           c. Application of the Section 3553(a) Factors

       Under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), “[t]he Court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater

than necessary, to comply with the purposes” of sentencing. The purposes of sentencing are:

       (A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to
       provide just punishment for the offense; (B) to afford adequate deterrence to
                                                 5
         Case 1:19-cr-10261-NMG Document 97 Filed 04/29/22 Page 6 of 11




       criminal conduct; (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant;
       and (D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training,
       medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner.

18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2).

       The Court should consider all of the Section 3553(a) sentencing factors and undertake “an

individual assessment based on the facts presented.” Gall, 552 U.S. at 49. “A sentencing court

does not enjoy the benefit of a legal presumption that the Guidelines sentence should apply.” Rita

v. United States, 551 U.S. 338, 351 (2007), and it “may not presume that the Guidelines range is

reasonable,” Gall, 552 U.S. at 50; see Nelson v. United States, 555 U.S. 350 (2009). In this case,

examination of these factors demonstrates that imposing a Guidelines sentence with the requested

downward departure is reasonable; however, the Section 3553(a) factors are not relevant to

the Court’s determination of the extent of the downward departure. See Gall, 552 U.S. at 49-50;

United States v. Davis, 413 Fed. Appx. 312, 313 fn. 3 (1st Cir. 2011).

                    i. Nature and Circumstances of the Offense, and Seriousness of the
                       Offense

       In determining the particular sentence to be imposed on Defendant by analyzing the nature

and circumstances of the offense, the Court should consider the need for the sentence to “reflect

the seriousness of the offense.” 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A). This case involves the illegal

possession, disposition, and proliferation of firearms. Defendant was a component part of a

trafficking supply chain that delivered illegal firearms into Massachusetts. His actions are serious

and placed lives in danger. As the First Circuit has quoted one district judge, there is an “epidemic

of handgun violence in communities within [the District of Massachusetts].” United States v.

Politano, 522 F. 3d 69, 72 (1st Cir. 2008).

       Moreover, Defendant’s crime had an adverse effect on public safety that was motivated by

                                                 6
         Case 1:19-cr-10261-NMG Document 97 Filed 04/29/22 Page 7 of 11




financial gain. Not dissimilar from the drug trafficking activity he has also engaged in, Defendant

was buying and selling firearms as a means to support himself in lieu of gainful employment. The

entrepreneurial approach Defendant took to being the middleman between his supplier, Philippe,

and his buyers demonstrates this financial motivation. Defendant employed social media to

broaden his market, advertised numerous firearms using photographs, and even attempted to

broker transactions for firearms he knew were available but did not personally possess.

Although Defendant was only involved in the firearms black market for a short period, the danger

he helped to create in Massachusetts communities is immeasurable. The fact that Defendant

disregarded the dangers caused by his conduct for the sake of his own personal financial gain is an

aggravating factor that the Court should consider when imposing sentence.

                   ii. History and Characteristics of Defendant

       Section 3553(a)(1) requires the Court to consider “the history and characteristics of the

defendant.” Defendant was 30 years old when he was arrested. He is now 32. He was born in

Stoughton in 1989 and spent most of his life in Brockton. PSR at ¶¶ 49, 50. Defendant began

consuming marijuana at 16 years old, and he used marijuana regularly until his arrest in this case.

PSR at ¶ 68. Defendant’s education is limited. He did not finish high school and instead turned

to distributing drugs as a teenager. PSR at ¶ 70. Between the ages of 17 and 20, Defendant was

convicted of multiple felony drug offenses. He continued to have interactions with the criminal

justice system into his late 20’s. See PSR at ¶¶ 36-47. However, to his credit, Defendant’s post-

arrest conduct stands in stark contrast to his pre-arrest criminal history.

       Defendant’s criminal history category tends to underrepresent the significance of his

history of drug trafficking offenses. Three controlled substance felony convictions based upon

separate instances of conduct taking place between October 20, 2006 and November 2, 2006, are
                                               7
            Case 1:19-cr-10261-NMG Document 97 Filed 04/29/22 Page 8 of 11




scored as only one “prior sentence” under the Guidelines due to the absence of intervening arrests.

See PSR at ¶¶ 31, 32, and 33. And in 2011, Defendant was convicted and sentenced in Wrentham

District Court for distribution of a Class B controlled substance, but the conviction was vacated

due to the well-documented misconduct of the drug laboratory chemist, Annie Dookhan, and is

not considered in Defendant’s criminal history score. See U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2, app. n. 6. 1 Despite

several stints of incarceration resulting from these encounters with the criminal justice system,

Defendant failed to maintain steady employment for most of his adult life and repeatedly backslid

into drug distribution as a way to support himself.

           Since Defendant’s arrest, he has stopped using marijuana, maintained steady employment,

and had no meaningful interactions with law enforcement or the criminal justice system. In

October 2019, Defendant began working at Dunkin’ Donuts. PSR at ¶ 72. His employment was

interrupted by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Id. Based on information and belief,

Defendant returned to Dunkin’ Donuts when he was able to do so, and he is employed there

currently. In June 2021, Defendant was issued a summons for Unlicensed Operation of a Motor

Vehicle, while driving a motorcycle in Brockton. Defendant reported possessing a motorcycle

learner’s permit at the time. That case was dismissed at Defendant’s arraignment on July 22,

2021. Besides this incident, the government is not aware of any other interactions Defendant has

had with law enforcement since his arrest in this case. It appears that Defendant has successfully

reversed some of the past patterns of behavior that led him to recidivate, and that he has achieved

a measure of personal growth and responsibility.

         Case 1:19-cr-10261-NMG Document 97 Filed 04/29/22 Page 9 of 11




                  iii. Respect for the Law and Just Punishment

       Under Section 3553(a), the Court must also consider the need for the sentence imposed to

promote respect for the law and to provide just punishment for the offense.              18 U.S.C.

§ 3553(a)(2). As discussed herein, Defendant’s offense conduct and related conduct is serious,

in large part because of the danger that the unchecked movement of illegal firearms poses to the

community.

       The government recognizes that Defendant has already served a period of time in custody

in connection with this case, and that further imprisonment would be extremely disruptive to the

positive patterns of behavior that Defendant has established since his arrest in this case, including

his ability to maintain employment. The government also considers the importance of continued

employment for Defendant, not only for his personal interest but also the public’s interest, in light

of Defendant’s tendencies to resort to criminal conduct to support himself financially.

Nevertheless, the Court must weigh these interests against the competing Section 3553(a) interests

in achieving certain sentencing goals. On balance, a term of imprisonment is necessary in order

to sufficiently promote respect for the law and to provide just punishment for Defendant’s offense.

                     iv. Guidelines Range and Pertinent Policy Statements

     The Guidelines themselves are a Section 3553(a) factor. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(4).

 “The fact that § 3553(a)(4) explicitly directs sentencing courts to consider the Guidelines supports

the premise that district courts must begin their analysis with the Guidelines and remain cognizant

 of them throughout the sentencing process.” Gall, 552 U.S.at 50, n.6. One of the Sentencing

 Commission’s purposes in promulgating the Guidelines was to “assure the meeting of the purposes

 of sentencing as set forth in section 3553(a)(2).” 28 U.S.C. §§ 991(b)(1)(A), 994(f).           The

 Commission wrote the Guidelines to “carry out these same § 3553(a) objectives,” resulting in “a
        Case 1:19-cr-10261-NMG Document 97 Filed 04/29/22 Page 10 of 11




set of Guidelines that seek to embody the § 3553(a) considerations, both in principle and in

practice.” Rita, 551 U.S. at 350.

       Departures provide authorized adjustments to a Guidelines sentencing range and perform

“an integral function in the sentencing guideline system.” U.S.S.G. § 5K2.0, comment. (backg’d).

In addition to its motion for a downward departure, see D.E. 95, the government directs the Court’s

attention to the Commission’s express encouragement of a downward departure under the

circumstances of this case, which have long been recognized, in practice and by statute, as a

mitigating sentencing factor. U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1. comment. (backg’d).

                                        CONCLUSION

       For the all the reasons set forth herein and in the government’s motion for a downward

departure, the government requests that the Court depart downwards from Defendant’s applicable

Guidelines sentencing range and recommends a sentence of 7 months imprisonment, 24 months of

supervised release, and a mandatory special assessment of $100.
