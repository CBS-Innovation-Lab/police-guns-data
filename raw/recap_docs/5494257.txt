                    GOVERNMENT’S SENTENCING MEMORANDUM

       The United States of America, by its attorneys, Michael J. Sullivan, United States

Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, and William F. Bloomer, Assistant U.S. Attorney,

submits its Sentencing Memorandum with respect to Enrique Agosto (“Agosto”).1

                                        INTRODUCTION

       Agosto was a customer of a heroin distribution organization headed by Julio Santiago
       and located in the Greater Lowell area. He ordered multi-gram quantities of heroin
       from Santiago over the telephone and via a paging device. Intercepted telephone
       conversations also revealed that Agosto was a heroin user who tested the quality of
       heroin for Santiago by ingesting it. On May 5, 2004, Lowell Police detectives stopped
       Agosto and seized from him a compressed “finger” of heroin weighing 10.14 grams and
       600 small plastic “moonwalk” baggies containing 12.67 grams of heroin. Agosto is a
       career criminal who faces a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 10 years. He
       has pled guilty pursuant to a so-called “C-Plea” with an agreed disposition of between
       188 and 235 months’ incarceration and an 8-year term of supervised release.




       1
          As this Court is aware, following a ten-day trial in October 2006, a jury returned guilty
verdicts against five of the eleven codefendants in this case –Julio SANTIAGO, Juan NUNEZ,
Carlos COLON (a/k/a Pedro MIRANDA), Jose RODRIGUEZ, and Carlos SANCHEZ -- with
respect to Count One of the Superseding Indictment. The jury also found Julio Santiago guilty
of the firearms offenses set forth in Count Seven, namely, possession of firearms in furtherance
of a drug trafficking crime, and possession of unregistered firearms, to wit: silencers, (Count
Eight). The jury further found that the conspiracy as a whole was responsible for more than
1,000 grams of heroin. The remaining seven defendants, including AGOSTO, have pleaded
guilty. AGOSTO is the last defendant to be sentenced.

                                           ANALYSIS

       To determine a defendant’s sentence, this Court must follow the three-step sentencing

approach espoused by the First Circuit. United States v. Dixon, 449 F.3d 194, 204 (1st Cir.

2006); United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 518 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc); United

States v. Robinson, 433 F.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir. 2005). First, this Court must calculate the advisory

guideline range. E.g., United States v. Pho, 433 F.3d 53, 61 (1st Cir. 2006). Second, the Court

must determine whether any traditional departures apply to the case at hand. E.g., United States

v. Saez, 444 F.3d 15, 17 (1st Cir. 2006); see also Rita v. United States, 127 S.Ct. 2456 (2007)

(“trial court should begin all sentencing proceedings by correctly calculating the applicable

Guidelines range.”). Finally, the Court needs to determine whether any factors put forth in 18

U.S.C. § 3553(a) offer a persuasive reason to impose a sentence outside of the proposed

guideline range. E.g., Robinson, 433 F.3d at 35; see Rita, supra (trial court should consider all of

the 3553(a) factors to determine whether they support the sentence requested by a party).

       With the elimination of the mandatory status of the sentencing guidelines in United

States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), sentences are now reviewed on appeal for

"reasonableness" under an abuse-of-discretion standard. See Gall v. United States, 128 S. Ct.

586, 594 (2007) (familiar abuse-of-discretion standard applies to appellate review of sentencing

decisions post-Booker); see also Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 518 (appellate review of sentence

is one of “reasonableness”). But cf. Rita v. United States, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2463-2467 (2007)

(appeals court - not district court - may apply presumption of reasonableness for a properly

calculated within-guidelines-range sentence).2

        In Gall v. United States, the Supreme Court noted that a district judge must give “serious

consideration” to the extent of any departure from the Guidelines and further “must explain his

conclusion that an unusually lenient or an unusually harsh sentence is appropriate in a particular

case with sufficient justifications.” 128 S. Ct. at 594. The Gall Court nevertheless emphasized

that the district court “must make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented.”

Id. at 597.   The Court further observed that the sentencing judge was in the best position to

evaluate § 3553(a) factors in an individual case; that he or she had greater familiarity with the

individual defendant; and that his or her findings should be accorded due deference on appeal.

Id. at 597, 600, 602. The court reiterated that appellate courts should not conduct a de novo

review of district court sentencing decisions. Id. at 598; see also Koon v. United States, 518

U.S. 81, 97 (1996) (rejecting proposition that appellate court de novo review of trial court’s

sentence was necessary to avoid unwarranted disparities).

        Against this backdrop, the parties and Probation agree that the defendant is a career

offender who is responsible for at least 400 but less than 700 grams of heroin. (Plea Agreement

¶3; PSR ¶¶ 132-133, 141-143). The government further agrees with Probation that a strict

application of the career offender provision in light of the statutory maximum alleged in the

indictment would result in a Total Offense Level of 34. Nevertheless, the government urges this

Court to impose a sentence that effectively results in a three-level departure to a Total Offense

Level of 31 for a number of reasons.


        2
         As a practical matter, with certain limited exceptions set forth in the Plea Agreement
neither the government nor the defendant may prosecute an appeal if the Court sentences the
defendant to a term of at least 188 but not more than 235 months.

                                                 3
     Case 1:04-cr-10336-NMG          Document 454         Filed 02/26/2008       Page 4 of 7



       First, the government does not contest that Agosto was a drug user who tested the quality

of heroin for Santiago. Intercepted telephone conversations bear this out and the PSR confirms a

significant history of substance abuse by Agosto. (PSR ¶¶ 185-191).

       Second, although his criminal record clearly is not overstated, the offenses that serve as

predicate convictions for career offender purposes occurred more than 10 years before the date

of offense charged in the present indictment. In common vernacular, Agosto is “just barely” a

career offender.

       Third, considering Agosto’s role in this conspiracy, a term of imprisonment of not less

than 188 months is reasonable when compared to the sentences meted out to his codefendants

either following a change of plea or after trial. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6) (court must consider

the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities); United States v. Thurston,456 F.3d at 216

(discussing Congressional goal of promoting national uniformity in sentencing). For example,

three mid-level dealers in this conspiracy – Luis Sanchez, Edwin Torrez, and Zuleima Reyes –

received sentences of 30 to 37 months in prison after pleading guilty. Another mid-level dealer

– Jose Torrado – received a mandatory minimum of 60 months in prison following a guilty plea.

These individuals were more-or-less operating at the same distribution level in the organization

as Agosto. Because of his record of prior drug convictions, Agosto will serve more time in

prison than the following individuals who played more prominent roles in the conspiracy: Juan

Nunez, Santiago’s New York-based heroin supplier, was sentenced to 151 months in prison after

trial; Carlos Sanchez, a prominent customer of Santiago’s who was responsible for more than

1,000 grams of heroin himself, was sentenced to 127 months in prison after trial; Reynaldo

Rivera, Santiago’s right-hand man who had close to 200 grams of heroin and sophisticated

     Case 1:04-cr-10336-NMG           Document 454         Filed 02/26/2008       Page 5 of 7



heroin processing equipment in his apartment when arrested, was sentence to 88 months in

prison after pleading guilty; and Pedro Miranda, a close associate of Santiago’s who allowed his

residence to be used for heroin processing, was sentenced to 72 months after trial.

       Indeed, the only defendants who will serve more time in prison than Agosto as a result of

this prosecution is Santiago himself, who was sentenced to 248 months after trial for heroin and

firearm charges, and Jose Rodriguez, another career offender with a history of drug distribution

and violent crimes spanning three decades who opted to go to trial and was sentenced to 264

months in prison. The case against Rodriguez, it should be noted, was stronger from the

government’s perspective.

       That the operative effect of the C-Plea Agreement is a three level reduction in Agosto’s

Total Offense Level clearly inures to the benefit of the defendant.3 On the other hand, the

government for its part secures a conviction against the defendant for the most serious, readily

provable offense without having to marshal some 20-plus witnesses for another one or two-week

trial while also obtaining an appeal waiver -- not an insignificant consideration in and of itself.

See United States v. Yeje-Cabrera, 430 F.3d 1, 24 (1st Cir. 2005) ("Defendants who plead guilty

will receive a benefit in sentencing over those who do not, in both charge bargaining and fact

bargaining situations."); see also Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357, 365 (1978) ("Plea

bargaining flows from 'the mutuality of advantage' to defendants and prosecutors, each with his



       3
        As a career offender with a Criminal History Category (“CHC”) of VI, a Total Offense
Level of 34 results in a GSR of 262 to 327 months whereas a Total Offense Level of 31 results in
a GSR of 188 to 235 months. Had the defendant not been classified as a career offender, his
Total Offense Level would have been 23 after acceptance and his CHC would have been IV,
yielding a GSR of 70 to 87 months. This GSR is trumped, however, by the 10-year statutory
mandatory minimum sentence under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B)(i).

own reasons for wanting to avoid trial.") (quoting Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 752

(1970)).

         Finally, the government respectfully suggests that a sentence of no less than fifteen and

one-half years in prison is “sufficient, but not greater than necessary” to reflect the seriousness of

the offense, to promote respect for the law and to provide just punishment, to afford adequate

deterrence and to protect the public, and to provide the defendant with needed medical care and

correctional treatment. The government therefore urges this Court to accept the proposed C-

Plea.

C. Sentence

         For reasons set forth above, the government recommends a term of 188 months’

imprisonment to be followed by 8 years’ supervised release.4 In light of the defendant's criminal

history and his involvement in this conspiracy, the government’s recommendation is reasonable,

United States v. Jiminenez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 518 (1st Cir. 2006)(en banc), and in accord

with federal judicial precedent to date interpreting the Sentencing Guidelines and their

application.
