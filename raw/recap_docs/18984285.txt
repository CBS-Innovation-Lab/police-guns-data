                        DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

             v.                           Criminal No. 11-cr-80-01-JL

Jemel Been


                                  O R D E R


        The assented to motion to reschedule jury trial (document no.

7) filed by defendant is granted; Final Pretrial is rescheduled to

November 21, 2011 at 2:30 PM; Trial is continued to the two-week

period beginning December 6, 2011, 9:30 AM.

        Defendant shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights within 10

days.    The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting

a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv), for the

reasons set forth in the motion.

        SO ORDERED.
