                        UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                             DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

                 v.                                   Case No. 05-cr-46-01-SM

Steven Hall

                                              ORDER

       Defendant Hall’s motion to continue the final pretrial conference and trial is granted

(document 7). Trial has been rescheduled for the October 2006 trial period. Defendant Hall

shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights not later than August 4, 2006. On the filing of such

waiver, his continuance shall be effective.

       The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance outweigh the

best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in

that failure to grant a continuance would unreasonably deny defendant the reasonable time

necessary for effective preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances.

       Final Pretrial Conference: September 25, 2006 at 3:00 p.m.

       Jury Selection: October 3, 2006 at 9:30 a.m.



       SO ORDERED.
