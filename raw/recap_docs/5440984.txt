RE: Criminal Case No: 04-10164-DPW
Dear Mr. Quinn:

The VA Boston Healthcare Systern received an Order to enforce a subpoena for the
records of Jacqueline Santiago from Magistrate Judge Judith Dein in the above-captioned
case in August. Ms. Santiago is apparently a witness in the case.

After discussion with Assistant U.S. Attorney Donaid Cabell, I have notified the
VA Medical Center to release the records to you under the terms of the order.

lf Ms. 'Santiago has consented to the disclosure, the records may be disclosed to
counsel. In the absence of consent, because we believe the records are protected by 38
USC 7332, We ask that you present them to the court for in camera review, to apply the
following test:

“If authorized by an appropriate order of a court of competent jurisdiction granted
after application showing good cause therefore In assessing good cause, the court
shall weigh the public interest and the need for disclosure against the injury to the
patient .. Upon the granting of such order, the court, in determining the extent to
which any disclosure of all or any part of any record is necessary, shall impose
appropriate safeguards against unauthorized disclosure.” 38 USC 73 32(b)(2)(D).

Let me know if l can provide further information
