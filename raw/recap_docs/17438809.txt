   ORDER DENYING DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR REDUCTION OF SENTENCE

       On July 29, 2009, the Court sentenced Katrina Wickett to a term of incarceration of

eighteen months, three years supervised release, and a $100 special assessment for making a

false statement in the acquisition of firearms, a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(a)(6). On March 8,

2010, Ms. Wickett moved for a reduction of her sentence, asking the Court to place her in home

confinement, so that she can be with her three children. Mot. for Reduction of Sentence (Docket

# 67). The Government objects. Resp. to Def.’s Pro Se Mot. for a Reduction of Sentence

(Docket # 68). Ms. Wickett replied. Def.’s Reply (Docket # 69).

       The Court cannot grant Ms. Wickett’s motion. To the extent the motion seeks to reduce

sentence, the Court does not have the authority to do so. Federal law provides that a “court may

not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed.” 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c); United

States v. Griffin, 524 F.3d 71, 83 n.13 (1st Cir. 2008). There are some limited exceptions, but

none is applicable here.    See Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(a) (allowing a trial court to correct an

“arithmetical, technical, or other clear error,” if the motion is filed within fourteen days after

sentencing); Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(b) (allowing a trial court to reduce a defendant’s sentence if the

Government moves for a reduction); 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A) (allowing a sentence reduction if

the Director of the Bureau of Prisons moves for one and only in strictly limited circumstances

not available here); 18 U.S.C. § 2255 (providing for a habeas corpus petition).1 To the extent the

motion seeks an order directing the Bureau of Prisons to place Ms. Wickett in a particular facility

or program, the authority to designate a place of confinement for federal prisoners rests with the

Bureau of Prisons, not with the Court. 18 U.S.C. § 3621(b); United States v. Guerrette, 389 F.

Supp. 2d 10, 12 (D. Me. 2005).

        In her motion, Ms. Wickett says that she has been held in West Virginia, which is so far

from her home in Maine that she has not been able to see her three children, that her mother is ill,

that she has learned a life lesson, that she has grown both as a woman and spiritually, has

remained on good conduct, has become more focused and mature, has taken multiple courses,

and has aspirations to complete school and open a business upon her release. The Court takes

Ms. Wickett at her word, congratulates her on her progress during her incarceration, and wishes

her well upon her release. But, her achievements during incarceration will have to be their own

reward. The Court cannot either reduce or revise her sentence as she requests.

        The Court DENIES Katrina Wickett’s Motion for Reduction of Sentence (Docket # 69).

        SO ORDERED.

  Ms. Wickett later clarified that she is not seeking a reduced sentence, but a revised sentence. The Court does not
have the authority to order her to home detention whether such an order would be considered a reduction or a
revision.
