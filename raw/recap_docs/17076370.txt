            ORDER ON DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO SUPPRESS


     The motion to suppress is DENIED.

     The defendant made three arguments in his written motion to suppress the

statements that he made to Special Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,

Firearms & Explosives (ATF) on April 21, 2004, while in custody en route to

Cumberland County Jail:

        a. The statements were the fruits of the illegalities which
           were set forth in Defendant’s Motion to Suppress
           Statements [of October 11, 2005 (Docket Item 32)] which
           have been incorporated herein by reference[;]

        b. Defendant was not properly informed of his rights as
           provided in Miranda[];

        c. The statements were not knowingly, voluntarily and
           intelligently given.

       I have previously ruled against the defendant with respect to argument (a).

See Order Affirming Recommended Decision of the Magistrate Judge of April 14,

2006 (Docket Item 69).

       With respect to argument (b), based upon the evidentiary hearing

conducted July 7, 2006, I find that ATF Special Agent Michael Grasso properly

informed the defendant of the rights guaranteed by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S.

436 (1966), before the defendant made any of the statements in question on April

21, 2004.

       With respect to argument (c), based upon the same evidentiary hearing, I

find that any statements the defendant made to the ATF Special Agents on

April 21, 2004, en route to the jail, were voluntary. The evidence is that the

agents initially made only small talk with the defendant during the car ride,

conversation not involving the criminal case.1                 Then the defendant himself

volunteered information about the case, without being asked.                       Although the

agents asked minor follow up questions to clarify particular things the defendant

said, there was no threatening, coercion, compulsion or persuasion.                             See

Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157, 167 (1986) (“[C]oercive police activity is a


1 The defendant has not argued that he stood upon his Miranda rights rather than waive them.
But e ven assuming that the defendant had invoked his right to remain silent, these questions did
not violate Miranda . See Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 301 (1980) (interrogation in violation

reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response . . .”) (emphasis added); United States v.

(quotation marks omitted); United States v. Genao, 281 F.3d 305, 310 (1st Cir.

2002) (confession not coerced when “police did not apply undue or unusual

pressure to [the defendant], use coercive tactics, or threaten him with violence or

retaliation . . . ”); United States v. Vega-Figueroa, 234 F.3d 744, 749 (1st Cir.

2000) (voluntariness of statement depends on “whether the will of the defendant

had been overborne so that the statement was not his free and voluntary act . . .”)

(quoting Procunier v. Atchley, 400 U.S. 446, 453 (1971)).

      At the hearing, and later, in a post-hearing Memorandum, the defendant

argued that the government had not met its burden of proof to show that his

arrest was legal, and that therefore his post-arrest statements must be

suppressed, citing Whiteley v. Warden, 401 U.S. 560 (1971), and Brown v. Illinois,

422 U.S. 590 (1975). See Mem. in Support of Mot. to Suppress at 1-2 (Docket

Item 96). Whiteley involved an arrest by an officer who did not himself have

probable cause or an arrest warrant; instead he had been informed by radio

bulletin that another officer had obtained a warrant. Id. at 563. Because the

underlying warrant was determined to be invalid and not based on probable

cause, the Supreme Court suppressed the physical evidence seized during the

arrest that relied on that invalid warrant. Id. at 568-69. Here, however, the

defendant’s arrest occurred after the issuance of a federal warrant.                          The

defendant has not challenged probable cause for the warrant,2 but only the

government’s asserted failure to prove at the hearing that the arrest (made by a

Maine state trooper before the ATF Special Agents arrived) was legal.                         The

evidentiary hearing established, however, that ATF Special Agent Christopher

Durkin informed the trooper of the warrant’s issuance before the trooper made

the arrest.     In the absence of a specific objection to the underlying federal

warrant, under the “fellow officer” rule that information was sufficient to establish

probable cause for the state trooper to arrest the defendant. See Whiteley, 401

U.S. at 568 (“Certainly police officers called upon to aid other officers in executing

arrest warrants are entitled to assume that the officers requesting aid offered the

magistrate the information requisite to support an independent judicial

assessment of probable cause.”); see also United States v. Meade, 110 F.3d 190,



questioning of in-custody suspects constitutes interrogation . . .”).
2 Specifically, the defendant’s lawyer stated that he did not challenge probable cause for the

warrant’s issuance, but rather was making the procedural argument that “[i]t is the government’s
burden of proof to show that the warrant upon which the arrest of [the defendant] was made, was
issued upon a finding of probable cause.” Mem. in Support of Motion to Suppress at 1. Thus, in
making this argument, the defendant does not actually contest the Magistrate Judge’s issuance of
the federal arrest warrant and his underlying determination of probable cause. Nor does he
contest the underlying affidavit by Special Agent Durkin which supplied the basis for the warrant.
 See Compl., Aff. of Christopher J. Durkin (Docket Item 1). As the affidavit and warrant are
available and matters of record in this case, in the absence of specific arguments that no probable
cause existed, the “procedural” argument fails. See 2 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure
§ 3.5(b) (4th ed. 2004) (even assuming that prosecution h as burden of showing probable cause in
such cases, “it is nonetheless appropriate to impose upon the defendant the burden of
articulating . . . objections . . .”).

                                                                                                 4
Case 2:05-cr-00069-DBH Document 98 Filed 07/12/06 Page 5 of 8           PageID #: 643



193 (1st Cir. 1997) (under the fellow officer rule, “when a law enforcement officer

with information amounting to probable cause [as is the case when an officer

obtains a valid arrest warrant] directs an officer who lacks the knowledge to make

the arrest, we ‘impute’ to the arresting officer the directing officer’s knowledge”); 2

LaFave, supra, § 3.5(b) (the fellow officer rule applies to communications between

federal and state law enforcement officers).         Therefore, suppression is not

warranted because, unlike Whiteley, the arrest here was based on probable

cause.

      Alternatively, even if the initial arrest was somehow improper, there is no

per se rule that all statements following illegal arrests must be suppressed.

Instead, under Brown v. Illinois, 422 U.S. 590, 603-04 (1975), a court must

consider the following factors in deciding whether to suppress such statements:

(1) the “important factor” of whether Miranda warnings were given; (2) the

“temporal proximity of the arrest and the confession”; (3) the “presence of

intervening circumstances”; and (4) the “purpose and flagrancy of the official

misconduct.” See also United States v. Ayres, 725 F.2d 806, 810 (1st Cir. 1984)

(quoting Brown factors). I have already determined that these statements were

given voluntarily after proper Miranda warnings. This “important” factor weighs

against suppression. As for temporal proximity, although neither Special Agent

testified to the length of time that elapsed between the defendant’s arrest by the



                                                                                     5

state trooper and his statements to the federal agents in the car, I conclude that it

must have exceeded an hour and a half.3 This comparatively short time weighs

somewhat in favor of suppression, see Brown, 422 U.S. at 604 (suppressing

statement that was separated from illegal arrest by “less than two hours”). The

third factor weighs against suppression. Here, after Miranda warnings were

given, the defendant volunteered information related to the case without

interrogation, and “some courts have treated a volunteered statement, not made

in response to police interrogation, as a significant intervening circumstance.” 6

LaFave, supra, § 11.4(b); see also United States v. Paradis, 351 F.3d 21, 34 (1st

Cir. 2003) (holding that “[a]fter receipt of the Miranda warnings, a defendant’s

choice whether to exercise his privilege to remain silent should ordinarily be

viewed as an act of free will,” which may attenuate the illegal conduct from the

confession, in case involving illegal search, not arrest) (quoting United States v.

Esquilin, 208 F.3d 315, 319 (1st Cir. 2000); quotation marks omitted). Further,

although there was no evidence of any intervening circumstances that might have

occurred during the time the defendant was in the state trooper’s custody, he was

thereafter transferred to the custody of the Special Agents (change of custodial


3 I base this inference on the minimum amount of time that it would have taken the Special
Agents, after hearing of the arrest, to drive from Portland to the Lewiston-area highway off-ramp
where they met the state trooper, plus an amount of time in order to transfer custody and get
underway. There was otherwise no evidence about how long the defendant was in the trooper’s
custody.

officers, change of handcuffs, change of vehicles) and administered Miranda

warnings.    That was a significant intervening circumstance. Cf. Johnson v.

Louisiana, 406 U.S. 356, 365 (1972) (when authority to detain the defendant was

transferred from the illegally arresting officer to a magistrate judge, lineup

occurring after such transfer “was conducted not by ‘exploitation’ of the

challenged arrest but ‘by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the

primary taint’”) (quoting Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 488 (1963));

Holland v. McGinnis, 963 F.2d 1044, 1050-51 (7th Cir. 1992) (transfer from

custody of one police agency to another was a sufficient “break in the stream of

events” to remove taint from new confession of earlier confession illegally

obtained).   As for the last factor, the defendant has not contended that the

Special Agents or the state trooper had improper motives, or took him into

custody illegally in order to elicit a confession; instead, the defendant concedes

that probable cause existed to arrest him. Therefore, this factor weighs against

suppression.    Weighing these four factors together, I find that even if the

defendant’s underlying arrest had been illegal, the Brown v. Illinois factors

counsel against suppression of the statements he volunteered after receiving

Miranda warnings.




                                                                                7

statements.
