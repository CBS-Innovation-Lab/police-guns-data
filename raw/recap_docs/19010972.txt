                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 12-cr-17-PB

Derek Kucinski


                                  O R D E R


     Defendant has moved through counsel to continue the trial

scheduled for September 5, 2012, citing the need for additional time

engage in further plea negotiations or prepare for trial.                The

government does not object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reason and to allow time for the

parties to properly prepare for trial, the court will continue the

trial from September 5, 2012 to November 6, 2012.            In agreeing to

continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. '

3161(h)(7)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the ends of justice

served in granting a continuance outweigh the best interests of the

public and the defendant in a speedy trial.

     The August 27, 2012 final pretrial conference is continued to

October 29, 2012 at 3:00 p.m.         No further continuances.
