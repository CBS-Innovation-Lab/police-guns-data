                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 12-cr-33-PB

Craig Faulkner, et. Al.

                                  O R D E R


     Defendant Sharon Cote has moved to continue the trial in

the above case, citing the need for additional time due to her

counselâ€™s scheduling conflict with the June 5, 2012 trial date.

The government and co-defendants do not object to a continuance

of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reason and in order to allow the

parties additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court

will continue the trial from June 5, 2012 to August 21, 2012.

In agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to

18 U.S.C.A. ' 3161(h)(7)(A) that for the above-stated reasons,

the ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh

the best interests of the public and the defendants in a speedy

trial.
