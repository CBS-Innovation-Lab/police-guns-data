            RECOMMENDED DECISION ON 28 U.S.C. § 2255 MOTION

       In this action, Petitioner Jeffrey S. Hall moves, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255, to

vacate, set aside or correct his sentence. (Amended Motion, ECF No. 55.) Following a

guilty plea, Petitioner was convicted in 2003 on two counts of armed bank robbery and one

count of using a firearm in relation to the crime. The Court sentenced Petitioner to a total

of 378 months in prison. (Amended Judgment, ECF No. 27.) The First Circuit affirmed

the judgment on appeal. (United States v. Hall, No. 03-1199 (1st Cir. Dec. 16, 2003).)

       Petitioner asserts he is entitled to relief under Johnson v. United States, --- U.S. ---,

135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015), because when he was sentenced, the sentencing guidelines

contained a provision identical to the “residual clause” held unconstitutional in Johnson,

and, at the time, the guidelines were mandatory. See United States v. Booker, 543 U.S.

220, 245 (2005) (holding that the sentencing guidelines, excised of provisions the Court

held unconstitutional, are “effectively advisory”); Hardy v. United States, 871 F.3d 85, 86

(1st Cir. 2017) (granting leave to pursue, in a second or successive section 2255 motion,
the issue whether Johnson “invalidates the residual clause of the pre-Booker career

offender guideline”); Moore v. United States, 871 F.3d 72 (1st Cir. 2017).

          Following a review of Petitioner’s motion and the Government’s request for

dismissal, I recommend the Court grant the Government’s request, and dismiss Petitioner’s

motion.

                  I.       FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

          Petitioner was indicted on three counts for armed bank robbery, aiding and abetting,

18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 2113(a), (d) (Count 1); for using and carrying a firearm in relation to a

violent crime, aiding and abetting, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) (Count 2); and for

armed bank robbery, 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a) (Count 3).

          The record establishes that Petitioner’s sentence was enhanced, pursuant to USSG

§ 4B1.1, because the Court concluded he had at least two prior qualifying offenses.1 At

the time of his sentencing, Petitioner’s criminal history included several Maine state court

convictions, including two for criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon, two for

robbery, and two for burglary.

          Petitioner appealed from the sentence on the basis that the Court erred when it

denied credit for acceptance of responsibility; the First Circuit consolidated Petitioner’s

and his co-defendant’s appeals for briefing and argument, and it affirmed the judgments.

 The parties agree that Petitioner’s sentence was enhanced pursuant to the sentencing guidelines career
offender provision, USSG § 4B1.1, rather than the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA),
18 U.S.C. § 924(e). (Response, ECF No. 73 at 5; Reply, ECF No. 77 at 1n.1.)

        Petitioner filed a pro se section 2255 motion on May 31, 2016, to request relief

under Johnson.3 (Motion, ECF No. 51.) The Court granted Petitioner’s request for the

appointment of counsel. (Order, ECF No. 53.) Petitioner filed a pro se amended motion,

and Petitioner’s counsel filed a reply.                       (Amended Motion, ECF No. 55;

Reply, ECF No. 77.)

                                           II.     DISCUSSION

        A person may move to vacate his or her sentence on one of four different grounds:

(1) “that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United

States”; (2) “that the court was without jurisdiction” to impose its sentence; (3) “that the

sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law”; or (4) that the sentence

“is otherwise subject to collateral attack.” 28 U.S.C. § 2255(a); see Knight v. United States,

37 F.3d 769, 772 (1st Cir. 1994). The burden is on the section 2255 petitioner to establish

that he or she is entitled to section 2255 relief. David v. United States, 134 F.3d 470, 474

(1st Cir. 1998); United States v. DiCarlo, 575 F.2d 952, 954 (1st Cir. 1978).

        Petitioner’s claim is based on Johnson, in which the Supreme Court held that the

residual clause of the ACCA is unconstitutionally vague.4 Johnson, 135 S. Ct. at 2557.



3
  Petitioner first sought permission from the First Circuit to file a motion based on Johnson v. United States,
--- U.S. ---, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015); the First Circuit determined that although Petitioner had previously
filed a 28 U.S.C. § 2255 motion, he voluntarily dismissed it in 2005, and the Court did not reach the merits
in that proceeding. (Hall v. United States, No. 16-1273 (1st Cir. May 3, 2016).) On that basis, the First
Circuit concluded that the gatekeeping requirements did not apply, and Petitioner did not need the
permission of the First Circuit to file a section 2255 motion. (Id.) Petitioner’s prior section 2255 motion
and his voluntary dismissal are docketed in this Court at No. 2:05-cv-00026-GC, Motion, ECF No. 1;
Voluntary Dismissal, ECF No. 8.

 The ACCA provides in relevant part that a defendant “who violates [18 U.S.C. § 922(g)] and has three
previous convictions . . . for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions

                                                      3
In Beckles v. United States, --- U.S. ---, 137 S. Ct. 886 (2017), the Supreme Court held that

Johnson does not apply to career offender sentences imposed after the sentencing

guidelines became advisory, i.e., after Booker:

        At the time of petitioner’s sentencing, the advisory Sentencing Guidelines
        included a residual clause defining a ‘crime of violence’ as an offense that
        ‘involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to
        another.’ This Court held in [Johnson] that the identically worded residual
        clause in the [ACCA] was unconstitutionally vague. Petitioner contends that
        the Guidelines’ residual clause is also void for vagueness. Because we hold
        that the advisory Guidelines are not subject to vagueness challenges under
        the Due Process Clause, we reject petitioner’s argument.

different from one another, . . . shall be . . . imprisoned not less than fifteen years . . . .”
18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1). Section 924(e)(2)(B) provides:

        [T]he term “violent felony” means any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term
        exceeding one year, . . . that—

        (i)     has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against
        the person of another; or

        (ii)   is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves
        conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.

Section 924(e)(2)(B)(i) is known as the “force” clause or the “elements” clause; the provision of section
924(e)(2)(B)(ii) that references burglary, arson, extortion, or the use of explosives, is known as the
“enumerated offenses” clause; and the remainder of section 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), i.e., the provision “or
otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,” is known as
the “residual” clause. United States v. Starks, 861 F.3d 306, 314 (1st Cir. 2017); United States v. Edwards,
857 F.3d 420, 422-23 & n.2 (1st Cir. 2017).

        In Johnson, the Court left intact the force clause and the enumerated offenses clause of section
924(e)(2)(B): “Today’s decision does not call into question application of the Act to the four enumerated
offenses, or the remainder of the Act’s definition of a violent felony.” 135 S. Ct. at 2563.

  The career offender provision of the sentencing guidelines, USSG § 4B1.1(a), provides in relevant part:
“A defendant is a career offender if . . . (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either
a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.” USSG § 4B1.2(a) provided at the time of Petitioner’s
sentencing:

        The term “crime of violence” means any offense under federal or state law, punishable by
        imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that –

                                                       4
       Although the issue of whether Johnson invalidates the pre-Booker sentencing

guidelines residual clause has not been decided, see Hardy, 871 F.3d at 86; Moore,

871 F.3d at 83-84, the issue need not be resolved in Petitioner’s case, because Petitioner’s

two prior convictions for criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon qualify as career

offender predicate crimes of violence under the force clause of USSG § 4B1.2(a)(1). See

United States v. Collins, 811 F.3d 63, 66 (1st Cir. 2016) (holding that a Maine conviction

for criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon qualified as a career offender predicate

crime of violence under the force clause). Petitioner acknowledges that the convictions for

criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon qualify as predicates, but he nonetheless

requests to be resentenced. (Reply at 2-3.) Even if Johnson applied to pre-Booker career

offender determinations under the guidelines, resentencing would be warranted only if the

record established that Petitioner might not qualify as a career offender under the force

clause of USSG § 4B1.2(a)(1). See United States v. Winston, 850 F.3d 677, 680, 686

(4th Cir. 2017) (vacating and remanding for the district court to consider whether one of

the other convictions on which the enhanced sentence was based qualified as an ACCA




       (1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against
           the person of another, or

       (2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or
           otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury
           to another.

Section 4B1.2(a) was amended following Johnson, and the residual clause was deleted. USSG Supp. to
App. C, amend. 798 (Aug. 1, 2016). However, the amendment does not apply retroactively.
USSG § 1B1.10; United States v. Strevig, 663 F. App’x 908, 912 (11th Cir. 2016) (per curiam)
(“The Sentencing Commission . . . has not made Amendment 798 retroactive to individuals sentenced prior
to the effective date of the amendment.”).

violent felony, after holding that a Virginia common law robbery did not qualify), cited

with approval in Moore, 871 F.3d at 85. Here, the uncontroverted record establishes that

based on Petitioner’s two prior convictions for criminal threatening with a dangerous

weapon, Petitioner would qualify as a career offender even if the residual clause of the

guidelines was invalidated for pre-Booker guidelines sentences.

        In short, because Petitioner’s criminal history at the time of his sentencing included

two prior convictions for criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon, which is a crime

of violence under the force clause, USSG § 4B1.2(a)(1), Petitioner is not entitled to relief

under Johnson.6

                                         III.    CONCLUSION

        Based on the foregoing analysis, an evidentiary hearing is not warranted under

Rule 8 of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Cases. In addition, I recommend the Court

deny Petitioner’s motion for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. I further recommend

that the Court deny a certificate of appealability pursuant to Rule 11 of the Rules Governing

6
 The Government does not argue that Petitioner’s prior burglary offenses qualify as predicate offenses.
(Response at 6-7.) In addition, Petitioner’s prior robbery offenses, which the parties agree (Response at 9;
Reply at 2) were convictions under 17-A M.R.S. § 651(1)(B), (E), do not qualify as career offender
predicates under the ACCA force clause, following United States v. Mulkern, 854 F.3d 87 (1st Cir. 2017)
(holding that a Maine robbery under 17-A M.R.S. § 651(1)(C) was not an ACCA violent felony).
(Response at 10-11.)

        The Court need not determine whether Petitioner’s Maine robbery offenses qualify as career
offender predicates under the enumerated offenses clause, because the two prior offenses of criminal
threatening with a dangerous weapon alone support the career offender sentencing enhancement.
See United States v. Ball, 870 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2017) (concluding that a Pennsylvania robbery qualified
as a guidelines enumerated offense); United States v. Williams, No. 2:15-cr-00069-JDL-01,
2017 WL 3485562, at *5, 2017 U.S. Dist. Lexis 128774, at *14-15 (D. Me. Aug. 14, 2017) (concluding
that a Maine robbery with the use of a dangerous weapon, i.e., a conviction under both
17-A M.R.S. § 651(1)(B) and § 1252(4), qualified as a guidelines enumerated offense).
