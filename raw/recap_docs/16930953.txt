  ORDER ON MOTION TO RECONSIDER AND RENEWED MOTION TO DISMISS


      In light of additional documents the defendant recently has obtained, the

government does not object to reconsideration of my February 7, 2005, denial of the

defendant’s motion to dismiss.      I therefore GRANT the motion to reconsider.

However, I DENY the defendant’s renewed motion to dismiss and I DENY the

defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea.

      In relevant summary, the newly-provided documents demonstrate that the

Somerville, Massachusetts, Police Department issued the defendant a license to carry

firearms in 1988; that in the same year the defendant was convicted in Ellsworth,

Maine, for Threatening Display of a Concealed Weapon and Carrying a Concealed

Weapon and that the Somerville Police Department subsequently revoked his license;

that in 1989 he was convicted in Cambridge, Massachusetts of (among other things)

carrying a dangerous weapon but the weapon was not seized; and that in 1990 his

Firearms Identification Card (which apparently had been issued in 1983) was revoked

and he was instructed to turn in all firearms and ammunition in his possession.

      The defendant therefore renews his argument that I should follow the lead of
    Case 2:04-cr-00111-DBH Document 53 Filed 08/11/05 Page 2 of 4                  PageID #: 207



Massachusetts authorities and treat his previous Massachusetts 1977 convictions for

assault    with    a   dangerous      weapon     as    misdemeanors,       not    felonies,   thereby

disqualifying them as predicate offenses. He argues that if Massachusetts authorities

had treated them as felonies, they would never have granted him the license or

firearms identification card, that his weapon would have been seized, etc.

       I rejected a similar argument previously (in denying the motion to dismiss)

when it was based upon what a Massachusetts state district judge did in a 1990

conviction. As I observed then, I could not ascertain what the Massachusetts judge

knew about the 1977 convictions and, regardless, a mistake by the Massachusetts

judge in 1990 would not change the proper analysis now of the effect of the 1977

convictions. The same two conclusions apply to the new documentation concerning

police treatment. First, there is no affirmative showing that the police authorities in

question were aware of the 1977 convictions.1 Second, even if they were aware, my

decision is based on an independent analysis of the effect of the 1977 convictions and

is not altered by any later misapprehension by Massachusetts (or Maine) police

authorities.

       There is no viable entrapment by estoppel defense here. First, the defendant

has shown no affirmative misstatements by federal authorities, the prosecuting

government in this case.         See United States v. Caron, 64 F.3d 713, 717 (1st Cir.

1995). Second, any reliance by the defendant was not reasonable: according to the

records submitted by the defendant, he did not disclose his 1977 convictions to

1 In fact, on the application for a firearms license, dated June 15, 1988, although the defendant
responded “yes” to the question, “Have you ever been convicted of any offense against the law, or are
you now under charges for any offense against the law?”, when asked to “give date(s), list offenses and
disposition of charges,” the only information he gave was “1985 DWI program.”

police authorities.

      There is therefore no reason to permit the defendant to withdraw his

conditional guilty plea. I do not find the short allusion to his wife’s tragic illness to

be sufficient. The defendant apparently learned of her diagnosis the day I ruled on

the government’s motion in limine. He entered his conditional plea four days later on

February 7, 2005. At the time, I conducted an extensive Rule 11 colloquy and there

was nothing to suggest that his conditional guilty plea was anything but voluntary.

      I previously allowed postponement of sentencing pending further medical

information on the defendant’s wife’s terminal illness. The lawyers shall confer and

notify the clerk’s office concerning their positions about scheduling sentencing.



      SO ORDERED.
