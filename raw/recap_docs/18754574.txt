                 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                   FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

      Plaintiff,

                 v.                       CRIMINAL NO. 10-357 (FAB)

EDWIN BERNARD ASTACIO-ESPINO,

      Defendant.


                          OPINION AND ORDER

BESOSA, District Judge.

     Pending before the Court is defendant’s motion to compel

discovery.   (Docket No. 79.)        Having examined the motion, the

government’s response, and defendant’s reply to that response, the

motion to compel is DENIED.

I.   Procedural Background

     On May 13, 2010, the government filed a criminal complaint

against   defendant   Edwin   Bernard    Astacio-Espino    (“defendant”)

alleging three counts, including disabling an aircraft in the

special jurisdiction of the United States, endangering the lives of

two individuals engaged in the operation of a helicopter and

killing a third, and discharging a firearm in furtherance of a

violent crime.     (Docket No. 3.)      A grand jury later returned an

indictment charging defendant Astacio-Espino with: (1) destruction

Criminal No. 10-357 (FAB)                                                   2

of an aircraft in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 32(a)(1) and 34;

(2) using, carrying, and possessing a firearm in furtherance of a

crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1)(A)(iii)

and 924(j)(1); (3) performing an act of violence in a manner likely

to endanger an aircraft in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 32(a)(6); and

(4) possession of a machine gun in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(o)

and 924(a)(2).       (Docket No. 19.)   On May 20, 2010, the government

certified that the offenses charged in the complaint carried a

maximum penalty of death and requested that the Court identify this

case as capital.       (Docket No. 7.)       Following defendant Astacio-

Espino’s arrest and initial detention, a detention hearing was held

on September 8, 2010.       (Docket No. 15.)        At that hearing, Chief

U.S. Magistrate Judge Justo Arenas found him to be a flight risk

and a danger to the community.       (Docket No. 16.)     Magistrate Judge

Arenas issued an order of detention pending trial finding that “no

condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure his

appearance as required or the safety of any other person and the

community.”     (Docket No. 17 at 6-7.)

     On March 14, 2011, defendant Astacio-Espino filed a motion to

compel discovery of the following items:         (1) unredacted copies of

several FBI 302 reports; (2) notes of agents investigating the

case;    (3)   all    materials   prepared    and    relied   upon   by   the
      Case 3:10-cr-00357-FAB Document 95 Filed 05/09/11 Page 3 of 15



Criminal No. 10-357 (FAB)                                               3

government’s expert witnesses; (4) a file which allegedly contains

information regarding a 2007 police brutality incident; (5) all

material covered by the Jencks Act; and (6) a “black box” or GPS

device from the helicopter involved in the incident giving rise to

the indictment.      (See Docket No. 79.)       On April 5, 2011, the

government   filed   a   response    opposing    the   motion,   arguing:

(1) that material was redacted from the FBI 302 reports either to

protect the safety of the persons interviewed or because that

information was not discoverable; (2) that disclosure of the names

of any of its witnesses is not required until three days prior to

trial; (3) that it is under no obligation to produce any Jencks Act

material at this time; (4) that it has complied with its duty under

Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963); (5) that it has provided

expert witness material as required by Federal Rule of Criminal

Procedure 16 (“Rule 16”); (6) that the helicopter to which the

indictment referred did not contain a “black box” or similar

device; and (7) that defendant Astacio-Espino has provided no

reason for the disclosure of the 2007 FBI report that supersedes

the general rule against disclosure of documents related to the

investigation of a case.    (See Docket No. 84.)       On April 22, 2011,

plaintiff filed a reply.    (Docket No. 89.)     On April 25, 2011, the

Court ordered the government to submit redacted and unredacted

Criminal No. 10-357 (FAB)                                                        4

copies of the relevant FBI 302 reports no later than May 2, 2011

for in camera inspection. The government complied with the Court’s

order, submitting the redacted and unredacted versions of the FBI

302 reports identified in the motion to compel.

II.   Legal Analysis

      A.       Brady Standard1

               Brady requires the government to produce to a defendant,

in advance of trial, material exculpatory evidence that is within

its possession.        See 373 U.S. at 87; United States v. Agurs, 427

U.S. 97, 107 (1976); United States v. Huddleston, 194 F.3d 214, 222

(1st Cir. 1999). Evidence that is “within its possession” includes

exculpatory       material   in    the    possession    of     any   agency   that

participated in investigations related to the crimes charged.                  See

Kyles     v.   Whitley,   514     U.S.   419,   438   (1995)    (Brady   requires

production of evidence “known only to the police investigators and

not to the prosecutors”).          “Evidence is material under Brady only

when ‘there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been

disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have




      1
        The Court makes clear that          the obligation to provide Brady
material is especially serious in a         case such as this one, where the
penalty of death is being sought            by the government.      Given the
seriousness of that obligation, any         failure to disclose materials in
compliance with Brady that may come to      light will be dealt with severely.

Criminal No. 10-357 (FAB)                                                      5

been different.’”       United States v. Dumas, 207 F.3d 11, 15 (1st

Cir. 2000).     The duty to produce material exculpatory information

encompasses the duty to investigate “any favorable evidence known

to others acting on the government’s behalf in the case, including

the police.”     Kyles, 514 U.S. at 437.           See also Ruiz v. United

States, 221 F.Supp.2d 66, 74 (D.Mass. 2002).                 “Brady does not,

however, establish any ‘general constitutional right to discovery

in a criminal case . . . .’” United States v. Rodriguez-Rivera, 473

F.3d 21, 25-26 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting United States v. Caro-

Muñiz, 406 F.3d 22, 29 (1st Cir. 2005)).

           Much of the evidence requested by defendant Astacio-

Espino is primarily targeted for the purposes of impeachment.

(See Docket No. 159.)      “As a preliminary matter, it is clear that

impeachment evidence falls within the Brady rule.” Dumas, 207 F.3d

at 16 (citing Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154 (1972)).

“The   simple   fact   that     evidence   could   be    used   to   impeach   a

government witness, however, does not end the materiality inquiry.”

Id.    “‘Impeachment evidence, even that which tends to further

undermine the credibility of the key Government witness whose

credibility     has   already    been   shaken   due    to   extensive   cross-

examination, does not create a reasonable doubt that did not

otherwise exist where that evidence is cumulative or collateral.’”

Id. (quoting United States v. Sanchez, 917 F.2d 607, 618-19 (1st

Cir. 1990)).

     B.      Specific Discovery Requests

             1.    Unredacted FBI 302 Reports

                   At the outset, it is clear that the disclosure of

the majority of the requested materials is not, at this stage of

the proceedings, required by any statute, rule, or case law.2             The

identities of the persons interviewed for the purposes of the FBI

302 reports are not, in themselves, exculpatory for the purposes of

Brady, nor is their production required under Rule 16.             Defendant

Astacio-Espino is essentially requesting that, due to the unique

circumstances of this case, the Court exercise its broad discretion

with regard to discovery in criminal cases and order the government

to produce these materials.           (See Docket No. 79.)         Defendant

Astacio-Espino requests the unredacted forms of certain FBI 302

reports that were provided by the government.            See id.   The Court




     2
        Defendant Astacio-Espino cites to several cases allowing
discovery prior to the U.S. Attorney General’s Office authorization to
seek the death penalty. (See Docket No. 79.) The situation in this
case, however, is not one in which the government has refused to provide
pre-authorization discovery.    See, e.g., United States v. Delatorre,
F.Supp.2d 892, 899-903 (N.D.Ill. 2006).      The government has indeed
provided discovery, but has redacted information which tends to identify
the declarants whose statements are recorded in the FBI 302 reports.
         Case 3:10-cr-00357-FAB Document 95 Filed 05/09/11 Page 7 of 15



Criminal No. 10-357 (FAB)                                                       7

has inspected the requested materials and it does not appear that

any of the redacted information needs to be disclosed at this time.

                   The majority of the material redacted from the FBI

302 reports deals with the identity of the persons interviewed.3

Defendant     Astacio-Espino    argues   that     the   identities   of     these

individuals      should    be   disclosed    so    that    his    counsel     may

independently investigate their statements.             See id.   It is clear,

however, that the government is not required to disclose the

identities of its witnesses until three days prior to trial in

capital cases.      See 18 U.S.C. § 3432. As this Court has previously

stated, “[i]t is within the court’s discretion whether to compel

the prosecution to furnish a witness list prior to trial.”                United

States v. Ortiz-Garcia, 553 F.Supp.2d 119, 120 (D.P.R. 2008)

(Besosa, J.).      In making this decision, the Court must balance the

government’s reasons for not disclosing the identities of its

potential witnesses against “the defendants’ specific showing of

particularized need for the names, beyond the basic assertion that




     3
        Defendant also requests three FBI 302 reports which contain
admissions by defendant Astacio-Espino overheard by the persons
interviewed. (See Docket No. 79.) Those three reports contain large
redacted portions beyond the names of those individuals. That redacted
material, however, also tends to identify the persons interviewed.
       Case 3:10-cr-00357-FAB Document 95 Filed 05/09/11 Page 8 of 15



Criminal No. 10-357 (FAB)                                                      8

such a list would aid in trial preparation.”             Id. (citing United

States v. Schwimmer, 649 F.Supp. 544, 550 (E.D.N.Y. 1986)).

                  This Court previously addressed a similar situation

and   found   that   disclosure     of    potential   government    witnesses’

identities was not warranted in the face of a particular threat to

those individuals’ safety.          Ortiz-Garcia, 553 F.Supp.2d at 120.

Defendant     attempts    to    distinguish    this   case   from   the   facts

presented in Ortiz-Garcia by claiming that the government has not

identified a specific danger to any potential witnesses, and that

a   generalized   claim    of    harm    is insufficient     to   withhold   the

identities of the persons interviewed in the FBI 302 reports. (See

Docket No. 79.) Having reviewed the reports, however, the redacted

material demonstrates a definite danger for potential witnesses who

cooperate or give information to the government in this case. Even

the redacted materials identify a specific fear voiced by one of

the persons interviewed for the purposes of the FBI 302 reports.

An individual interviewed on May 10, 2010 specifically expressed

that “[redacted] is extremely afraid of [defendant] and his friends

because they will kill [redacted] if they find out that [redacted]

is talking to the police.”              (emphasis added).     That statement,

which has been provided to defendant Astacio-Espino, and the

material reviewed in camera establish more than “a general claim of
         Case 3:10-cr-00357-FAB Document 95 Filed 05/09/11 Page 9 of 15



Criminal No. 10-357 (FAB)                                                   9

danger due to the nature of the charges and the case.”           (See Docket

No. 79 at 10.)

                   For the most part, defendant Astacio-Espino’s only

articulated need for the identities of the persons interviewed in

the FBI 302 reports is to investigate further the impeachment value

of their criminal backgrounds.4        The government has not identified

any of the persons interviewed in the FBI 302 reports as witnesses

for trial, nor need it do so at this point.             It has conceded to

defendant Astacio-Espino that some of the persons interviewed do

have criminal backgrounds, and has also provided some material in

the redacted FBI 302 reports which relates to some of those

criminal activities. Should the government later choose to use the

individuals interviewed in those FBI 302 reports as witnesses at

trial, some of the redacted material, or even further information

regarding the background of potential witnesses, may indeed need to

be disclosed pursuant to Brady for impeachment purposes.              At this

point in the proceedings, however, the material disclosed and

conceded by the government is sufficient for defendant Astacio-




     4
        This need is only described in reference to those civilian
witnesses which the government has conceded to have criminal backgrounds.
Defendant has provided no specific justification or need for the
disclosure of the identities of the law enforcement officers who were
interviewed for several of the FBI 302 reports. (See Docket No. 79.)

Criminal No. 10-357 (FAB)                                                    10

Espino’s counsel to represent him effectively in the death penalty

authorization process.        Accordingly, defendant Astacio-Espino’s

request for unredacted copies of the FBI 302 reports is DENIED.

            2.     Government’s Statement at Recent Status Conference

                   Defendant Astacio-Espino refers to a statement by

the government at a recent status conference “that an informant

indicated that he/she was concerned about the helicopter shooting

because he/she was involved.”             (See Docket Nos. 79 & 84.)        He

claims   that    this   statement    raises     particular   Brady   concerns.

(Docket No. 79.) The government responds that “[w]hile on its face

this   statement    insinuates      the   informant    participated    in   the

shooting,   circumstances     related      to   the   informant   demonstrate

otherwise.” The government further expresses that “if the Court so

desires, the Government is willing to provide, ex parte, additional

facts regarding this statement [so that it may] be understood in

its proper context.”         (Docket No. 84.)          In order to address

properly the defendants concerns regarding the statement and ensure

that no additional material need be disclosed, the government is

ORDERED to provide the Court, ex parte, with the additional facts

to which it refers.
       Case 3:10-cr-00357-FAB Document 95 Filed 05/09/11 Page 11 of 15



Criminal No. 10-357 (FAB)                                                     11

            3.     Jencks Act Material

                   Defendant Astacio-Espino requests that the Court

order the government “to produce all Jenck’s [sic] material during

. . . the pre-authorization stage of the proceedings.”                 He claims

that   “[t]he    possibility     of   a   death    penalty   authorization,   a

resultant capital trial and a potential death sentence clearly

trumps the Jenck’s [sic] Act restrictions on statement production.”

He cites to no legal authority, however, for this proposition. The

Jencks Act provides that “no statement or report . . . made by a

government witness or prospective witness . . . shall be subject of

subpena, discovery, or inspection until said witness has testified

on direct examination in the trial of the case.” 18 U.S.C. 3500(a).

Thus, the clear terms of that statute expressly limit the Court’s

authority to compel the government to disclose any material within

the scope of the Jencks Act, including case agents’ rough notes, at

this time.      Therefore, defendant Astacio-Espino’s request for any

Jencks Act material not subject to Brady or Rule 16 is DENIED at

this stage of the proceedings.

            4.     Helicopter “Black Box”

                   Defendant Astacio-Espino also requests that the

government be compelled to produce “the helicopter’s ‘black box,’

or   any   other   device   or    record    that    would    contain    GPS-type
        Case 3:10-cr-00357-FAB Document 95 Filed 05/09/11 Page 12 of 15



Criminal No. 10-357 (FAB)                                                          12

information of the location of the helicopter on a minute by

minute, or second by second, basis.”            (Docket No. 79.)     He concedes

that the government has already represented that no such device

exists, but “requests that the Court enter an Order directing the

government      to   produce   this   evidence,        or   to   enter    a   formal

certification that none exists.”                The government has already

informed defendant that no “black box” or similar device exists,

and has stated as much on the record. Defendant Astacio-Espino has

given the Court no reason to doubt the government’s representations

on the record nor any justification for requiring the government to

enter any certification more “formal” than those representations.

Accordingly, his request is DENIED.

               5.    Allegations    Regarding    the    Statements of         Other
                     Individuals

                     Defendant Astacio-Espino requests that the Court

order    the    government     to   produce     the    identities    of       certain

individuals mentioned in one of the FBI 302 reports.                     He claims

that “[s]ince it is to be expected that the government would have

interviewed these other individuals whom Witness A identified for

them and would have also produced these individuals’s [sic] reports

of interviews if they had also placed Mr. Astacio-Espino at the

scene, it is logical to conclude that these other individuals did
     Case 3:10-cr-00357-FAB Document 95 Filed 05/09/11 Page 13 of 15



Criminal No. 10-357 (FAB)                                                   13

not corroborate Witness A’s statements, and this information is

therefore at least potentially exculpatory.” (Docket No. 79.) The

government has stated that they did not interview any of the

individuals to which defendant Astacio-Espino refers, and that it

has complied with its discovery obligations under Brady and Rule 16

in that regard. Other than theories based entirely on speculation,

defendant Astacio-Espino has given the Court no reason to doubt the

government’s assertions.       Accordingly, his request is DENIED.

            6.   Expert Materials

                 Defendant Astacio-Espino requests that the Court

order the    production   of    “all   working   papers,   case   files    and

handwritten notes” of the government’s expert witnesses.            (Docket

No. 79 at 20.)   Rule 16, however, clearly lays out the government’s

obligation   with   regard     to   expert   materials.    With   regard   to

statements of expert witnesses, Rule 16 provides that “[a]t the

defendant’s request, the government must give to the defendant a

written summary of any testimony that the government intends to use

under Rules 702, 703, or 705 of the Federal Rules of Evidence

during its case-in-chief at trial.”            Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(G).

Further, should a defendant request it:

     the government must permit a defendant to inspect and to
     copy or photograph the results or reports of any physical
     or mental examination and of any scientific test or
     Case 3:10-cr-00357-FAB Document 95 Filed 05/09/11 Page 14 of 15



Criminal No. 10-357 (FAB)                                               14

     experiment if: (i) the item is within the government’s
     possession, custody, or control; (ii) the attorney for
     the government knows–or through due diligence could
     know–that the item exists; and (iii) the item is material
     to preparing the defense or the government intends to use
     the item in its case-in-chief at trial.

Fed.R.Crim.P.   16(a)(1)(F).      Defendant   Astacio-Espino     has   not

provided the Court with any basis to require the government to go

beyond the obligations imposed upon it by Brady or Rule 16, nor has

he indicated that the government has not complied with those

obligations.    Accordingly, defendant Astacio-Espino’s request for

additional expert materials is DENIED, especially as that request

may relate to materials within the scope of the Jencks Act.

          7.     2007 FBI Report regarding Police Brutality

                 Defendant Astacio-Espino requests production of a

2007 FBI report which allegedly details an incident of police

brutality involving himself.       (Docket No. 79.)      The government

opposes that production on the basis that he “fails . . . to

provide any details on how this incident would assist him or is

relevant to the present proceeding.”          In his reply, defendant

Astacio-Espino claims that the incident’s relevance to this case

“is evidence and does not need extensive elaboration.”          Defendant

provides little more explanation for his request other than to

conclude that the report would be “at least relevant to issues of
     Case 3:10-cr-00357-FAB Document 95 Filed 05/09/11 Page 15 of 15



Criminal No. 10-357 (FAB)                                                  15

mitigation at any potential sentencing in this case.”             Given the

conclusory nature of his proffered basis for ordering production of

the 2007 FBI report, defendant Astacio-Espino’s request is DENIED

WITHOUT   PREJUDICE   pending   a   renewed    motion   which    more   fully

explains,   and   supports   with   legal     authority,   the   mitigating

potential of the report.

III. Conclusion

     For the reasons described above, defendant’s motion to compel,

(Docket No. 79), is DENIED.     As detailed above in section II.B.2,

the government is ordered to provide, ex parte, the additional

facts relating to its statement at a recent status conference

regarding the potential involvement in the crime charged.

     IT IS SO ORDERED.
