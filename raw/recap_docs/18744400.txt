                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE




United States of America

     v.                                   Criminal No. 05-cr-60-PB

Howard Fosher, et al.



                                  O R D E R


     The defendant has moved to continue the September 6, 2005

trial in the above case, citing complicating factors of medical

treatment required for his cancer and the need for additional

time to prepare for trial.        The government and co-defendant

Timothy Doyon do not object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reason and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from September 6, 2005 until November 1, 2005.

In agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
