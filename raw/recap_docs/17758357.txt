                              UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                                DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND


UNITED STATES OF AMERICA                          :
                                                  :
          v.                                      :           CR. No. 12-036S
                                                  :
CHARLES FERMIN                                    :


                                MEMORANDUM AND ORDER


       In this matter, Defendant Charles Fermin filed a Notice of Appeal in this Court on January

17, 2013 and subsequently sought pauper status in the First Circuit Court of Appeals. The Court of

Appeals directed Fermin to seek in forma pauperis (“IFP”) status in the District Court. On May 14,

2013, Fermin filed an Application to Proceed In District Court Without Prepaying Fees or Costs (the

“Application”). (Document No. 59). The Application has been referred to me for determination.

28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A); LR Cv 72.

       In the Application, Fermin indicated that he is incarcerated, that he is not employed at the

prison and that he has an available balance of $30.20 in his prison trust account. Fermin failed,

however, to fulfill the requirements for obtaining IFP status on appeal. On March 4, 2013, the Court

of Appeals issued an Order stating that Fermin had failed to file a “compliant request for IFP status”

and indicated that a compliant request must include a “motion, fully completed Form 4, Financial

Affidavit and prison trust account statement....” (Court of Appeals Docket No. 13-1108, Document

No. 00116499939). Fermin was also notified that his Appellate Court Motion was deficient because

it failed to “state the issues to be presented on appeal and is not accompanied by a certified copy of

appellant’s statement from the institutional trust account statement.” Id.

       This Court cannot determine whether Fermin qualifies to have his Application granted in this

case until the proper documentation is received. The Clerk is directed to enclose a copy of Form 4
Case 1:12-cr-00036-S-LDA Document 60 Filed 05/22/13 Page 2 of 2 PageID #: 322



for Fermin’s completion. In addition to completing Form 4, Fermin must also file a Motion stating

the issues to be presented on appeal, as well as a certified copy of his prison trust account statement.

       Fermin must file the proper documentation on or before June 30, 2013 or risk having his

Application denied.

SO ORDERED.
