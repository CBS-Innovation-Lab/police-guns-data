                ORDER AFFIRMING RECOMMENDED DECISION
                       OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE


      On June 21, 2016, the United States Magistrate Judge filed with the court,
with copies to the parties, his Recommended Decision on 28 U.S.C. ยง 2255
Motion. The time within which to file objections expired on July 8, 2016, and no
objections have been filed. The Magistrate Judge notified the parties that failure
to object would waive their right to de novo review and appeal.
      It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the Magistrate
Judge is hereby ADOPTED. The pending 28 U.S.C. ยง 2255 Motion is TRANSFERRED
to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1631 and
First Circuit Rule 22.1(e). I DENY a certificate of appealability pursuant to Rule
11 of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Cases because there is no substantial
showing of the denial of a constitutional right within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.
ยง 2253(c)(2).

      SO ORDERED.

      DATED THIS 1ST DAY OF AUGUST, 2016
