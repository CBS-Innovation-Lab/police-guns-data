the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant pursuant to 18 U`S.C, § 3553(a)( l)

to rellect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the |aw, and to provide just punishment for the offense (lS U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A))
to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct (l 8 U.S C. § 3553(a}(2)(B))

to protect the public from further crimes ofthe defendant (l 8 UrS.C. § 3553(a)(2)((3))

to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner
(lS U.S.C_ § 3553(a)(2}(D))
to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants {l 8 U.SrC § 3553(21)(6))

Defendant's prior record is far less serious than what the guideline numbers reflect Moreover, his prior convictions are
counted twice- once in determining the offense level and again in establishing the criminal history catagory. Thus, a
conviction for resisting arrest results in a prescribed additional sentence of about 2 years

STATEMENT OF REASONS

VII COURT DETERMINATIONS OF RESTITUTION
A m Restitutlon Not App|icable.
B Total Amount of Restitution:

C Rcstitution not ordered (Checl< only one.):

l m For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U`S.C § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 UlS.C. § 3663A(c}(3)(A)\

2 [:] For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S_C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount ofthe victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U‘S.C_ § 3663A(c)(3)(13).
3 I:] l-`or other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C_ § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelincs, restitution is not
ordered because the complication and prolongation ofthe sentencing process resulting from the fashioning ofa restitution order outweigh

the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U_S.C. § 3663(a)(l)(13)(ii)_

4 |:] Restitution is not ordered for other reasons (Explain.)
