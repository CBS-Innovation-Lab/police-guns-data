                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 12-cr-17-PB

Derek Kucinski


                                  O R D E R


     This case is currently scheduled for trial on July 9, 2013.

The defendant now moves through counsel for a continuance,

citing the need for additional time to properly prepare for

trial in light of counsel’s other trial obligations and the

location of defendant which affects counsel’s ability to meet

with him to prepare a defense.         The government does not object

to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reasons and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court agrees

to continue the trial from July 9, 2013 to September 4, 2013.

In agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to

18 U.S.C.A. ' 3161(h)(7)(A) that for the above-stated reasons,

the ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh

the best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy
