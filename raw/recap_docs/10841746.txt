Dear Clerk of Court:

             Good morning. My purpose for writing is to request copies of the
following documents in my case. I am requesting a copy of my judgment and
commitment order, plea agreement, sentencing transcripts, and a current docket
sheet. Please note that I have made several unsuccessful attempts to reach
my defense attorney to get me copies of these documents. If there is any cost
or fees to get these documents, please send me the invoice and I will remit
the payment.
             Your assistance in this matter is greatly appreciated. May you
have a blessed day.


                                                Respectfully,


                                                Lionel Cole
