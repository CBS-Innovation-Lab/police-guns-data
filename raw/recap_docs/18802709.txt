                        UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                     FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE

United States of America

      v.                                   Case No. 06-CR-18-02-PB

Avery Blodgett



                                   O R D E R

      The court finds reasonable cause to believe that the

defendant may presently be suffering from a mental disease that
could affect his sentence, and with the consent of the parties,
the court commits the defendant to the custody of the Bureau of

Prisons for a period not to exceed 45 days to be placed at the
correctional facility at Ft. Devens, Massachusetts and examined
by a qualified psychiatrist.          Following such examination, the
psychiatrist shall prepare a report to be filed under seal
addressing the defendantâ€™s competency.           This report shall also
take into account any medications the defendant is currently
taking.
      SO ORDERED.
