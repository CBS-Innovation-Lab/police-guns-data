Re: U.S. V. Gonzalez, 98-CR~152-02.
Dear Judge Cerezo:

On November 15, 2001, this Court ordered that I was to pay
restitution in the amount of $25,905.00 in 60 installments dur-
ing my supervised release period.

As of this moment, the Bureau of Prisons ("B.O.P.") is requir-
ing me to immediately make payments on the Court-ordered restitu-
tion and has been threatening to put me on refusal status, which
places many restrictions on me.

I have been making payments on the restitution through the
B.O.P. as of December 14, 2004, which payments total out to
$595.62. In addition, I am being charged $4,817.96_in;interest`
by the U.S. attorney's office for restitution that I was ordered
to begin paying while on supervised release by this Honorable
Court.

This Court ordered me to pay $25,905.00, but the U.S. attor-
ney is making me pay $30,722.96 immediately while in prison. The
U.S. attorney and the B.O.P. are violating this Honorable Court's
Order.

Please see attached administrative remedy to see that I have
attempted to resolve this matter internally to no avail.

I would like to know if I am suppose to pay the $25,905.00

ordered by the Court or the $30,722.96 the U.S. attorney is
requiring me to pay due to the $4,817.96 interest. Also,r I would

like to know if the B.O.P. can make me begin payment on the resti-
tution prior to my release on supervised release. In addition, I
am requesting that the Court please send a letter or some form of
communication to my case manager at the following address, inform-
ing the B.O.P. that I do not have to pay the restitution until I
have been released on supervised release. My case manager's
address is:

I also request that the Court please send a copy of any com-
munciation in regards to this matter to me at the address listed
on page 1 of this letter.

Thank you in advance for your time and assistance in this
matter. I look forward to hearing from the Court as soon as
possible.

Respectfully reguested,

th visas
