ORDER ON MOTION FOR AN ORDER AUTHORIZING TWELVE OR MORE
    MONTHS OF RESIDENTIAL REENTRY CENTER PLACEMENT

       Even though the Court has a positive view of the efficacy of residential reentry

centers in bridging the gap from federal incarceration to the freedom of society, the

Court declines to grant an inmate’s request for a judicial recommendation to the

Bureau of Prisons to extend the Defendant’s time in halfway house placement from

six to twelve months. In recognition of the Bureau of Prisons’ superior knowledge

regarding the Defendant, the availability of halfway house placement for him, the

impact of his placement on other inmates seeking similar placement, and the

significance of his disciplinary record while incarcerated, the Court will not interfere

with the Bureau of Prisons’ assessment that six months is the proper amount of time

for the Defendant to spend in a halfway house to foster his successful reentry into

society.

I.     BACKGROUND

       On August 11, 2004, the Court sentenced David Sanford to 240 months of

incarceration, six years of supervised release, and a $400 special assessment for

engaging in a conspiracy to commit a Hobbs Act robbery, possession of a stolen

firearm, possession of a firearm by a felon and armed career criminal, and possession

of a controlled substance with intent to distribute it. J. (ECF No. 129). Mr. Sanford

appealed his convictions and sentences to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit

and on December 28, 2005, the First Circuit affirmed both the convictions and the

sentences. United States v. Sanford, 160 Fed. Appx. 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2005) (per curiam).

       In March 2021, the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) referred Mr. Sanford for

placement in a halfway house, to begin likely on March 29, 2022, six months prior to

his scheduled release date of September 29, 2022. 1 See Gov’t’s Resp. to Def.’s Mot. for

an Order Authorizing Twelve or More Months of Residential Re-Entry Center (RRC)

Placement (Gov’t’s Opp’n), Attach. 2, BOP Inst. Referral for CCC Placement (ECF No.

177). On May 13, 2021, Mr. Sanford filed a pro se motion for an order authorizing

residential reentry placement, seeking twelve, not six, months of residential reentry

placement. Mot. for an Order Authorizing Twelve or More Months of Residential

Reentry Center (RRC) Placement (ECF No. 175) (Def.’s Mot.). 2

II.    LEGAL STANDARDS

       The United States Supreme Court has written that Congress has given the

BOP “plenary control, subject to statutory constraints, over ‘the place of the prisoner’s

imprisonment.’” Tapia v. United States, 564 U.S. 319, 331 (2011) (quoting 18 U.S.C.

§ 3621(b)). Federal law permits a court to make a recommendation to the BOP, “[b]ut


1       The Government provided a BOP form entitled “Sentence Monitoring, Computation Data as of
05-19-2021.” Gov’t’s Opp’n, Attach 1, Sentence Monitoring, Computation Data as of 05-19-2021 at 1.
This form indicates that Mr. Sanford’s home detention eligibility date is March 29, 2022 and his
projected release date is September 29, 2022. Id. The Government also provided a BOP form entitled
“Institutional Referral for CCC Placement.” Gov’t’s Opp’n, Attach. 2, Institutional Referral for CCC
Placement. This form states that Mr. Sanford’s anticipated release date is September 29, 2022 but
provides a recommended date of March 29, 2022. Id. at 1.
2       Contemporaneous with this order, the Court is issuing an order on Mr. Sanford’s motion for
compassionate release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1).

                                                 2

decisionmaking authority rests with the BOP.”             Id.   The applicable statutory

provision is 18 U.S.C. § 3624(c)(1):

        [The BOP] shall, to the extent practicable, ensure that a prisoner
        serving a term of imprisonment spends a portion of the final months of
        that term (not to exceed 12 months), under conditions that will afford
        that prisoner a reasonable opportunity to adjust to and prepare for the
        reentry of that prisoner into the community. Such conditions may
        include a community correctional facility.

Federal law also provides that a sentencing court may make a recommendation that

a prisoner serve a term of imprisonment in a residential reentry center. 18 U.S.C. §

3621(b). But the recommendation has “no binding effect.” Id.

        Some sentencing courts have issued orders recommending release into a

residential reentry center. United States v. Hoskins, No. 3:01-cr-00266, 2018 U.S.

Dist. LEXIS 56466 (M.D. Pa. Apr. 3, 2018); United States v. Bhamani, No. 2:10-cr-

00327-TLN, 2017 UL 2992455, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109902 (E.D. Cal. July 13,

2017); United States v. Qadri, No. CR-06-00469-LEK, 2017 WL 1011663, 2017 U.S.

Dist. LEXIS 38716 (D. Haw. Mar. 15, 2017); United States v. Bartels, No. 12-cr-20072,

2016 WL 6956796, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 164056 (E.D. Mich. Nov. 29, 2016); United

States v. Brattin, No. 2:13-cr-0161-JAD-CWH-1, 2016 WL 4467897, 2016 U.S. Dist.

LEXIS 112222, (D. Nev. Aug. 23, 2016); United States v. Baker, No. 3:01-cr-94-01-

MHT, 2013 WL 355867, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11418 (M.D. Ala. Jan. 29, 2013).

These    courts   have   typically     emphasized   the    defendant’s   post-sentencing

rehabilitation, criminal record, and any recommendations from BOP personnel.

        Other sentencing courts have denied similar motions. United States v. Perry.

No. 2:13-cr-0049-TLN, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65226 (E.D. Cal. Apr. 27, 2017); United

States v. Landers, No. 6:09-cr-0893-10-JMC, 2013 WL 5530271, 2013 U.S. Dist.

LEXIS 144450 (D.S.C. Oct. 7, 2013); United States v. Anderson, No. 10-20437-CR-

JEM, 2012 WL 5530271, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 195841 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 1, 2012).

Often the denials are based on the sentencing court’s deference to the BOP’s superior

legal and factual position in making placement decisions, on a lack of corroborating

information, and on the timing of the motion, such as a motion made too early in an

inmate’s sentence for a court to predict his status at the end of incarceration. See

e.g., United States v. Hoskins, No. 3:01-cr-00266, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14474 at *6

(M.D. Pa. Jan. 30, 2018). On November 18, 2011, Judge Hornby of this District denied

a similar request for judicial recommendation, concluding that there was “no reason

to distinguish [the defendant] from other inmates whom the [BOP] must assign in

accordance with the criteria Congress has given it.” United States v. Smith, No. 2:10-

cr-00154-JDL, Order on Def.’s Mot. for Judicial Recommendation to BOP at 1 (ECF

No. 34) (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3621(b)).

      This Court has issued four opinions on similar motions. United States v. Sirois,

No. 1:11-cr-206-JAW, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 175207 (D. Me. Oct. 11, 2018); United

States v. Stile, No. 1:11-cr-00185-JAW, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150648 (D. Me. Sept.

5, 2018); United States v. Ford, No. 1:12-cv-00163-JAW-4, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS

107304 (D. Me. June 25, 2018); United States v. Sutherland, No. 1:15-cv-00041-JAW,

2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104596 (D. Me. June 22, 2018). It granted three and dismissed

one. These motions are fact intensive. The motion the Court denied, for example,

involved a defendant who lied on the witness stand in two jury trials and received an



                                          4

obstruction of justice enhancement. Ford, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107304, at *6-7.

The Court was reluctant to accept her word about her progress in prison absent

corroboration. Id. In the other three cases, the Court recommended to the BOP that

the inmate be assigned to a residential reentry center but expressly acknowledged

the BOP’s greater expertise in making the ultimate decision.

III.   DISCUSSION

       The primary basis for the Court’s reluctance to make a recommendation to the

BOP in Mr. Sanford’s case is that the issue, as narrowly presented, is not whether

the BOP should grant Mr. Sanford a period in a residential reentry center, but how

long he should remain in the residential reentry center before being released into

society. The length of time an inmate should reside in a reentry center after a period

of incarceration seems to this Court to fall more squarely within the BOP’s

penological expertise than within this Court’s judicial experience. In addition, the

BOP has at all times many inmates eligible for assignment to residential reentry

centers and how the BOP applies the statutory criteria of 18 U.S.C. § 3621(b) among

its inmates and designates them for placement in specific residential reentry centers

are matters within the BOP’s institutional expertise and statutory authority.

       Also, even though the Court recalls Mr. Sanford, primarily from his sentencing

hearings in 2004, the Court has not seen him for over seventeen years. No doubt now

at age fifty, Mr. Sanford has changed since his early thirties when he came before

this Court, and the Court is uncomfortable applying its remote encounter with Mr.




                                          5
Case 1:03-cr-00053-JAW Document 190 Filed 09/23/21 Page 6 of 9          PageID #: 743




Sanford to his current situation.    By contrast, the BOP has been his custodian

throughout this time and its knowledge of Mr. Sanford is current.

      In its response to Mr. Sanford’s motion, the Government filed a copy of Mr.

Sanford’s BOP disciplinary record. Gov’t’s Opp’n, Attach. 3, Inmate Discipline Data

at 1-13. Mr. Sanford’s disciplinary record is not clean. It begins on December 12,

2005 with use of alcohol or drugs and ends on December 4, 2020, again with use of

alcohol or drugs. Id. The discipline record runs a little more than twelve pages. Id.

The Court finds it difficult to evaluate the significance of Mr. Sanford’s disciplinary

record and its implications for his period in the residential reentry center and defers

to the BOP on this issue.

      In its response to Mr. Sanford’s companion motion for release under 18 U.S.C.

§ 3582(c)(1)(A), the Government also brought to the Court’s attention Mr. Sanford’s

long history of drug addiction and his refusal (despite three BOP offers) to engage in

the BOP’s 500-hour Residential Drug Abuse Program (RDAP). Gov’t’s Opp’n to Def.’s

Am. Mot. for Compassionate Release at 5-7 (ECF No. 188).            From the Court’s

viewpoint, it would be reassuring, given his acknowledged issues with addiction, if

Mr. Sanford had successfully completed RDAP. Again, the BOP, not this Court, is

better able to evaluate what, if anything, Mr. Sanford’s decision to decline

participation in RDAP means for his release to twelve-months in a residential reentry

center.

      Certainly, not all of Mr. Sanford’s time in prison has been for naught. In 2004,

Mr. Sanford struck the Court as intelligent and literate, and the Court is impressed



                                          6
Case 1:03-cr-00053-JAW Document 190 Filed 09/23/21 Page 7 of 9          PageID #: 744




with his enrollment in courses of all types during the last nearly eight years of his

period of incarceration. Gov’t’s Opp’n., Attach. 4, Inmate Educ. Data at 1-2.

      Finally, in his motion for compassionate release, Mr. Sanford attached a letter

dated July 1, 2021 from Anthony Scibelli, Assistant Superintendent of the Western

Massachusetts Recovery and Wellness Center (WMRWC) operated by the Hampden

County Sheriff’s Department.     Mr. Scibelli indicates that WMRWC is a federal

residential reentry center, that it operates treatment programs for substance abuse

disorders, and that it would have a bed available for Mr. Sanford. Def.’s Am. Mot. for

Compassionate Release, Attach. 2, Letter from Anthony Scibelli to Hon. John A.

Woodcock, Jr. (Jul. 1, 2021)) (ECF No. 187). The Court appreciates Mr. Scibelli’s offer

to assist Mr. Sanford in his transition from federal prison to society. Nevertheless,

in the context of this case, the WMRWC option would short-circuit the BOP process

and, if the Court ordered Mr. Sanford’s release to WMRWC, it would contravene the

statutory authority of the BOP under § 3624(c)(1) to make the decision about where

and when to place Mr. Sanford.

      To place this proposal in its broader context, Mr. Sanford repeatedly declined

to participate in the BOP’s RDAP, which is designed for inmates with substance

abuse problems nearing the end of their incarceration. The BOP has preliminarily

indicated that it will assign Mr. Sanford to a residential reentry center during the

last six months of his prison term. If the Court were to grant Mr. Sanford’s request

to be assigned to WMRWC, the net effect would be to reward him for refusing to

participate in RDAP and release him earlier than BOP has planned, to a program of



                                          7
Case 1:03-cr-00053-JAW Document 190 Filed 09/23/21 Page 8 of 9          PageID #: 745




Mr. Sanford’s choosing outside of prison during the six months leading up to the point

when the BOP is scheduled to release him to a residential reentry center. Section

3624(c)(1) charges the BOP, not Mr. Sanford, with the authority to decide when and

where to release inmates like Mr. Sanford. The BOP’s decision about when and where

to release an inmate is presumably multifactorial, involving its allocation of limited

resources, its responsibility to place other equally deserving inmates, and similar

factors. In these circumstances, the Court will not make a recommendation to the

BOP that would undercut BOP’s exercise of its lawful placement authority.

      This decision is not a comment on WMRWC and the quality of its program. It

may turn out that the BOP elects to use WMRWC as a residential reentry center for

Mr. Sanford beginning on March 29, 2022, and if so, the Court would have no

objection. This order is only about who gets to decide this issue and the Court has

determined it is the BOP who decides.

      For reasons both statutory and practical, the Court declines to make a

recommendation in Mr. Sanford’s case to the BOP for a period in a residential reentry

center beyond the six-month period the BOP itself has authorized. In sum, in Mr.

Sanford’s case, the Court concludes that the BOP is better able than the Court to

assess his current suitability for a halfway house and to prioritize him for placement

among its inmate population.
