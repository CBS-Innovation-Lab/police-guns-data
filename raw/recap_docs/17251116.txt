to refleet the seriousness of the olfense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense (18 U.S C, § 3553(a)(2)(A))
to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct (l 8 U.S.C. § 3553(a}(2)(B))

to protect the public from further crimes ofthe defendant (] 8 U.S.C. § 3553(3)(2)((1))

to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical eare, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner

(18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(D))

i:l to provide restitution to any victims ofthe offense (18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(7))

EEEEE

D Explain the facts justifying a sentence outside the advisory guideline system. (UseSection VIII il'necessary.)

The guidelines regime resulted in an unfairly high sentence in this case. Defendant's prior conviction for resisting arrest
resulted in both an increase of six levels in his offense score and in the Criminal History Category. This is because the First
Circuit has decided that resisting arrest is a crime of violence regardless of the underlying facts. The sentence imposed takes
account of the underlying facts.

STATEMENT OF REASONS

VII COURT DETERMINAT]ONS OF RESTITUTION
A m Restitution Not Applicable.
B Total Amount of Restitutlon:

C Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

l i:] For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

2 l:] For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
issues ot' fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burdcn on the scntencing process under 18 U.S.C, § 3663A(c)(3)(B).
3 l:i For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U,S.C. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing giiide|ines, restitution is not
ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh

thc need to provide restitution to any victims under 13 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(1){B)(ii).

4 m Restitution is not ordcred for other reasons (Explain,)

D l:] Partial restitution is ordered for these reasons (18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)):
