              ORDER ON MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
              AND MOTION FOR COMPASSIONATE RELEASE

      Defendant Theodore Sealy has filed a motion seeking reconsideration of my

earlier order denying his request for compassionate release and bringing a new

request for compassionate release (“Def.’s Mot.”) (ECF No. 196). For the reasons

stated below, the Defendant’s motion is DENIED.


                                  BACKGROUND

      On August 3, 2016, Mr. Sealy pleaded guilty to Count One of the Superseding

Indictment, conspiracy to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute cocaine

base, oxycodone, and heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and 846.

Superseding Indictment (ECF No. 55); Minute Entry (ECF No. 70). On March 6, 2017,

I sentenced him to eighty-four months imprisonment, followed by five years of

supervised release. Judgment (ECF No. 159).

      Mr. Sealy served the first half of his sentence in prison before being moved by

the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) to home confinement on October 28, 2020, due to his

medical conditions and the increased risk of COVID-19 in an institutional setting.

Def.’s Emergency Mot. for Compassionate Release and Reduction of Sentence from

Home Confinement to Time Served (“Def.’s First Mot.”) 1 (ECF No. 187). On

December 29, 2021, the Defendant filed a motion seeking compassionate release,

meaning a release from home confinement. Def.’s First Mot. The primary basis for

that motion was that the Defendant contended he could not adequately treat his

medical conditions while on home confinement because of the strictures of

supervision that that punishment entails. Def.’s First Mot. 1–3; First Decl. of

Theodore Sealy (“First Sealy Decl.”) 1–2 (ECF No. 187-1). Specifically, he took issue

with the requirement that he receive advance approval for medical appointments and

procedures, which he said did not allow him to be put on wait lists for specialist

appointments and procedures and had delayed the diagnosis and treatment of his

ongoing health issues. First Sealy Decl. 1–2; Def.’s Reply to Gov’t’s Resp. to Def.’s

First Mot. 4 (ECF No. 194).

      On February 8, 2022, I denied the motion, finding that the purported

deficiencies in care that Mr. Sealy had identified were illusory and that he had thus

failed to establish an extraordinary and compelling reason justifying his release.

Order on Mot. for Compassionate Release (“Feb. Order”) 8–11 (ECF No. 195). In

denying his motion, it was also an important aspect of my decision that Mr. Sealy

was “not in a carceral environment where he would be unable to mitigate his risk of

infection.” Feb. Order 6.

      Sixteen days after I issued my order, the Defendant filed a motion that he

characterized as a “Motion for Reconsideration and Renewed Emergency Motion for




                                         2
Case 2:16-cr-00036-NT Document 203 Filed 05/13/22 Page 3 of 10           PageID #: 1550




Compassionate Release and Reduction of Sentence.” Def.’s Mot. The impetus for this

motion was that—unbeknownst to me and to counsel—in the weeks prior to the

issuance of my February order, Mr. Sealy had had his home confinement revoked and

had been returned to prison. Def.’s Mot. 1–2; Def.’s Reply to Gov’t’s Obj. to Def.’s Mot.

1–2 (“Def.’s Reply”) (ECF No. 198). The parties dispute the circumstances

surrounding Mr. Sealy’s return to custody and the validity of the revocation of his

home confinement. The Defendant has emphasized “that he is not asking this Court

to adjudicate the [propriety of his] remand to the halfway house and to prison.” Def.’s

Status Report Regarding Def.’s Mot. (“Def.’s Status Report”) 2 (ECF No. 200). And,

as I explain in greater detail below, because Mr. Sealy’s risk of infection under the

current circumstances appears low (and thus release is unwarranted), I find it

unnecessary to delve into the details of this dispute.

      After the Defendant filed his second motion (the motion now before me), the

Government objected to my consideration of the motion without requiring Mr. Sealy

to exhaust his administrative remedies. Gov’t’s Obj. to Def.’s Mot. (ECF No. 197). The

Defendant responded that, although he did not believe exhaustion was required, he

had already begun the process to exhaust his administrative remedies. Def.’s Reply

2–4. I thus held Mr. Sealy’s motion in abeyance to wait for this exhaustion to be

complete. Order (ECF No. 199). Mr. Sealy has now exhausted his administrative

remedies, the parties have filed supplemental briefing (Def.’s Status Report; Gov’t’s

Resp. to Def.’s Status Report (ECF No. 201); Def.’s Reply Regarding Def.’s Status

Report (ECF No. 202)), and the Defendant’s motion is ripe for my review.

                                            ANALYSIS

        Congress enacted the compassionate release statute1 to allow district courts to

modify sentences of imprisonment, as relevant here, upon finding that:

(1) extraordinary and compelling reasons warrant modification, (2) the modification

accords with the § 3553(a) sentencing factors, and (3) the modification is consistent

with “applicable policy statements” of the Sentencing Guidelines. I focus here on the

question of whether there exist extraordinary and compelling reasons warranting Mr.

Sealy’s release.

        The compassionate release statute itself does not define what constitutes an

“extraordinary and compelling reason[ ]” justifying a sentence modification. United

States v. Canales-Ramos, 19 F.4th 561, 566 (1st Cir. 2021); see 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c).

However, the United States Sentencing Commission has done so in the Commentary



1       Title 18, United States Code, Section 3582(c)(1)(A) governs “[m]odification of an imposed term
of imprisonment.” Prior to the passage of the First Step Act of 2018, only the Director of the Bureau of
Prisons (“BOP”) could move for modification of a sentence. See United States v. Ruvalcaba, 26 F.4th
14, 17 (1st Cir. 2022). In December of 2018, Congress amended § 3582(c) to allow inmates to seek a
modification of an imposed term of imprisonment from the courts directly. See First Step Act of 2018,
Pub. L. No. 115-391, § 603(b), 132 Stat. 5194, 5239 (codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A)). Section 3582
now provides that:

        The court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except
        that—(1) in any case—(A) the court, upon motion of the Director of the Bureau of
        Prisons, or upon motion of the defendant after the defendant has fully exhausted all
        administrative rights to appeal a failure of the Bureau of Prisons to bring a motion on
        the defendant’s behalf or the lapse of 30 days from the receipt of such a request by the
        warden of the defendant’s facility, whichever is earlier, may reduce the term of
        imprisonment (and may impose a term of probation or supervised release with or
        without conditions that does not exceed the unserved portion of the original term of
        imprisonment), after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent
        that they are applicable, if it finds that—(i) extraordinary and compelling reasons
        warrant such a reduction . . . and that such a reduction is consistent with applicable
        policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission . . . .

18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A).

to its policy statement on compassionate release, located at § 1B1.13 of the sentencing

guidelines. In discussing medical-based reasons, the Commission notes that

extraordinary and compelling reasons exist where:

             (i)    The defendant is suffering from a terminal illness (i.e., a
                    serious and advanced illness with an end of life trajectory).
                    A specific prognosis of life expectancy (i.e., a probability of
                    death within a specific time period) is not required.
                    Examples include metastatic solid-tumor cancer,
                    amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), end-stage organ
                    disease, and advanced dementia.

             (ii)   The defendant is —

                    (I)     suffering from a serious physical or medical
                            condition,
                    (II)    suffering from a serious functional or cognitive
                            impairment, or
                    (III)   experiencing deteriorating physical or mental
                            health because of the aging process,

                    that substantially diminishes the ability of the defendant
                    to provide self-care within the environment of a
                    correctional facility and from which he or she is not
                    expected to recover.
             ....

Id. § 1B1.13 Commentary n.1. The Commentary addresses age-based and family-

based reasons in subdivisions (B) and (C), and then provides in subdivision (D):

“Other Reasons.—As determined by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, there

exists in the defendant’s case an extraordinary and compelling reason other than, or

in combination with, the reasons described in subdivisions (A) through (C).” Id.

§ 1B1.13.

      The Defendant does not argue that subdivision (A), (B), or (C) applies. Instead,

he argues that he has “other” extraordinary and compelling reasons that warrant the



                                           5
Case 2:16-cr-00036-NT Document 203 Filed 05/13/22 Page 6 of 10          PageID #: 1553




application of subdivision (D). By its terms, subdivision (D) only allows the Director

of the BOP to consider whether “other” extraordinary and compelling reasons exist.

However, this limitation predates Congress’s enactment of the First Step Act, which

granted incarcerated individuals the right to file motions for compassionate release

in the event that the BOP declined or delayed doing so. United States v. Saccoccia, 10

F.4th 1, 3–4, 7 (1st Cir. 2021). Because the Sentencing Commission has lacked a

quorum for the last several years, it has not yet had the opportunity to consider how

the implementation of the First Step Act might affect its policy guidance in § 1B1.13.

Id. at 7. As a result, this out-of-date policy statement is not currently applicable to

prisoner-initiated motions. United States v. Ruvalcaba, 26 F.4th 14, 21 (1st Cir.

2022). And it is currently the case that “district courts—when adjudicating prisoner-

initiated motions for compassionate release—have discretion, unconstrained by any

policy statement currently in effect, to consider whether a prisoner’s particular

reasons are sufficiently extraordinary and compelling to warrant compassionate

release.” Id. at 23. Although, the current policy statement may still “serve as a non-

binding reference.” Id.

      This does not mean that I have unbounded discretion in evaluating whether

the Defendant has put forward an extraordinary and compelling reason justifying his

release. In particular, his asserted justification for why compassionate release is

warranted must truly be “extraordinary” and “compelling.” See id. A reason is

“extraordinary” if it “is beyond the mine-run either in fact or in degree.” Canales-




                                          6
Case 2:16-cr-00036-NT Document 203 Filed 05/13/22 Page 7 of 10                    PageID #: 1554




Ramos, 19 F.4th at 566. Meanwhile, a “compelling” reason is one “that is both

powerful and convincing.” Id. at 567.

       The Defendant primarily relies on his medical conditions and need for

treatment as a justification for his sentence reduction. “[B]ut not every complex of

health concerns is sufficient to warrant compassionate release. This remains true

even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.” Saccoccia, 10 F.4th at 5. It is only if

“the defendant’s situation constitutes the type of ‘extreme hardship’ that the

compassionate-release statute is designed to ameliorate” that a sentence reduction is

warranted. Id. at 4.

       There is no dispute that the Defendant has a litany of medical conditions,

which he has substantiated with medical records. Def.’s First Mot. 2; Medical Records

(ECF No. 188-1). At least one of these conditions (asthma) is known to be a preexisting

condition that can make it more likely for someone “to get very sick with COVID-19.”

See Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease),

People with Certain Medical Conditions,” https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-

ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html (last visited May

13, 2022).2 The Government has not challenged the Defendant’s evidence of his poor

health, and, indeed, the BOP previously found that Mr. Sealy was sick enough that



2        The Defendant asserted in his original motion (“Def.’s First. Mot.”) that he is
“immunocompromised.” Def.’s First Mot. 8 (ECF No. 187). The Government points out that he has
failed to identify which of his conditions purportedly makes him immunocompromised. Gov’t’s Obj. to
Def.’s First Mot. 4 (ECF No. 192). While it remains unclear why Mr. Sealy believes he is
immunocompromised, it may be related to his undiagnosed autoimmune disorder, which he says
remains undiagnosed at least in part because the BOP has put him back into custody. I assume for
the sake of this Order that Mr. Sealy is immunocompromised.



                                                7
Case 2:16-cr-00036-NT Document 203 Filed 05/13/22 Page 8 of 10           PageID #: 1555




it considered it appropriate to release him to home confinement pursuant to the

CARES Act. Gov’t’s Obj. to Def.’s First Mot. 4 n.5 (ECF No. 192); see Memorandum

from the Att’y Gen. to the Dir. of Bureau Prisons 1–2 (Mar. 26, 2020), available at

https://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/docs/bop_memo_home_confinement.pdf            (directing

BOP to evaluate whether “some at-risk inmates who are non-violent and pose

minimal likelihood of recidivism and who might be safer serving their sentences in

home confinement” should be released to home confinement).

       But while Mr. Sealy may be medically more susceptible to a severe case of

COVID-19, this, of course, is only relevant to the extent he is put in a situation where

he is at an elevated risk of contracting the virus. It does not appear that he is in such

a situation. I recognize that cases have been ticking up across the country, and, as

the Defendant notes, on May 2, 2022, Lewisburg USP (the facility where Mr. Sealy is

incarcerated) increased its operational level to a Level 3. Def.’s Reply Regarding Def.’s

Status Report 2. This change was made “due to a high community transmission rate

of COVID-19 within the local area” of the prison. May 2, 2022, Notice to Inmate

Population (ECF No. 202-2). However, what has not changed are the case counts

inside the walls of Lewisburg itself. As of April 28, 2022, Lewisburg was reporting

zero COVID-19 cases among inmates or staff. Gov’t’s Resp. to Def.’s Status Report 4.

That    remains     true    today.    Bureau      of   Prisons,    COVID-19       Cases,

https://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/ (last visited May 13, 2022). In other words, while

cases are increasing in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, so far, the BOP has been doing an

adequate job of keeping cases out of the prison. So, I have no reason to conclude that

Case 2:16-cr-00036-NT Document 203 Filed 05/13/22 Page 9 of 10                         PageID #: 1556




Mr. Sealy’s health is in jeopardy at this time, and I find that the Defendant is unable

to establish an extraordinary and compelling reason justifying his release. See United

States v. Baptiste-Harris, Docket No. 2:18-cr-00127-NT-1, 2021 WL 1583081, at *3

(Apr. 22, 2021) (“[W]hatever risk of reinfection that might exist is mitigated by the

existence of so few infections at Mr. Baptiste-Harris’s facility.”); United States v.

Greene, Docket No. 1:17-cr-00012-NT-1, 2020 WL 4475892 (D. Me. Aug. 4, 2020), at

*4 (“The decreasing number of infections at FMC Devens also weighs against a

finding that extraordinary and compelling circumstances warrant release.”).3

        While the level of infections at Mr. Sealy’s place of incarceration is an

important factor in evaluating whether he has put forward an extraordinary and

compelling reason justifying release (and in this case it is dispositive), I recognize

that it is volatile. Should the circumstances change (e.g., if the case numbers at

Lewisburg precipitously increase or if Mr. Sealy is moved to a facility with elevated

case numbers), the Defendant is free to renew his motion.




3        The Defendant and the Government squabble over a few additional issues, including who is at
fault for the Defendant remaining unvaccinated. I have previously noted that a defendant’s decision
to decline vaccination against medical recommendations weighs against granting a motion for
compassionate release premised on the risks of a severe COVID-19 infection. See United States v.
Baptiste-Harris, Docket No. 2:18-cr-00127-NT-1, 2021 WL 1583081, at *2 (Apr. 22, 2021) (“Mr.
Baptiste-Harris is not free to pick and choose the medical recommendations he wishes to follow. He
cannot, on the one hand, listen to the Centers for Disease Control’s advice about who is most at risk of
serious illness, but then ignore the same agency’s advice to get a vaccine.”). But here, Mr. Sealy asserts
that he has attempted to get a medical recommendation as to whether he should get vaccinated despite
his undiagnosed autoimmune disorder but that BOP has not responded. Accordingly, I do not hold Mr.
Sealy’s unvaccinated status against him, and I encourage him to keep trying to get an opinion on
whether he should receive the vaccination given his condition.

                                 CONCLUSION

      For the foregoing reasons, the Defendant’s motion for compassionate release is

 DENIED without prejudice.
