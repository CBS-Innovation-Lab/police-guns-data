              1                  (Court commenced at 2:12.)

              2

              3              THE CLERK: This is Criminal Case 04-30055-map,

              4       the United States versus Kacey Jones.

              5              THE COURT: We are here this afternoon for the

              6       sentencing of the defendant, Kacey Jones, following his

              7       plea of guilty to one count of distribution and

              8       possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, also

              9       known as crack cocaine.

            10            I understand after this sentencing that the

            11        government's intention is to move to dismiss Counts 2, 3,

            12        4 and 5 of the indictment.

            13            I would like to begin by just noting what I have

            14        reviewed in preparation for today's sentencing hearing.

            15        I've, of course, read the presentence report.

            16            I have read with great interest and great respect

            17        the extraordinarily loving letters that have been
            18        submitted in support of Mr. Jones here by the defendant's

            19        mother, Rosalyn Bryant; the defendant's nephew, Shamod

            20        Jones; his sister, Rosalyn Washington; his sister,

            21        Tiffiny Jones, and Mavarius Jones, the defendant's

            22        nephew.

            23            These letters are really a testament to what a

            24        loving and supportive group of family members Mr. Jones

            25        has, and I assume that some of the people whose names

              1       I've just read are here in the courtroom today to show

              2       their support for Mr. Jones. Those are the letters that

              3       I've read.

              4           The sentencing, for better or worse, is quite

              5       straightforward here this afternoon. I understand there

              6       have been no objections filed to the presentence report

              7       by either side. And hearing that I'm not incorrect from

              8       anyone, I want the record to reflect that, there being no

              9       objections, I incorporate into this sentencing proceeding

            10        all of the details of the presentence report.

            11            I don't feel it necessary to recite every single

            12        detail of the presentence report. I have, however, read

            13        the presentence report very carefully, and I have all of

            14        its specifics in mind as I go forward with my sentencing

            15        responsibility here today.

            16            Most particularly, I have in mind that this is a

            17        plea and sentencing proceeding subject to the provisions
            18        of Rule 11(e), in which both the government and the

            19        defense entered into an agreement for a particular

            20        sentence and that particular sentence is 120 months or

            21        ten years in prison.

            22            That's a tough sentence for anyone to have to serve,

            23        but I can't help observe or note that it represents a

            24        terrific job of advocacy by Mr. Mastroianni and a

            25        willingness on the part of the government to negotiate

              1       with generosity and flexibility with defense counsel.

              2           The charges in -- the original five group of

              3       charges, if the defendant had gone to trial and had been

              4       found guilty, he would have been facing a sentence of at

              5       least twenty years. There is no discretion on my part.

              6           There was a fifteen-year minimum-mandatory sentence,

              7       plus a five-year sentence that was on and after that

              8       which was mandatory. I wouldn't have had any discretion.

              9       That would have been twenty years if the defendant had

            10        been found guilty of the five offenses he was charged

            11        with.

            12            The Sentencing Guidelines I haven't calculated them

            13        but I understand they would have been higher than the

            14        twenty years. So the defendant was looking at the

            15        potential of a sentence that would really almost be a

            16        life-extinguishing sentence in terms of the number of

            17        years that Mr. Jones would have had to go away for.
            18            Instead, although this is a tough sentence and a

            19        heavy sentence, the sentence does give Mr. Jones some

            20        hope and the existence of the family members, who care so

            21        much for him, gives him even greater hope I hope.

            22            Mr. Jones just turned 26 back in August. This

            23        sentence -- the defendant has already been in custody a

            24        little over two years. With good time, he may be out in

            25        seven years or so and will still be a young man with a

              1       great deal of his life ahead of him, and I hope that Mr.

              2       Jones is able to enjoy his loved ones and pick up with

              3       his life once this sentence is over.

              4           Certainly as I was considering whether to approve

              5       this sentence, which is despite being ten years a

              6       relatively modest sentence for the sorts of offenses that

              7       Mr. Jones was looking at, I was impressed by the letters.

              8       They really made a difference to me because they showed

              9       that there's a big side of Mr. Jones that isn't described

            10        in his criminal record but is part of his personality as

            11        a generous and helpful person who really cares for his

            12        family members.

            13            I really think that once this sentence is behind

            14        him, I really hope, Mr. Jones, you'll get a chance to

            15        enjoy that side of life for the rest of your life.

            16            I'm talking for too long but this is not an easy

            17        situation. I don't know that there's really too much to
            18        be said. I am going to accept the plea agreement here,

            19        and it is my inclination to impose the sentence that both

            20        the government and the defense have agreed upon, unless

            21        there's something that I hear over the next few minutes

            22        that makes me change my mind.

            23            I'll hear first Mr. Smyth and then Mr. Mastroianni,

            24        and, Mr. Jones, then if you wish to say something before

            25        I make my final decision, I'd be happy to hear anything

              1       you have to say.

              2           Mr. Smyth.

              3              MR. SMYTH:         Your Honor, briefly I would ask

              4       you to impose the sentence agreed upon recommendation.

              5       We did have some obstacles with our case and the

              6       defendant did have some exposure, some serious exposure.

              7       As you have outlined, I think this is a fair resolution

              8       to the case. I'd ask you to impose the 120 months'

              9       incarceration and order forfeiture of $490 and supervised

            10        release for three years. Thank you.

            11               THE COURT: Mr. Mastroianni, did you want to

            12        say anything?

            13               MR. MASTROIANNI: Briefly, Your Honor. We

            14        would ask you to accept the agreed recommendation. We

            15        would ask you to find the defendant lacks the ability to

            16        pay any fine.

            17            We would also -- or I would add just two footnotes
            18        that the defendant wants me to bring to the court's

            19        attention. Number one, he feels that he may be aggrieved

            20        by a finding by the Bureau of Prisons relative to credit

            21        for time served.

            22            You noted that he had been held for over two years.

            23        Kind of mixed throughout that two years were various

            24        state court issues that --

            25               THE COURT: I see.

              1              MR. MASTROIANNI: -- had him held, and he is

              2       quite concerned that he will get an unfavorable

              3       determination from the Bureau of Prisons regarding what

              4       that credit is, and he simply wants to make a record of

              5       that, should he seek some judicial relief down the road

              6       that he's raised that issue.

              7           He's also asked me to indicate to the court that it

              8       would be his preference, if you should choose to

              9       recommend a facility, that he be designated to Fort Dix,

            10        Your Honor.

            11               THE COURT: What state is Fort Dix in?

            12               PROBATION OFFICER: New Jersey.

            13               THE COURT: I have no problem making the

            14        recommendation.

            15               MR. MASTROIANNI: Thank you, Your Honor.

            16               THE COURT: I want the record to reflect that

            17        nothing in this proceeding would in any way limit the
            18        defendant's ability to object to any calculation of good

            19        time made by the Bureau of Prions. I don't calculate it.

            20        It's not part of my job. I just impose the sentence and

            21        then the Bureau of Prisons goes through its process.

            22            I'm not sure what the rights of a defendant are to

            23        protest the method by which the calculation of good time

            24        is done, but I have no opinion on that, and whatever

            25        rights the defendant has with regard to that have been

              1       saved.

              2           I notice here on the presentence report -- everybody

              3       notices. It's right on the front page of the presentence

              4       report -- that there is a portion of the time here that

              5       the defendant has been in custody starting in March of

              6       2004, which at least on the face of the presentence

              7       report indicates that he was serving an unrelated state

              8       sentence.

              9           That's something that the Bureau of Prisons is going

            10        to have to work out. I have no opinion about it one way

            11        or another, and, as I say, it's not part of my job to

            12        make those decisions. The defendant should be entitled

            13        to whatever amount of credit he's entitled to, whatever

            14        that may be, against the sentence that I'm about to

            15        impose.

            16            I certainly will make the recommendation of Fort

            17        Dix, and I will also decline to impose a fine based upon
            18        the defendant's financial condition.

            19            Mr. Jones, you have a right to speak if you wish to

            20        before I make my final decision. You don't have to feel

            21        as though you have to speak. I'm not going to hold it

            22        against you if you don't speak, but if you would like to

            23        say something, I'd be happy to hear anything you have to

            24        say.

              3              THE COURT: All right. Very good.

              4           Here is the sentence then that I'm going to impose.

              5       It is as follows: Pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act

              6       of 1984, and having considered the sentencing factors

              7       enumerated at 18 U.S. Code Section 3553(A), and also

              8       having considered the plea agreement and the fact that

              9       this plea agreement is under the provisions of Rule 11(e)

            10        of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, I accept the

            11        agreement between the government and the defense with

            12        regard to the appropriate sentence.

            13            It is now my judgment that the defendant, Kacey

            14        Jones, be committed to the custody of the Bureau of

            15        Prisons to be imprisoned for a term of 120 months.

            16            I do make a recommendation that the defendant serve

            17        this sentence in the facility in Fort Dix, New Jersey. I
            18        also recommend that the defendant participate in

            19        counseling programs, including anger management, if

            20        available, at the facility that the Bureau of Prisons

            21        eventually designates him to.

            22            Upon release from imprisonment, the defendant will

            23        be placed on supervised release for a term of three

            24        years. Within 72 hours of release from custody of the

            25        Bureau of Prisons, the defendant shall report in person

              1       to the district to which he is released.

              2           I am not going to impose any fine because I find

              3       that the defendant lacks the financial resources to pay

              4       any such fine, and I am also going to order the

              5       forfeiture of -- is it $490?

              6              MR. SMYTH: Yes, Your Honor.

              7              THE COURT: -- $490 that was seized from the

              8       defendant as part of the investigation.

              9           There are certain conditions of supervised release

            10        which Mr. Jones will have to follow during his three

            11        years of supervised release. First, he shall not commit

            12        any other federal, state, or local crime.

            13            Next, he shall refrain from any illegal possession

            14        or unlawful use of a controlled substance. He shall

            15        submit to one drug test within 15 days of release from

            16        imprisonment and at least two periodic drug tests

            17        thereafter, which are automatic, but those periodic drug
            18        tests may go as high as 104 tests per year or twice per

            19        week if the probation office feels they are necessary.

            20            Mr. Jones will also submit to the collection of a

            21        DNA sample as directed by the probation office. The

            22        collection of this DNA sample is automatic in all federal

            23        cases at this time.

            24            Also, Mr. Jones will comply with the standard

            25        conditions that have been adopted by the court which are

              1       described at Section 5D1.3(c) of the Sentencing

              2       Guidelines and which will be set forth in detail in the

              3       written judgment.

              4           Mr. Jones is specifically prohibited from possessing

              5       any type of firearm, destructive device, or dangerous

              6       weapon.

              7           He is also to participate in a program for substance

              8       abuse counseling as directed by the probation office

              9       during his three-year period of supervised release. This

            10        program of substance abuse counseling may include testing

            11        not to exceed, as before, 104 tests per year to determine

            12        whether he has reverted to the use of drugs.

            13            The defendant will be required to contribute to the

            14        cost of this drug counseling, to the extent that he has

            15        the ability to pay for it, or to the extent that some

            16        insurer or other third party may be available to pay.

            17            I'm also going to require that the defendant during
            18        this period of supervised release participate in a

            19        mental health treatment program to include anger

            20        management as directed by the probation office.

            21            The defendant will contribute to the costs of these

            22        services again based upon his ability to pay or the

            23        availability of some insurance coverage or other

            24        third-party payment.

            25            The defendant shall use his true name and is

              1       prohibited from the use of any false identifying

              2       information which includes, but is not limited to, any

              3       aliases, false dates of birth, et cetera.

              4           I also order the defendant pay the United States a

              5       special assessment of $100 which shall be due

              6       immediately.

              7           The defendant will be remanded as before to the

              8       custody of the United States Marshal to be held by them

              9       pending designation of the facility that will be housing

            10        Mr. Jones by the Bureau of Prisons.

            11            Mr. Jones, you have a right to appeal this sentence.

            12        The fact that you have pled guilty does not deprive you

            13        of the right to appeal this sentence. If you cannot

            14        afford an attorney to assist you with an appeal, one will

            15        be appointed who will represent you and who will be paid

            16        out of public funds.

            17            I hope this sentence will in fact move the defendant
            18        through what I'm sure will be a difficult few years but

            19        will eventually get him back to his family as a young man

            20        and with a lot of his life still ahead of him.

            21            If there's nothing further, the court will be in

            22        recess.

            23               MR. MASTROIANNI: Thank you, Your Honor.

            24               THE COURT: Thank you.

            25                    (Court recessed at 2:27.)
