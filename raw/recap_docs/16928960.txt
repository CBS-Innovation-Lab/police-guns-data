            MEMORANDUM AND ORDER RE: MOTION TO SUPPRESS
                            May 18, 2006

I.    INTRODUCTION

      The defendant, Malden Battle ("Battle"), has moved to

suppress evidence obtained from a warrantless entry by police

into the apartment in which he was staying on September 2, 2004.

He has also moved to suppress evidence seized during a subsequent

search pursuant to a warrant.

      I held a suppression hearing on February 9 and 15, 2006.         As

a result of that hearing, I conclude that the motion to suppress

[docket entry #17] is DENIED.

II.   FACTUAL BACKGROUND

      Defendant Malden Battle is charged with possession of

cocaine with intent to distribute and possession by a felon of a

firearm and ammunition.     His arrest, and the present motion to

suppress, stem from a police entry into an apartment at 14 Pearl

Street, Dorchester, Massachusetts, in which he was staying on

September 2, 2004.
     Case 1:05-cr-10129-DPW Document 26 Filed 05/18/06 Page 2 of 19



     On the morning of September 2, Boston Police received a tip

from one Odemira Rosa ("Rosa") that Malden Battle was in Rosa’s

girlfriend’s apartment, and that he had a gun.        Rosa’s

girlfriend, Helena Fonseca ("Fonseca"), lived at 14 Pearl Street

with her two young children, one of whom is Rosa’s son.         Though

Rosa lived elsewhere, he had his own key and unlimited access to

14 Pearl Street, and spent significant time there.        During a

hiatus in Rosa’s and Fonseca’s relationship in the summer of

2004, however, Fonseca began seeing Battle, who occasionally

stayed with her at her apartment.

     On August 21, 2004, Rosa went to 14 Pearl Street and entered

the apartment using his own key.       Inside, he discovered Fonseca

and a man whom he later identified as Battle.       Battle confronted

Rosa with a gun, and Rosa left the apartment.

     Battle’s and Fonseca’s relationship ended after this

incident, and Fonseca told Battle that he could no longer stay at

the apartment.   Battle, however, continued to call Fonseca.

Scared by Battle’s repeated phone calls, Fonseca and her children

left the apartment and moved in temporarily with Rosa.

     On September 1, 2004, Rosa returned to 14 Pearl Street to

ensure that Battle was no longer staying there.        He entered with

his own key, and, though Battle was not in the apartment, found a

gun in a black bag in the closet.




                                   2
     Case 1:05-cr-10129-DPW Document 26 Filed 05/18/06 Page 3 of 19



     At approximately 8:30 the following morning, September 2,

2004, Rosa went to the Dorchester police station and spoke with

Officer John Teixeira, an acquaintance who speaks Cape Verdean

Creole, Rosa’s first language.     Rosa recounted to Teixeira his

discovery of the gun at 14 Pearl Street, as well as his August

21, 2004, encounter with Battle, whom he described as a black

male, six feet tall, with braids.      He also told Teixeira that,

though the apartment at 14 Pearl Street was in Helena Fonseca’s

name, Rosa paid the rent and had a key and unlimited access.          He

offered to accompany Teixeira to the apartment and open the doors

with his key.

     After speaking with Teixeira, Rosa spoke with Sergeant

Detective Paul Donovan, using Teixeira as a translator.         He told

Donovan about the man and the gun at 14 Pearl Street.         He also

informed Donovan that he had a key and unrestricted access to the

apartment.

     At approximately 10:30 am, Rosa accompanied Donovan and

Teixeira, along with six other police officers, to 14 Pearl

Street.   He opened the building door for the police and waited on

the floor below while the police proceeded to Fonseca’s

apartment.

     Sergeant Donovan knocked on the apartment door, and a man

who fit Battle’s description came into the hallway.        He




                                   3
        Case 1:05-cr-10129-DPW Document 26 Filed 05/18/06 Page 4 of 19



immediately stated that he had permission from his girlfriend to

be in the apartment.

        While Teixeira stayed with Battle in the hallway, Donovan

and other officers conducted a “protective sweep” of the

apartment.     Meanwhile, Battle called Fonseca from his cell phone,

and the police instructed her to come to the apartment.

        After the sweep, during which nothing was found, Donovan,

the other officers, and Battle entered the apartment.1           They sat

in the living room, with Battle on the couch.          After an officer

read Battle’s Miranda rights, Battle identified himself, said he

was in the process of moving out, and stated that he had already

packed some of his belongings in his car parked outside.            He then

called his attorney and stated that he did not want to speak any

more.

        The police stopped questioning Battle, but told him he

needed to leave the apartment so they could “freeze” it while

they obtained a search warrant.           As Donovan escorted Battle out

of the apartment, Officer Gerald Cahill noticed and retrieved a

gun beneath the living room couch.

        Fonseca then arrived at the apartment.        Using Teixeira as a

translator, she confirmed that the gun belonged to Battle, and



      1
        The details of the crossing of the threshold are unclear. Sergeant
Donovan testified, “I don’t know how exactly it occurred, whether I invited
him or we went back in. I believe he had a wallet and some identification, if
I recall correctly, and he was showing us that identification.” (Suppr. Hr’g
Tr. 68, 7-10, Feb. 9, 2006).

                                      4
        Case 1:05-cr-10129-DPW Document 26 Filed 05/18/06 Page 5 of 19



that she had seen him with it on prior occasions.           The police

arrested Battle, handcuffed him, and transported him to the

police station.

        Later that day, the police obtained a search warrant, using

an affidavit that included the gun found under the couch.            They

searched the apartment and Battle’s car and found another gun, a

ballistics vest, boxes of ammunition, a bag containing three

small bags of cocaine, $2,982.00 in U.S. currency, various

clothes, Battle’s personal papers and photos, and receipts in

Battle’s and Fonseca’s names.

        Battle has moved to suppress all items seized from the

apartment and the car.

III. ANALYSIS

        A.   Legal Standards

        As the Supreme Court has recently reiterated, the Fourth

Amendment provides “special protection” for the privacy of the

home.    Georgia v. Randolph, No. 04-1067, 2006 U.S. LEXIS 2498, at

*23 n.4 (Mar. 22, 2006); accord Johnson v. United States, 333

U.S. 10, 14 (1948) (“The right of officers to thrust themselves

into a home is . . . a grave concern, not only to the individual

but to a society which chooses to dwell in reasonable security

and freedom from surveillance.”).         Warrantless entries into the

home are presumptively unreasonable, unless they fall within “one

of a carefully defined set of exceptions . . . .”           Payton v. New


                                      5
     Case 1:05-cr-10129-DPW Document 26 Filed 05/18/06 Page 6 of 19



York, 445 U.S. 573, 587 (1980).        One such exception is the

voluntary consent of a party with actual or apparent authority to

give such consent; another is the presence of exigent

circumstances justifying entry.        Id.; Randolph, 2006 U.S. LEXIS

2498, at *12.   The government bears the burden of proving that a

warrantless entry is justified by an exception to the Fourth

Amendment’s warrant requirement.       Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403

U.S. 443, 455 (U.S. 1971).

     Once officers are legitimately inside a home, they may seize

evidence that is “in plain view” without a warrant.        Id. at 465.

The boundaries of the plain view doctrine are tightly drawn,

however.   Officers are prohibited from taking any action,

“unrelated to the objectives of the authorized intrusion, which

expose[] to view concealed portions of the apartment or its

contents . . . .”     Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U.S. 321, 325 (U.S.

1987).

     In the case at bar, the question of entry is the proper

focus of this Court’s analysis.        If the police were inside the

apartment at 14 Pearl Street legitimately, Cahill’s discovery of

the gun is acceptable under the “plain view” doctrine.

     B.    Standing

     Before proceeding to an analysis of the officers’ entry into

the apartment and discovery of the gun, however, it is necessary




                                   6
       Case 1:05-cr-10129-DPW Document 26 Filed 05/18/06 Page 7 of 19



to examine whether Battle has standing to make the present Fourth

Amendment challenges.

       The Supreme Court has explained that the question of

“standing” in the Fourth Amendment context is a question of

privacy expectations.     Minnesota v. Olson, 495 U.S. 91, 95 (1990)

(“[C]apacity to claim the protection of the Fourth Amendment

depends . . . upon whether the person who claims the protection

of the Amendment has a legitimate expectation of privacy in the

invaded place.").     In this case, then, did Malden Battle have a

legitimate expectation of privacy in Helena Fonseca’s apartment

on September 2, 2004?

       At the February 15, 2006, evidentiary hearing on Battle’s

motion to suppress, Fonseca testified that, on August 21, 2004,

she told Battle to leave her apartment.        She stated, “I told

Malden to go on, to go to his house, and I told him don't come

back anymore because I have two kids in this house, I don't want

you here anymore."     (Suppr. Hr’g Tr. 11, 22-25, Feb. 15, 2006).

She also testified that, on September 2, 2004, when Battle called

her from the hallway at 14 Pearl Street, she asked, "[W]hat are

you doing at my house?      I don't want you at my house. . . I

didn't tell you you could go to my house."         Id. at 12, 19-23; 13,

1-3.   Though Battle told the police when they arrived on

September 2 that he had permission to be in the apartment,

Fonseca’s sworn testimony directly contradicts this statement.


                                     7
     Case 1:05-cr-10129-DPW Document 26 Filed 05/18/06 Page 8 of 19



     On the day of the police entry into the apartment,

therefore, Battle was no longer welcome at 14 Pearl Street.           He

was no longer an invited guest, or even a “guest” at all, but

rather a trespasser who remained in the apartment after Fonseca

instructed him to leave.    The First and Second Circuits have held

that a guest who has refused to leave a home has little or no

expectation of privacy and no standing to challenge a police

entry into that home.   United States v. McCarthy, 77 F.3d 522,

535 (1st Cir. 1996) (“Moreover, McCarthy's legitimate expectation

argument is further undercut by the fact that he left the open

suitcase in Henderson's trailer after Henderson told McCarthy

that he and Hunter had to leave.”) (citing United States v.

Rahme, 813 F.2d 31, 34-35 (2d Cir. 1987) (hotel guest had no

expectation of privacy in luggage left in room when, because of

his arrest, he defaulted on rent due)).

     The Supreme Court’s reasoning in Minnesota v. Olson,

extending the Fourth Amendment’s protections to an “overnight

guest” also supports this conclusion.      In Olson, the Court

commented, “The houseguest is there with the permission of his

host, who is willing to share his house and his privacy with his

guest.”   495 U.S. at 96-99 (emphasis added).      In the case at bar,

on August 21, 2004, Fonseca revoked her permission for Battle to

occupy her apartment.   When the police arrived on September 2, he

could no longer claim an expectation of privacy at 14 Pearl


                                   8
          Case 1:05-cr-10129-DPW Document 26 Filed 05/18/06 Page 9 of 19



Street, and therefore has no standing to raise Fourth Amendment

objections to the police entry into the apartment and discovery

of the gun.

      C.       Consent

      Yet even if Battle had standing, his motion to suppress

would still fail, as Rosa’s interactions with the police

constituted third party consent to their entry into the

apartment.

      The First Circuit has explained that a third party may

permit the police to enter a home.           A court must inquire,

however, into that party’s authority:

              The authority which justifies third-party
              consent to search rests upon mutual use of
              the property by persons generally having
              joint access or control for most purposes, so
              that it is reasonable to recognize that any
              of the co-habitants has the right to permit
              the inspection in his own right and that the
              others have assumed the risk that one of
              their number might permit the common area to
              be searched.2




      2
         Courts have expanded this rule beyond “co-habitants” to include third
parties who are not residents of a home, but who nevertheless have the joint
access or control that are the linchpins of the authority analysis. See,
e.g., United States v. Broaden, No. 96-10439, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 15327 (9th
Cir. June 23, 1997) (babysitter had authority to consent to a search); United
States v. Punzo, No. 03-1075, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20684 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 19,
2004) (father had authority to consent to search of son’s home).

                                        9
      Case 1:05-cr-10129-DPW Document 26 Filed 05/18/06 Page 10 of 19



United States v. Jimenez, 419 F.3d 34, 40 (1st Cir. 2005)

(emphasis added) (citing United States v. Matlock, 415 U.S. 164,

171 n.7 (1974)).3

     A third party may have one of two types of authority to

consent: actual or apparent.       Even if a third party does not have

the joint access or control required for actual authority, a

warrantless entry may nevertheless be valid if the police

reasonably believe in that person’s authority to consent.            In

Illinois v. Rodriguez, the Supreme Court established this

doctrine of “apparent authority,” asking, “[W]ould the facts

available to the officer at the moment . . . warrant a man of

reasonable caution in the belief that the consenting party had

authority over the premises?"       497 U.S. 177, 188 (1990).

     Finally, regardless of whether a consenting person has

actual or apparent authority, the consent he or she gives must be

voluntary.    Randolph, 2006 U.S. LEXIS 2498, at *37 (discussing

the need to ensure voluntariness).


     3
        The Supreme Court’s recent opinion in Georgia v. Randolph, No. 04-
1067, 2006 U.S. LEXIS 2498, at *23 n.4 (Mar. 22, 2006), may cast doubt on the
“assumption of the risk” rationale for the third party consent doctrine. In
Randolph, the Court’s analysis hinged on the “commonly held understanding”
that one co-tenant may not consent to a search over another tenant’s
objection. Instead of focusing on the tenants’ diminished privacy expectation
in their shared space and assumption of the risk that one of their number
would consent to a search, the Court examined “widely shared social
expectations” that one tenant’s decision concerning consent cannot trump
another’s. The Court, however, confined its holding to the set of
circumstances present in the case before it: two present co-tenants, one
objecting and one consenting to a search. On its face, then, Randolph does
not overrule the line of cases concerning third party consent. The extent to
which it has undermined, or perhaps shifted, the rationale underpinning those
cases is yet to be determined.

                                     10
        Case 1:05-cr-10129-DPW Document 26 Filed 05/18/06 Page 11 of 19



        Thus, this Court must inquire into both the nature of Rosa’s

authority and the nature of his consent.

             1.     Actual or Apparent Authority

        Courts have examined multiple factors in evaluating a third

party’s actual authority to consent to police entry into a home,

including, but not limited to, present or prior residency at that

home, access to the home, possessions kept at the home, payment

of bills at the home, and relationship to the other residents of

the home.     See, e.g. United States v. Salimonu, 182 F.3d 63 (1st

Cir. 1999) (girlfriend had actual authority when she was

authorized in the defendant’s absence to move his belongings out

of his apartment); United States v. Hyson, 721 F.3d 856 (1st Cir.

1983) (third party had actual authority when he lived for five

weeks    in an apartment rented, but not occupied, by defendant);

United States v. Evans, 27 F.3d 1219, 1230 (7th Cir. 1994)

(father had actual authority when he owned a two-bay garage, paid

its utility bills, and had access to the garage bay used

exclusively by his son); United States v. Trzaska, 859 F.2d 1118

(2d Cir. 1988) (estranged wife had actual authority when she had

her husband’s apartment key and permission to allow access to

others); Punzo, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20684 (father had actual

authority when he had keys and unlimited access to son’s house in

son’s absence).




                                      11
     Case 1:05-cr-10129-DPW Document 26 Filed 05/18/06 Page 12 of 19



     Mistakes by the police in assessing these indicia of actual

authority may give rise to a finding of apparent authority.            See,

e.g., United States v. Meada, 408 F.3d 14 (1st Cir. 2005)

(estranged girlfriend had apparent authority when she kept

personal possessions in the defendant’s apartment, had lived

there recently, and could enter without the defendant); United

States v. Hudson, 405 F.3d 425 (6th Cir. 2005) (estranged

girlfriend had apparent authority when she had a child with the

defendant, had lived at his home, and had a key); United States

v. Chaidez, 919 F.2d 1193 (7th Cir. 1990) (girlfriend had

apparent authority when she spent time at the defendant’s

apartment, paid the utility and phone bills, and could allow

access to others); but see Riley v. Gray, 674 F.2d 522, 528 (6th

Cir. 1982) (no apparent authority when third party did not live

at the defendant’s apartment, was not a regular visitor, did not

have regular possession of the keys, and did not have permission

to enter when the defendant was not there); see also United

States v. Santiago, No. 04-10336, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32657 (D.

Mass. Nov. 2, 2005) ("[H]aving access to a place and even some

ownership interest in possessions within that place is

insufficient to establish actual authority.").

     In the case at bar, Rosa, Officer Teixeira, and Sergeant

Donovan all testified that Rosa told Teixeira, and later Donovan,

that he spent significant time at the 14 Pearl Street apartment.


                                   12
      Case 1:05-cr-10129-DPW Document 26 Filed 05/18/06 Page 13 of 19



(Suppr. Hr’g Tr. 8, 5-23, Feb. 9, 2006).          Teixeira testified that

Rosa told him that he “used to stay there on and off.”             Id. at

35, 19-21.    Though Rosa’s name was not on the lease, he told

Teixeira that he paid the rent.        (Suppr. Hr’g Tr. 62, 7-8, Feb.

15, 2006).    He also stated that he had the key and unrestricted

access to the apartment, and was in fact able to open the door

for the officers.     (Suppr. Hr’g Tr. 41, 18-25; 42, 1-24, Feb. 9,

2006; Suppr. Hr’g Tr. 52, 6-9, Feb. 15, 2006).

      On the basis of this testimony, I conclude that, even if

Rosa’s connections to the apartment at 14 Pearl Street did not

satisfy the actual authority test, he provided Teixeira and

Donovan with enough information to lead them reasonably to

believe that he had joint access to or control over the apartment

at 14 Pearl Street.      Rosa therefore had apparent, if not actual,

authority to consent to the warrantless entry into Fonseca’s

apartment at 14 Pearl Street, and did provide such consent.4

             2.   Voluntariness

      In order to justify the police officers’ warrantless entry,

the government must also prove that Rosa’s consent was voluntary.


      4
        Sergeant Donovan’s testimony that he did not “have permission to
conduct a search or consent to conduct a search” does not undermine this
conclusion. (Suppr. Hr’g Tr. 65, 8-10, Feb. 9, 2006). First, it is unclear
from the context to whose consent Donovan is referring: Battle’s, Fonseca’s or
Rosa’s. Second, further testimony by Donovan establishes that he did have,
and did not believe he needed, Battle’s consent to enter into and remain in
the apartment. Id. at 68, 20-25. Third, and finally, the relevant question
to this analysis is not whether the police believed they had consent to
conduct a search, but rather whether Rosa had the authority to give consent,
and had given that consent, to enter the 14 Pearl Street apartment.


                                      13
      Case 1:05-cr-10129-DPW Document 26 Filed 05/18/06 Page 14 of 19



Randolph, 2006 U.S. LEXIS 2498, at *37.          There is little

controversy surrounding this point: Rosa testified that he went

to the Dorchester police station on September 2, 2004, offered to

escort the police to 14 Pearl Street, and opened the door of his

own accord.    (Suppr. Hr’g Tr. 52, 6-21, Feb. 15, 2006).           There is

no indication in the record that Rosa’s consent to the police

entry into the apartment was anything but voluntary.

      Because Rosa had apparent, if not actual, authority to give

consent, and because his consent was voluntary, therefore, the

warrantless entry into Fonseca’s apartment was constitutional.

      D.    Plain View

      Once the police were inside the apartment, their discovery

of the gun beneath the living room couch is justified by the

“plain view” doctrine.      Cahill testified that he noticed the gun,

sitting atop a white sock, under the couch.           According to Cahill,

neither he nor any other officer moved the couch in order to

search for the gun; he merely “tilted [his] head a little down”

and saw what he recognized as “a black firearm.” (Suppr. Hr’g Tr.

68, 1-4, Feb. 15, 2006).5      The gun is therefore admissible.


      5
        Donovan testified that the couch “had been moved from the position it
had been in when the gentleman [Battle] got up from the couch.” (Suppr. Hr’g
Tr. 54, 1-7, Feb. 9, 2006). It is unclear from this testimony whether the
couch was moved as a result of Battle’s sitting on, and getting up from, it,
or whether the police moved the couch in order to retrieve the gun after
Cahill noticed it. Neither interpretation of this testimony presents the
problem of overreaching that was at issue in Olson. If the couch moved as a
result of Battle’s own movements, the gun legitimately came into Cahill’s
“plain view.” If the police moved the couch in order to retrieve the gun,
this movement does not constitute the type of search deemed unconstitutional
in Olson, but rather was part and parcel of the permissible police seizure of

                                      14

      Moreover, because the police discovered the gun in plain

view, they were also justified in using it in their affidavit in

support of the search warrant they ultimately obtained.             Though

it is true, as the defendant argues, that a search warrant may be

tainted if the police include illegally seized evidence in their

affidavit, the warrant in the case at bar, and the search

conducted pursuant to that warrant’s authority, was not so

tainted.    See United States v. Murray, 487 U.S. 533 (1988)

(discussing “tainted” warrant affidavits).

      The police entry into the apartment, their discovery of the

gun beneath the couch, and their subsequent search pursuant to a

warrant were therefore constitutional, and the evidence they

obtained is admissible.

      E.    Government’s Remaining Arguments

      Because I conclude that Battle’s motion to suppress fails on

standing, consent, and plain view grounds, a full analysis of the

government’s three remaining arguments against suppression is not

necessary.6

        The government argues in the alternative that the police were
permitted to enter the apartment to conduct a protective sweep or to “freeze”
the apartment while awaiting a search warrant. The government also contends
that a warrant was unnecessary at the time of the entry into the apartment
because the police inevitably would have discovered the gun beneath the couch
and the other items they seized.

     I will, though, briefly address the government’s “protective

sweep” argument, in order to call attention to the ways in which

police officers, and, by extension the prosecution, impermissibly

stretch this “carefully defined” exception to the Fourth

Amendment’s warrant requirement.          Payton, 445   U.S. at 587; see

also United States v. Matthews, No. 05-10073, 2006 U.S. Dist.

LEXIS 7701, at *2 (D. Mass. Mar. 1, 2006) (noting that police

“invoked words like ‘protective sweep’ and ‘exigent

circumstances’ to justify their search, but these phrases are

meaningless mantras unless they are connected to supporting

facts”).

             1.   Protective Sweep

     Sergeant Donovan testified, and the government argued, that

the officers’ initial, warrantless entry into the 14 Pearl Street

apartment was necessary in order to perform a protective sweep,

carried out to ensure the officers’ safety.         On the facts of this

case, however, the protective sweep justification does not apply.

Officers may conduct a protective sweep of a home under a limited

set of circumstances.    First, their entry into the home must be

constitutional.    United States v. Martins, 413 F.3d 139, 150 (1st

Cir. 2005)    (“[P]olice who have lawfully entered a residence

possess the same right to conduct a protective sweep whether an

arrest warrant, a search warrant, or the existence of exigent

circumstances prompts their entry.” ) (emphasis added).          Second,


                                     16
     Case 1:05-cr-10129-DPW Document 26 Filed 05/18/06 Page 17 of 19



they must be able to articulate facts that support their belief

that the home “harbors an individual posing a danger” to the

officers on the scene.      Maryland v. Buie, 494 U.S. 325, 334

(U.S. 1990)   (“[T]here must be articulable facts which, taken

together with the rational inferences from those facts, would

warrant a reasonably prudent officer in believing that the area

to be swept harbors an individual posing a danger to those on the

arres t scene.”).

     In the present case, though the police entry into the apart

ment was justified by Rosa’s consent, the police have been unable

to articulate the kind of facts required by Buie to allow them to

sweep the apartment.    Sergeant Donovan testified that he had no

information that anyone other than Battle was inside the

apartment.    He stated, “I had a pretty good belief at that time

that there was a firearm located in that apartment.         I wanted to

determine that there were no other persons in the apartment that

may have access to that firearm . . . I did not have any other

information about anyone else in that apartment . . . .”          (Suppr.

Hr’g Tr. 46, 19-23; 47, 1-2, Feb. 9, 2006).

     This testimony clearly runs afoul of the Buie rule.          As

another district court has observed, “[T]he officers' lack of

information or possession of no information concerning such a

possibility cannot supply the articulable basis needed for the

sweep in the first instance.”     United States v. Fitzgerald, No.


                                   17
     Case 1:05-cr-10129-DPW Document 26 Filed 05/18/06 Page 18 of 19



04-320, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10826 (D. Pa. Mar. 15, 2006);

(quoting United States v. Colbert, 76 F.3d 773, 778 (6th Cir.

1996) (“‘No information’ cannot be an articulable basis for a

sweep that requires information to justify it in the first

place.")).

     In addition to failing to satisfy the Buie test, the police

in this case have improperly combined the separate requirements

of constitutional entry and articulable facts.        Indeed, Sergeant

Donovan referred to the need to conduct a protective sweep as the

reason for the initial, warrantless entry into Fonseca’s

apartment.   (Suppr. Hr’g Tr. 46, 13-18, Feb. 9, 2006) (“[W]e

proceeded into the apartment, we conducted a protective sweep of

the apartment to determine if there were any other individuals in

the apartment.”).

     It is true that, in some cases, the articulable facts that

give rise to the belief that a dangerous person is hiding within

a residence might also constitute the exigent circumstances that

would require entry by the police.      The same set of facts would

justify both a warrantless entry and a protective sweep and

satisfy the two protective sweep requirements.        In the case at

bar, however, there were neither articulable facts nor exigent

circumstances, and Sergeant Donovan’s reliance on the protective

sweep doctrine to justify his crossing of the threshold, as well

as his “sweep” of the apartment, is misplaced.

IV.   CONCLUSION

      Though the government relies improperly on the protective

sweep exception, its arguments concerning Battle’s standing,

Rosa’s consent, and the plain view doctrine succeed.

Accordingly, this Court DENIES the defendant’s motion to suppress

[docket entry #17].
