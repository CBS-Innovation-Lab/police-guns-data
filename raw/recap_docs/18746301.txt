                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE




United States of America

     v.                                         05-cr-45-PB

Zbigniew May



                                  O R D E R


     The defendant has moved to continue the September 7, 2005

trial in the above case.        Defendant cites the need for additional

time to engage in further plea negotiations.           The government does

not object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, in order to allow the parties additional time

to negotiate a plea agreement or prepare for trial, the court

will continue the trial from September 7, 2005 to December 6,

2005.     In agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds

pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated

reasons, the ends of justice served in granting a continuance

outweigh the best interests of the public and the defendant in a

speedy trial.
