     Defendant Craig Faulkner has moved through counsel to

continue the July 10, 2012 trial in the above case, citing the

need for additional time to complete discovery and prepare for

trial.     The government and co-defendants Wendy Ford, Craig Ford,

and Sharon Cote do not object to a continuance of the trial

parties additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court

will continue the trial from August 21, 2012 to November 6,

2012.     In agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds

pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ' 3161(h)(7)(A) that for the above-stated

reasons, the ends of justice served in granting a continuance

outweigh the best interests of the public and the defendants in
