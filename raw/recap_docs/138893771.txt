       ORDER AFFIRMING THE RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE
                      MAGISTRATE JUDGE

        On April 22, 2020, Joseph Scott Reeves filed a motion to vacate, set aside, or

correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Place-Holder 2255 Mot. (ECF No.

86) (Def.’s Mot.). 1 Mr. Reeves referred to his motion as a place holder because he has

a pending request before the First Circuit Court of Appeals for leave to file a second

or successive § 2255 motion. Id., Attach. 1. The United States Magistrate Judge filed

with the Court on May 21, 2020, his Recommended Decision on the motion, in which

he recommended that the Court transfer the pending § 2255 motion to the First

Circuit and deny a certificate of appealability pursuant to Rule 11 of the Rules

Governing Section 2255 Cases. Recommended Decision on 28 U.S.C. § 2255 Mot. at

1-4 (ECF No. 87) (Recommended Decision). Mr. Reeves did not file an objection.

        The Court reviewed and considered the Magistrate Judge’s Recommended


1       Though the docket reflects that this motion was not docketed until April 29, 2020, the prison
mailbox rule controls the date of filing of incarcerated individuals’ filings under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. See
Morales-Rivera v. United States, 184 F.3d 109, 109-10 (1st Cir. 1999) (holding that the prison mailbox
rule applies to motions under 28 U.S.C. § 2255). Mr. Reeves’ motion includes a declaration that he
placed his motion in the mail on April 22, 2020, see Def.’s Mot. at 12, and the Court adopts that date
as the date of filing.

Decision, together with the entire record, and made a de novo determination of all

matters adjudicated by the Magistrate Judge’s Recommended Decision. The Court

concurs with the Magistrate Judge’s recommendation to transfer the motion to the

First Circuit for the reasons set forth in his Recommended Decision.

      The Court declines to rule on Mr. Reeves’ anticipated request for a certificate

of appealability.   Under 28 U.S.C. § 2255(h), as this is Mr. Reeves’ second or

successive habeas corpus petition, the decision whether to certify his second or

successive motion by statute rests with the Court of Appeals, not this Court. As the

question of whether to issue a certificate of appealability touches directly upon the

question now pending before the First Circuit and because the First Circuit has the

authority to rule on the merits of that issue, the Court concludes that it is wiser in

deference to the First Circuit to dismiss the certificate of appealability question

without prejudice. See 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).

      1.     The Court AFFIRMS the Recommended Decision of the Magistrate
             Judge (ECF No. 87) with respect to the transfer of the pending § 2255
             motion.

      2.     The Court TRANSFERS the Joseph Scott Reeves’ Place-Holder 2255
             Motion (ECF No. 86) to the First Circuit Court of Appeals.

      3.     The Court DISMISSES without prejudice the question of whether a
             certificate of appealability should issue.

      SO ORDERED.
