                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 07-cr-94-PB

Joseph Downing



                                  O R D E R

     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

January 8, 2008 trial in the above case, citing the need for

additional time for defendant to undergo several surgeries

required as a result of injuries suffered while serving in Iraq.

The government does not object to a continuance of the trial

date.

     Accordingly, for the above reason and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from January 8, 2008 to May 6, 2008.              In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial
