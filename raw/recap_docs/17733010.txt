                            MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
     Defendant Benjamin Lewis (“Defendant”), appearing pro se,

moves by applications dated October 18, 2010 and April 19, 2012,

for a reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).

For the reasons set forth below, Defendant's motions are denied.

                                 BACKGROUND

     Defendant was charged with Felon in Possession of Ammunition

in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).        See Docket.    Defendant's

trial lasted from November 9, 1998 to November 16, 1998.           Id.   At

its conclusion, the jury found Defendant guilty of being a felon-

in-possession of ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. §

922(g)(1).   Id.

     The Pre-Sentence Report (“PSR”) applied a base offense level

of 24 under U.S.S.G. § 2k2.1(a)(2) based on the defendant having

“at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of

violence or a controlled substance offense.”        PSR, § 23, at 4.

The PSR then applied a 4 level increase in the base offense level

under U.S.S.G. § 2k2.1(b)(5) because the defendant used or

possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another
           Case 1:98-cr-10168-PBS Document 102 Filed 03/08/13 Page 2 of 8



felony offense.1 See PSR § 24, at 4.            Specifically, four levels

were added for Lewis’ use of a firearm “to fire three shots into

the exterior of Susan Vance’s residence.”             See PSR § 25, at 4.

       The PSR did not apply the cross reference to the aggravated

assault guideline, U.S.S.G. § 2A2.2 because it would have

resulted in a lower offense level than 2K2.1.              See PSR ¶ 32, at

4-5.

       After calculating an adjusted offense level of 28, see PSR §

29, at 4, the PSR applied the armed career criminal provisions in

U.S.S.G. § 4B1.4(b)(3)A) and calculated an offense level of 34

because the defendant was convicted of a violation of 18 U.S.C. §

922(g) and he had at least three prior convictions for a violent

felony and/or serious drug offenses.            PSR ¶¶ 33, 34 at 5.         This

determination adversely impacted the defendant’s offense level

and criminal history score.          The PSR lists the defendant’s

criminal history category as VI, based on 17 criminal history

points.       See PSR ¶ 45, at 11. Based upon an offense level of 34

and a criminal history category of VI, the guideline imprisonment

range was 262 to 327 months.           See PSR ¶ 92, at 22.     The Court

departed downward pursuant to U.S.S.G. ¶ 5K2.10 (a mitigating



       1
      Application Note 4 to U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1 states that a felony
offense “as used in subsection (b)(5), means any offense
(federal, state, or local) punishable by imprisonment for a term
exceeding one year, whether or not a criminal charge was brought,
or conviction obtained.” (emphasis added).

circumstance) and imposed a sentence of 216 months.             See Docket

No. 73, Sentencing Memorandum.

     Defendant’s conviction and sentence were affirmed by the

United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.             See Lewis

v. United States, No. 99-1298 (1st Cir. Nov. 6, 2000).             In

affirming the conviction and sentence, the appeals court

recognized that Susan Vance’s testimony was not critical because

“other witnesses had unequivocally identified the appellant as

the person who fired shots into the apartment house.”             Id.

     Defendant made an unsuccessful challenge to his conviction

pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 on other grounds. See Lewis v.

United States, C.A. No. 01-11949-PBS (denied by Order dated Mar.

26, 2002).

     In the Spring of 2010, Defendant, proceeding pro se, filed a

motion, styled:

     Title 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) Motion Concerning U.S.S.
     Guideline Amendment 599 Improper Enhancement. Movant also
     States Title 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) 1-7 Factors and U.S.S.
     Guideline § 1B1.11(a).”

See Def. Mot., Docket No. 95.         Because it was unclear whether the

Government had been served, the Clerk served the motion on the

Office of the United States Attorney.          See 9/29/10 Electronic

Order.

     The Government filed an Opposition on October 18, 2010.              See

Docket No. 98.      On April 19, 2012, Defendant filed a second

motion presenting the same arguments as presented in his 2010

                                       3
         Case 1:98-cr-10168-PBS Document 102 Filed 03/08/13 Page 4 of 8



motion and styled “Motion Under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) for

Modification of Sentence.”        See Docket No. 99.2

     The Court has reviewed the parties submissions and the

applicable law.      For the reasons that follow, Defendant’s motions

are DENIED.

                                  DISCUSSION

     As best can be gleaned from the pro se pleadings, Defendant

seeks to have this Court revisit the factors set forth in 18 §

3553(a) because he believes the four-level increase in the base

offense level was not warranted.           Defendant’s 2010 Motion

references U.S.S.G. § 1B1.11(a), which is the policy statement

directing the Court to use the Guidelines Manual in effect on the

date that the defendant is sentenced.3          See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.11(a).

     Section 3582(c)(2) allows the Court to reduce a defendant's

sentence if it was based on a sentencing range which was

subsequently lowered by an amendment to the United States

Sentencing Guidelines (“U.S.S.G.”) and if that reduction would be

consistent with the policy set forth in the U.S.S.G. See 18

U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).


     2
      Although the 2012 motion does not appear to have been
served on the Government, the Court will not delay disposition to
have this duplicative motion served.
     3
      An exception, not applicable here, arises where the
guideline in effect at sentencing would violation the ex post
facto clause of the United States Constitution, in which even the
court would use the guideline version in effect at the date of
the offense of conviction. See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.11(b)(1).

     1.      Amendment 599

     Defendant argues that Amendment 599 of the U.S.S.G., when

applied retroactively to his sentence, requires that he be re-

sentenced because he was given a four-level enhancement pursuant

to U.S.S.G. § 2k2.1(b)(5).        However, as noted by the Government,

Amendment 599 is not applicable to Lewis.           “Amendment 599’s

purpose, broadly stated, is to eliminate duplicative sentences

for essentially the same offense.”          United States v. Hickey, 280,

F.3d 65, 65 (1st Cir. 2002).         Amendment 599 “was enacted to

clarify under what circumstances a weapons enhancement may be

applied to an underlying offense when the defendant has also

received an 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) conviction, which provides

separate punishment for the use or possession of a firearm in a

violent crime.” United States v. Pringle, 350 F.3d 1172, 1176

(11th Cir. 2003) (emphasis added).

     Here, Defendant was convicted of possession of ammunition

after former conviction of a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §

922(g)(1), not possession or use of a firearm during and in

relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §

924(c)(1).     Defendant’s base level offense was determined

pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2k2.1(a)(2)4 and not U.S.S.G. § 2k2.4.



     4
      The base level offense was based on the defendant having
“at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of
violence or a controlled substance offense.” See U.S.S.G. §
2k2.1(a)(2).

                                       5
      Case 1:98-cr-10168-PBS Document 102 Filed 03/08/13 Page 6 of 8



Defendant’s sentence was not based on double counting for the

same conduct and Amendment 599 has no bearing on application of

Defendant’s guideline sentence.

     2.   Sufficiency of Evidence

     Defendant argues that the Court “erroneously imposed

[§2K2.1(b)(5)] enhancement based on insufficient evidence that

[he] intended to use the weapon in connection with a specifically

contemplated felony.”    See Pet. Mot., p. 2, Docket No. 95.           He

complains that the evidence was “insufficient to prove that [he]

had reason to know that he would use a gun to commit a felony,

much less to show actual intent or knowledge that a felony would

be committed.”   Id. at p. 3.

     The sentencing factors affecting a judge's discretion within

a statutorily prescribed range may be proved to a judge at

sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence.         United States v.

Leahy, 668 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 2012)(citing United States v.

O'Brien, 560 U.S. —, 130 S.Ct. 2169, 2174–75, 176 L.Ed.2d 979

(2010); Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct.

2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000)).

     In essence, Defendant challenges the four level enhancement

for possession of the ammunition “in connection with another

felony offense.”   See PSR, ¶ 25, at 4.      Four levels were added to

the base level offense because, in addition to his unlawful

possession of ammunition, Lewis used a firearm "to fire three


                                    6
       Case 1:98-cr-10168-PBS Document 102 Filed 03/08/13 Page 7 of 8



shots into the exterior of Susan Vance's residence."           See PSR §

25, at 4.

      The Government responds and states that Lewis was charged in

state court with possession of a firearm, possession of

ammunition and assault with a dangerous weapon; and that the

possession of a firearm and the assault with a dangerous weapon

are felonies under Massachusetts law.        See Gov’t Opp., Docket No.

98.   The Government argues that the enhancement was correctly

applied and also notes: “[a]t this date, some twelve years after

the pre-sentence report was completed, that contention was waived

and cannot be addressed at this time pursuant to a motion under

18 U.S.C. § 3585(c)(2).      Id. at n. 2.

      The Court agrees with the Government that Amendment 599 is

not applicable and Defendant cannot make this challenge pursuant

to Section 3585(c)(2).     The Court does note, however, that in

affirming Defendant’s sentence, the First Circuit recognized that

“witnesses had unequivocally identified the appellant as the

person who fired shots in the apartment house.”          Lewis v. United

States, No. 99-1298 (1st Cir. Nov. 6, 2000).

      Finally, as noted by the Government, even if these four

points were incorrectly assessed, Defendant reached an offense

level of 34 because of the armed career criminal calculation.

                                  ORDER

      Based upon the foregoing, it is hereby ORDERED that
