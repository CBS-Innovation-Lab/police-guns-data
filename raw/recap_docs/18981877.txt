                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 11-cr-41-PB

Claudio Silva



                                  O R D E R


     The defendant has moved to continue the August 16, 2011

trial in the above case, citing the need for additional time to

confer with counsel regarding new issues for consideration prior

to entering a plea or proceeding to trial. The government does

not object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, in order to allow the parties additional time

to properly prepare for trial, the court will continue the trial

from August 16, 2011 to October 4, 2011. In agreeing to continue

the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ' 3161(h)(7)

(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the ends of justice

served in granting a continuance outweigh the best interests of

the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
