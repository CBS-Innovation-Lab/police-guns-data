                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 08-cr-165-PB

Jason Rowan



                                  O R D E R

     Defendant, Jason Rowan, through counsel, has moved to

continue the trial scheduled for April 7, 2009, citing newly

appointed counsel and the need for additional time to complete

discovery or engage in plea negotiations.           The government does

not object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reasons and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from April 7, 2009 to June 2, 2009.             In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
