            RECOMMENDED DECISION ON 28 U.S.C. § 2255 MOTION

       In this action, Petitioner Joseph Scott Reeves moves, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255,

to vacate, set aside or correct his sentence.        (Amended Motion, ECF No. 55.)

In 2006, following a guilty plea, Petitioner was convicted of possession of firearms as a

felon, Hobbs Act robbery, and use of firearms during the commission of a federal crime of

violence; he was sentenced to a total prison term of 262 months. (Judgment, ECF No. 29

at 1-2.) Petitioner did not appeal from the conviction or the sentence.

       Petitioner asserts a claim pursuant to Johnson v. United States, --- U.S. ---,

135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015). (Amended Motion at 1.)         Following a review of Petitioner’s

motion, the Government’s request for dismissal, and the record, I recommend the Court

grant the Government’s request to dismiss Petitioner’s section 2255 motion.

               I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

       Petitioner was convicted of possession of firearms as a felon, 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1)

(Count 1); Hobbs Act robbery, 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a) (Count 2); and use of firearms during
the commission of a federal crime of violence, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (Count 3).

(Judgment at 1.)

      The Court concluded Petitioner was a career offender under the sentencing

guidelines, USSG § 4B1.1(a). (Presentence Order, ECF No. 26 at 1-2 n.2, and at 7;

Sentencing Tr., ECF No. 52 at 8.) The Court sentenced Petitioner to prison terms of

120 months on Count 1; 178 months on Count 2, to run concurrently; and 84 months

on Count 3, to run consecutively to Count 2, for a total prison sentence of 262 months.

(Judgment at 2.) The prison terms were to be followed by supervised release terms of three

years on Counts 1 and 2, and five years on Count 3, with all supervised release terms to

run concurrently. (Judgment at 3.)

      Petitioner states he placed his pro se motion in the prison mailing system on

January 25, 2016. (Motion, ECF No. 43 at 7.) Petitioner included in the pro se motion a

claim under Johnson. (Memorandum in Support, ECF No. 43-1 at 1.) Counsel was

appointed to represent Petitioner with respect to the Johnson claim. (Order, ECF No. 46.)

Petitioner, represented by counsel, filed an amended motion. (Amended Motion at 1.)

In the amended motion, Petitioner withdrew all claims except the Johnson claim. (Id. at 3.)

                                     II. DISCUSSION

      In Johnson, the statute at issue was the Armed Career Criminal Act,

18 U.S.C. § 924(e) (ACCA), which imposes a 15-year mandatory minimum prison term

when a defendant is convicted of a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) and has three previous

convictions, committed on separate occasions, “for a violent felony or a serious drug



                                            2
offense, or both.” 135 S. Ct. at 2555-57. Section 924(e)(2)(B) defines the term “violent

felony” and provides:

        [T]he term “violent felony” means any crime punishable by imprisonment
        for a term exceeding one year, . . . that—

        (i)    has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical
        force against the person of another; or

        (ii)    is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or
        otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical
        injury to another.

Section 924(e)(2)(B)(i) is known as the “force” clause or the “elements” clause;

the provision of section 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) that references burglary, arson, extortion, and the

use of explosives is known as the “enumerated offenses” clause; the remainder of section

924(e)(2)(B)(ii), i.e., the provision “or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious

potential risk of physical injury to another,” is known as the “residual” clause.

United States v. Starks, 861 F.3d 306, 314 (1st Cir. 2017); United States v. Edwards,

857 F.3d 420, 422-23 & n.2 (1st Cir. 2017).

        In Johnson, the Court held the residual clause unconstitutionally vague.

135 S. Ct. at 2555-57. The Court left intact the force clause and the enumerated offenses

clause of section 924(e)(2)(B): “Today’s decision does not call into question application

of the Act to the four enumerated offenses, or the remainder of the Act’s definition of a

violent felony.” 135 S. Ct. at 2563.1




1
 In Welch v. United States, --- U.S. ---, 136 S. Ct. 1257, 1268 (2016), the Supreme Court held that “Johnson
announced a substantive rule that has retroactive effect in cases on collateral review.”


                                                     3
        In Beckles v. United States, --- U.S. ---, 137 S.Ct. 886 (2017), the Supreme Court

held that Johnson does not apply to the “identically-worded” residual-clause portion of the

definition of “crime of violence” in the advisory sentencing guidelines, i.e., the guidelines

as applied after United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 233 (2005) (concluding the

guidelines must be considered advisory rather than mandatory).2 137 S. Ct. at 890, 894-95.

Petitioner’s Johnson claim based on his challenge to the residual clause of the sentencing

guidelines thus fails.

        The remaining issue is whether a Hobbs Act robbery qualifies as a “crime of

violence” under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) and thus was properly considered as a crime of violence

under USSG §§ 4B1.1(a)(2), 4B1.2(a). USSG § 4B1.1(a) provides in relevant part:

        A defendant is a career offender if (1) the defendant was at least eighteen
        years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of
        conviction; (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a
        crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and (3) the defendant
        has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a
        controlled substance offense.

When Petitioner was sentenced in 2006, USSG § 4B1.2(a) defined “crime of violence” as

follows:

        The term “crime of violence” means any offense under federal or state law,
        punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that –

        (1)    has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical
        force against the person of another, or



2
  In his reply memorandum, Petitioner acknowledged that following the Supreme Court’s decision in
Beckles, he had no viable claim regarding the career offender finding, i.e., the finding concerning the two
prior felony convictions that qualified as career offender predicates pursuant to
USSG §§ 4B1.1(a)(3), 4B1.2(a). (Reply, ECF No. 70 at 3; Presentence Order, ECF No. 26 at 1-3, 7;
Sentencing Tr., ECF No. 52 at 8.)

                                                    4
        (2)     is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of
        explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential
        risk of physical injury to another.

USSG § 4B1.2(a).3

        Section 924(c)      imposes      mandatory       minimum        firearms-related      sentence

enhancements when a defendant’s federal offense of conviction is a “crime of violence” or

a “drug trafficking crime.” Section 924(c)(3) defines “crime of violence” and provides:

        For purposes of this subsection, the term “crime of violence” means an
        offense that is a felony and –

        (A) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical
        force against the person or property of another, or

        (B) that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against
        the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing
        the offense.

        The appellant in United States v. García-Ortiz, No. 16-1405, --- F.3d ---,

2018 WL 4403947, 2018 U.S. App. Lexis 26267 (1st Cir. Sept. 17, 2018) argued, based

on Johnson and Sessions v. Dimaya, --- U.S. ---, 138 S. Ct. 1204 (2018),4 that the residual

clause language in 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) was unconstitutionally vague.                     García-Ortiz,

2018 WL 4403947, at *1-2, 2018 U.S. App. Lexis 26267, at *1-4.                      The First Circuit

concluded “any possible infirmity of section 924(c)’s residual clause” did not exculpate


3
 The residual clause has since been deleted from USSG § 4B1.2. USSG Supp. to App. C, amend. 798
(Aug. 1, 2016).     The amendment, however, does not apply retroactively.            USSG § 1B1.10;
United States v. Strevig, 663 F. App’x 908, 912 (11th Cir. 2016) (per curiam) (“The Sentencing
Commission . . . has not made Amendment 798 retroactive to individuals sentenced prior to the effective
date of the amendment.”).
4
 In Sessions v. Dimaya, --- U.S. ---, 138 S. Ct. 1204 (2018), the Supreme Court held that 18 U.S.C. § 16,
which contains a residual clause similar to the 18 U.S.C. § 924(e) residual clause at issue in Johnson,
“suffers from the same constitutional defect.” 138 S. Ct. at 1210-11.

                                                   5
García, because his Hobbs Act robbery was a crime of violence under section the force

clause of 924(c). 2018 WL 4403947, at *2, 2018 U.S. App. Lexis 26267, at *6. The Court

wrote:

         Having rejected García’s arguments, we therefore hold that because the
         offense of Hobbs Act robbery has as an element the use or threatened use of
         physical force capable of causing injury to a person or property, a conviction
         for Hobbs Act robbery categorically constitutes a “crime of violence” under
         section 924(c)’s force clause.

García-Ortiz, 2018 WL 4403947, at *5, 2018 U.S. App. Lexis 26267, at *13. Similarly,

here, based on García-Ortiz, Petitioner’s Hobbs Act robbery is considered a crime of

violence under section 924(c)(3)(A). See id. Petitioner’s contention that a Hobbs Act

robbery does not qualify as a crime of violence, therefore, fails.5

                                         III. CONCLUSION

         Based on the foregoing analysis, an evidentiary hearing is not warranted under

Rule 8 of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Cases.                   I recommend the Court deny

Petitioner’s motion for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. I further recommend that the

Court deny a certificate of appealability pursuant to Rule 11 of the Rules Governing

Section 2255 Cases because there is no substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional

right within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).
