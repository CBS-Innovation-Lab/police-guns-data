STATEMENT OF REASONS

VII COURT DETERMINATIONS OF RESTITUTION

A [:] Restitution Not Applicable.

B TOtal Amount of Restitution: 2’335 '68

C Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

l l:] For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

2 l:] For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
issues offact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing proceS under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(B).
3 l:] For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh

the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(1)(B)(ii).

4 l:] Restitution is not ordered for other reasons. (Explain.)

D l:] Paitial restitution is ordered for these reasons (18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)):
