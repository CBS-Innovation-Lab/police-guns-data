                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                          Case No. 08-cr-96-PB

Anthony Sawyer


                                   O R D E R


     The defendant has moved, through counsel, to continue the

trial scheduled for January 5, 2010.           I have granted six motions

to continue in this case.        Counsel's request for yet another

continuance is based on a claim that he has other cases in other

jurisdictions that give rise to a scheduling conflict.             His

motion assumes that the other cases must be tried first, but he

did not mention these cases when he sought his last continuance,

and he does not allege either that the cases that give rise to

the alleged conflict are older than this case or that they have

been continued more times than this case.           In short, he has

failed to demonstrate that the government's interest in obtaining

a speedy trial in this case should give way to the interests of

other sovereigns and other defendants in having their cases

resolved expeditiously.

      The motion to continue (Doc. No. 32) is denied.
