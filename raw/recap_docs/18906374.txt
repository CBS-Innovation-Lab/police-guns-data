                          UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                       FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

        v.                                         Case No. 09-cr-76-PB

Brian Fantry


                                      O R D E R

        The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

trial scheduled for June 2, 2009, citing the need for additional

time to engage in further plea negotiations or prepare for trial.

The government does not object to a continuance of the trial

date.

        Accordingly, for the above reasons and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from June 2, 2009 to August 18, 2009.                    In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. § 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
