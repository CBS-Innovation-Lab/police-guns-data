ORDER ON MOTION FOR SENTENCE REDUCTION UNDER 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A)
                   (COMPASSIONATE RELEASE)

       Before the Court is Defendant’s Motion for Compassionate Release (ECF No. 61). Having

reviewed this Motion, along with the Government’s Response (ECF No. 64), the Court DENIES

Defendant’s Motion.

       In the context of a motion for compassionate release, Defendant states complaints about

the conditions of his imprisonment and about the Bureau of Prison’s (“BOP”) calculation of good-

time credits.   Additionally, he requests that the Court order him to be remitted to home

confinement, or else transferred to a residential reentry management facility.

       For the reasons given in its October 5, 2021 Order, the Court denies Defendant’s renewed

request for compassionate release. (See 10/05/2021 Order (ECF No. 60), PageID #s 287–89.)

Furthermore, the Court reiterates that the conditions of Defendant’s confinement are not properly

brought before it for review. (See id., PageID # 288 n. 2.) Nor does the Court have the authority

to review, via the present Motion, Defendant’s challenge to the BOP’s calculation of his good-

time credits. See generally Barber v. Thomas, 560 U.S. 474 (2010) (evaluating an inmate’s

challenge to BOP’s calculation of good-time credits via a habeas petition) & Perez-Olivo v.

Chavez, 394 F.3d 45 (1st Cir. 2005) (same). The Court likewise cannot review BOP’s decision

not to place Defendant in home confinement in this posture. See Tapia v. United States, 564 U.S.

319, 330–31 (2011) (“When a court sentences a federal offender, the BOP has plenary control,

subject      to     statutory     constraints,      over      ‘the      place     of      the     prisoner’s

imprisonment’ . . . [D]ecisionmaking authority rests with the BOP.”). Finally, the Court takes

judicial notice of the fact that Defendant appears to have been transferred to a residential reentry

management facility, mooting his request on this point. 1

          For the foregoing reasons, Defendant’s Motion for Compassionate Release (ECF No. 61)

is hereby DENIED.

          SO ORDERED.

                                                           /s/ George Z. Singal
                                                           United States District Judge

Dated this 12th day of April, 2022.
