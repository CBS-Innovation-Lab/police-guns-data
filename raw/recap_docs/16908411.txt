               MEMORANDUM AND ORDER REGARDING
     PETITIONER’S MOTION TO VACATE, SET ASIDE OR CORRECT
            SENTENCE PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C. § 2255
                       (Docket No. 1)

                           September 21, 2005
PONSOR, D.J.

    The petitioner has filed this second motion pursuant to 28

U.S.C. § 2255, seeking to vacate, set aside or correct his

sentence.    A previous motion based on this statute was denied

by the court on March 2, 2001. This petition attempts to raise
issues pursuant to the Supreme Court’s decision in United

States v. Booker, 125 S.Ct. 738 (2005).

    This petition must be dismissed for two reasons.                    First,
this is a second petition barred by the Antiterrorism and

Effective Death Penalty Act (“AEDPA”) without appropriate
authorization.      See 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(3)(A).               Second, the
Supreme Court’s Booker decision has been held to have no
retroactive effect.        United States v. Cirilo-Munoz, 404 F.3d

527 (1st Cir. 2005). The petitioner may not invoke the Supreme
Court’s Booker decision as a basis for remedy.

is hereby ordered DISMISSED.           This case may now be closed.
    It is So Ordered.
