                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE




United States of America

     v.                                       Criminal No.   05-cr-206-01-B

Danny Rivera



                                  O R D E R


     The defendant has moved to continue the February 7, 2006

trial in the above case.        Defendant cites the need for additional

time to review discovery materials recently received.             The

government does not object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, in order to allow the parties additional time to

review discovery materials and properly prepare for trial, the

court will continue the trial from February 7, 2006 to June 6,

2006.     In agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds

pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated

reasons, the ends of justice served in granting a continuance

outweigh the best interests of the public and the defendant in a

speedy trial.
