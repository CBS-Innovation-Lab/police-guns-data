            KURBY DUMORNAY’S SENTENCING MEMORANDUM


   I. Introduction

      Mr. Dumornay respectfully submits this memorandum in order to provide

   information to assist the Court in fashioning a sentence “sufficient, but not greater

   than necessary” to achieve the statutory purposes of punishment, as required by 18

   U.S.C. § 3553(a) in light of United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005); United

   States v. Jimenez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 2006 WL 562154 18-19(1st Cir. Mar. 9,

   2006)(en banc)(Torruela, concurring)(“Finally, I think it is of critical importance that

   the majority opinion be understood to reinforce our commitment to the statutory

   requirement that, in all cases, district courts must impose sentences that are

   "sufficient, but not greater than necessary" to effectuate the goals of criminal

   punishment, as articulated in 18 U.S.C. §3553(a). In articulating its reasons for

   imposing any sentence, the district court must make clear reference to this central

   principle.”)

       Booker restored the district courts’ historic function and ability to fashion a

sentence tailored to the individual circumstances of the case and defendant before it by

requiring courts to consider factors other than the sentencing range prescribed by the

United States Sentencing Guidelines. United States v. Pho, 443 F.3d 53, 61-62 (1st Cir.

2006) (18 U.S.C. §3353(a) factors to be considered include "the nature and circumstances

of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant," "the need for the

sentence imposed," and "the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among

defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct,".) In fact,

under Section 3553(a), courts are required to sentence below the guideline range if such a

sentence would be sufficient to achieve the statutorily proscribed purposes of

punishment.

       Mr. Dumornay has been incarcerated for the last 11 months at the Plymouth

County House of Correction. He moves the Court impose a sentence of 16 months

incarceration, with a two year period of supervised release, a one hundred dollar special

assessment and no fine. Such a sentence is justified by the facts of this case, and is

“sufficient but not greater than necessary” to achieve the four purposes of sentencing set

forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) (2), United States v. Booker, 125 S.Ct. 738 ( 2005). Under

the circumstances of this case, which include Mr. Dumornay’s personal history and

characteristics, and the nature and circumstances of the offense, the proposed sentence is

just, reasonable, sufficient and not greater than necessary.

II. Argument

       Following the Supreme Court’s decision in United States v. Booker, 125 S.Ct.

738 (2005) a court must look to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), and impose a sentence that is




                                              2
  Case 1:04-cr-10309-GAO           Document 41        Filed 09/21/2007       Page 3 of 6



"sufficient but not greater than necessary" to achieve the four purposes of sentencing set

forth in § 3553(a)(2). Booker 125 S.Ct. at 764-65. In imposing sentence, the Court must

consider all of the factors set forth in § 3553(a)(1)-(7), United States v. Smith, 445 F.3d

1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 2006)

              1. Mr. Dumornay’s personal history and characteristics, and the nature
and circumstances of the offense. (§ 3553(a)(1))

a) Mr. Dumornay’s personal history and characteristics

        Kurby Dumornay is twenty-four years old, born in Boston and raised in Brockton,

Massachusetts (Presentence Report at Paragraphs 46-47; hereinafter citations to the

Presentence Report will be referred to as “PSR at ¶__”) . He appears to have had

somewhat difficult teenage years, evidenced by an estrangement with his mother (PSR at

¶48), his regular use of marihuana (PSR at ¶64) and two arrests at the age of 18 (PSR at

¶¶31-32). The second arrest resulted in incarceration and his forced departure from the

eleventh grade. (PSR at ¶67)

        Despite this setback, Mr. Dumornay persevered with his education and obtained

his GED, and subsequently attended Massasoit Community College for one year. (PSR at

¶68(. He also has a substantial employment history; he began working with Reebok at

16, and has had jobs with Herb Chambers and Old Navy. (PSR at ¶¶75-76). He worked

for his father on and off for several years, and most recently worked for Victory Real

Estate in Randolph as a loan officer (PSR at ¶71). Letters from people he worked with

are attached hereto, and speak to his professional qualities and to his potential in the work

force in the future.

        Mr. Dumornay also enjoys strong family support. His sister has written a letter to

the Court, filed herewith, on behalf of the family, and she writes of the importance Kirby



                                             3
  Case 1:04-cr-10309-GAO            Document 41         Filed 09/21/2007       Page 4 of 6



is to the family and the love they have for him. His earlier difficulties with his mother

are past, and she awaits his return home “so he can move forward with his life”.( PSR at

¶56).

        b) The nature and circumstance of the offense

        In March of 2004, law enforcement acting on an informant’s tip that Mr.

Dumornay was seen in possession of a handgun, secured a search warrant for the home in

which Mr. Dumornay lived with his parents. When law enforcement arrived at the home

to execute the search warrant, they met with Mr. Dumornay, who was 20 years old at the

time. After the officers explained to him why they were there, he cooperated and showed

them where the gun was hidden in a drop ceiling panel, and later he told them how it

came to be in his possession (PSR at ¶¶ 10-11). According to discovery produced by the

government, the gun was loaded, but inoperable, missing, among other parts, a firing pin.


        2. The need for the sentence a)“to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to

promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense”, b) “to afford

adequate deterrence to criminal conduct”, c) “to protect the public from further crimes of

the defendant”, and d) “to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational

training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner”

(§ 3553(a)(2)(A-D))

        The illegal possession of a firearm is a serious offense, as are practically all

violations of federal criminal statutes. That said, it should be recognized that the firearm

at issue here was inoperable, and was secured in the ceiling of his parent’s house. The

guideline range was increased by two levels based on the firearm having been stolen

(PSR at ¶21), though there is no evidence that Mr. Dumornay participated in its theft as



                                               4
  Case 1:04-cr-10309-GAO           Document 41       Filed 09/21/2007       Page 5 of 6



the firearm was stolen from a pawn shop in Alabama ( PSR at ¶12) or that he knew that it

was stolen.

       The proposed sentence adequately reflects the seriousness of the present offense,

promotes respect for the law, and provides substantial deterrence, both to Mr. Dumornay,

should he ever contemplate re-offending and to others in the community who commit like

crimes. While Mr. Dumornay has been in trouble previously, engaging in property

crimes, there is no history of violence which would necessitate his continued

incarceration in order to protect the public.

       Mr. Dumornay has no specific need for the various educational, vocational or

rehabilitative services the Bureau of Prisons offers. Mr. Dumornay has come to the point

in his life where he is no longer a kid and needs to decide what kind of future he wants

for himself. As noted above, he has demonstrated the ability to accomplish goals, like

obtaining his G.E.D. He has shown the ability to not simply maintain employment but to

be successful and respected by his colleagues and employers. But he has also

demonstrated a certain immaturity in the past, and made bad decisions which if repeated

will ultimately lead to continued incarcerations.

       The term of supervised release which this Court will impose can provide exactly

the “carrot and stick” necessary to encourage and monitor Mr. Dumornay’s positive

pursuits, and to be a constant reminder that re-incarceration is an immediately available

sanction should any criminal behavior be repeated. The proposed term of incarceration

followed by a term of supervised release will provide Mr. Dumornay with the assistance

and incentive to successfully make something of himself, and to put the mistakes of his

youth behind him.

       3. The “kinds of sentences available”, the “kinds of sentence and sentencing
range” established under the Guidelines and “any pertinent policy statement”
(§ 3553(a)(3)-(5)).

       Mr. Dumornay’s advisory guideline range is 18 to 24 months. The proposed

sentence of 16 months is a minor variance from the range, and reflective of the fact that

the firearm was inoperable (taking the facts of this case somewhat modestly outside the

“heartland”, as the Sentencing Commission was in all likelihood contemplating

functioning firearms when establishing the guideline ranges), and that the guideline range

was increased from 15 to 21 months to 18 to 24 months as the weapon, unbeknownst to

Mr. Dumornay, was stolen.

   II. Conclusion

       As set forth above, the Guidelines are advisory, and were created to fulfill the

goals of §3553. The time Mr. Dumornay has spent in Plymouth has been trying and

sobering, and have constituted real and significant punishment for his crime, and several

additional months, as the proposed sentence of 16 months would entail, will emphasize to

him the need for him to put his priorities in order. But neither Mr. Dumornay nor the

public is served by warehousing him for much longer. He is an intelligent, articulate and

personable young man, and he should be making something of himself and his future, as

he is capable of doing, and that process should begin now.
