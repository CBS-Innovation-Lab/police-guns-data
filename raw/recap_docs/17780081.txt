                               MEMORANDUM AND ORDER

    WILLIAM E. SMITH, United States District Judge.

          Jose Antonio Lazala has filed a Motion to Vacate, Set

    Aside, or Correct Sentence by a Person in Federal Custody

    (the “Motion”) (ECF No. 231) pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.

    In   his   Motion,   Lazala    asserts   ineffective     assistance     of

    counsel.      For    the    reasons   stated    below,   the   Motion   is

    DENIED and DISMISSED.

    I.    Background

          After months of investigation in the summer of 2008,

    seven individuals, including Lazala, were arrested based on

    narcotics trafficking activities.              On February 11, 2009, a

    federal grand jury in the District of Rhode Island returned

    a twenty-three count Superceding Indictment, six counts of

    which pertained to Lazala.        (ECF No. 31.)

          On October 23, 2009, Lazala pleaded guilty, pursuant

    to a written plea agreement, to: conspiracy to distribute
Case 1:08-cr-00141-S-LDA Document 249 Filed 07/29/13 Page 2 of 12 PageID #: 4846



    and possess with the intent to distribute one kilogram or

    more of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and

    (b)(1)(A) (Count I); illegal re-entry in violation of 8

    U.S.C. §§ 1326(a) and (b)(2) (Count XXI); being a felon in

    possession       of   ammunition        in       violation      of    18        U.S.C.    §

    922(g)(1)       (Count    XXII);      and        being   an    illegal          alien    in

    possession       of      ammunition         in     violation         of     18     U.S.C.

    § 922(g)(5)      (Count     XXIII).              Throughout     all       proceedings,

    Lazala was represented by attorney Charles A. Tamuleviz.

           In exchange for Lazala’s guilty plea, the government

    agreed    to:    recommend       a    Guidelines         sentence,         recommend      a

    two-level reduction in the offense level for acceptance of

    responsibility,           move        for        an      additional             one-level

    adjustment,       and     dismiss       Counts        III      and        VII    of     the

    Superceding Indictment.               (See Plea Agreement ¶ 2, ECF No.

    78.)     The government also agreed not to file a sentencing

    enhancement      pursuant        to   21     U.S.C.      §    851    for    two       prior

    felony drug convictions, which may have led Lazala to face

    mandatory life imprisonment.                (Id.)

           At the change of plea hearing on October 23, 2009,

    Lazala admitted that the total quantity of heroin involved

    in the case exceeded one kilogram and that he re-entered

    the United States after having been previously deported.

    (See Change of Plea Hr’g Tr. 19-20, Oct. 23, 2009, ECF No.
Case 1:08-cr-00141-S-LDA Document 249 Filed 07/29/13 Page 3 of 12 PageID #: 4847



    109.)    In actuality, Lazala agreed to the facts that the

    government     presented,     with       the       only    objections    involving

    minor, non-substantive clarifications.                     (Id. at 21-24.)

          The      Probation      Office           subsequently           prepared      a

    Presentence       Investigation          Report       (“PSR”)        stating     that

    Lazala had prior felony drug convictions, in addition to

    emphasizing the mandatory minimum sentence that he faced.

    (PSR ¶¶ 49-50, 72.)         Lazala’s Guidelines range was 151-188

    months of incarceration.           (Id. at ¶ 72.)                 The calculation

    included a credit for acceptance of responsibility.                              (Id.

    at ¶ 21.)

          At the April 2, 2010 sentencing hearing, Lazala made

    no objections to the PSR with the exception of a two-level

    adjustment     for    possession     of        a    dangerous     weapon.        (See

    Sent. Hr’g Tr. 4-5, Apr. 2, 2010, ECF No. 119.)                          The Court

    granted Lazala’s objection and imposed a sentence of 138

    months imprisonment on Counts I and XXI, consistent with

    the mid-point of the advisory Guidelines range, and ten

    years on Counts XXII and XXIII to run concurrently with

    Counts I and XXI. (Id. 42-43.)

          Lazala      subsequently     timely          filed    the   instant      Motion

    pursuant     to      28   U.S.C.     §     2255,          alleging     ineffective

    assistance     of    counsel.      Lazala           argues    that    his   counsel

    failed to: (1) contest the quantity of heroin involved, (2)
Case 1:08-cr-00141-S-LDA Document 249 Filed 07/29/13 Page 4 of 12 PageID #: 4848



    contest the role adjustment in regards to the conspiracy

    charge, and (3) challenge his re-entry charge.                   (Def.’s

    Mem. of Law & Facts in Support of Mot. (“Def.’s Mem.”) 7,

    ECF No. 231-1.)

    II.   Discussion

          A.     Section 2255

          Generally, the grounds justifying relief under § 2255 1

    are limited.         A court may grant relief under § 2255 in

    instances where the court finds a lack of jurisdiction, a

    constitutional error, or a fundamental error of law.                 See

    United     States    v.   Addonizio,   442   U.S.   178,   185   (1979).

    “[A]n error of law does not provide a basis for collateral

    attack unless the claimed error constituted a fundamental

    defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage

    of justice.”        Id. at 185 (internal citation omitted).


          1
              Title 28 U.S.C. § 2255 provides in pertinent part:

          A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court
          established by Act of Congress claiming the right
          to be released upon the ground that the sentence
          was imposed in violation of the Constitution or
          laws of the United States, or that the court was
          without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or
          that the sentence was in excess of the maximum
          authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to
          collateral attack, may move the court which
          imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or
          correct the sentence.

    28 U.S.C. § 2255(a).

          B.     Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claim

          Lazala’s      claim         that     his       counsel       was     ineffective         is

    without    merit.            In    order       to        succeed    on    an       ineffective

    assistance    claim,          Lazala          must       demonstrate          (1)    that     his

    counsel's representation fell below an objective standard

    of   reasonableness,              and    (2)     that       there     is       a    reasonable

    probability      that,        but       for    his        attorney’s          unprofessional

    errors,    the     result          of    the        proceeding        would         have     been

    different.       Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 688-94

    (1984); see also Moreno-Espada v. United States, 666 F.3d

    60, 64 (1st Cir. 2012).                   To satisfy the first part of the

    two-prong test, the defendant must show that “counsel made

    errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the

    ‘counsel’ guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.”

    Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687.                     Second, Lazala must show that

    “counsel's       errors       were       so      serious        as       to    deprive        the

    defendant     of       a     fair       trial,       a      trial     whose         result     is

    reliable.”       Id.

          “A    court          must     indulge          a     strong     presumption            that

    counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable

    professional        assistance;               that        is,   the      defendant           must

    overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the

    challenged       action           ‘might        be        considered           sound       trial
Case 1:08-cr-00141-S-LDA Document 249 Filed 07/29/13 Page 6 of 12 PageID #: 4850



    strategy.’” 2     Id. (quoting Michel v. Louisiana, 350 U.S. 91,

    101 (1955)).         Additionally, “[a]n error by counsel, even if

    professionally unreasonable, does not warrant setting aside

    the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no

    effect on the judgment.” Id. at 691.                    (citing United States

    v. Morrison, 449 U.S. 361, 364–65 (1981)).

           Here,    in    the    guilty      plea    context,     Lazala    “has    to

    demonstrate      ‘a      reasonable        probability        that,     but    for

    counsel's      errors,      he   would    not    have    pleaded      guilty   and

    would have insisted on going to trial.’”                        Moreno-Espada,

    666 F.3d at 64 (quoting United States v. Colon-Torres, 382

    F.3d 76, 86 (1st Cir. 2004)).                   Lazala “maintains that his

    plea    agreement     was    unintelligent        because     defense    counsel

    misinformed him as to the full and accurate exposure of the

    charge(s) and waiver of his appeal rights.”                        (Def.’s Mem.

    5.)

           The government emphasizes that the plea agreement was

    highly favorable to Lazala, and that “counsel would have

    been ineffective for jeopardizing this agreement by raising

    the frivolous challenges Lazala now seeks.”                        (Gov’t Resp.

    6-7.)      Despite      this,     Lazala    filed       the   instant    Motion,


           2
            As   Lazala’s  statements   indicate,  he  is  not
    challenging his counsel’s strategic decisions. (See Def.’s
    Mem. of Law & Facts in Support of Mot. (“Def.’s Mem.”) 4,
    6, ECF No. 231-1.)
Case 1:08-cr-00141-S-LDA Document 249 Filed 07/29/13 Page 7 of 12 PageID #: 4851



    asserting       that     his    counsel    was     ineffective.              Further,

    Lazala       states     that    “defendant      counsel’s           [sic]    did       not

    contest the determination of relevant conduct as to the

    quantity of heroin, conspiracy, re-entry, at sentencing.”

    (Def’s Mem. 7.)

           First, Lazala argues that his attorney was deficient

    for    the     failure    to    contest     his     role       and    his    relevant

    conduct in relation to the quantity of heroin involved.

    However, at the change of plea hearing, Lazala admitted

    that   the     total     quantity    of    heroin       involved      in     the      case

    exceeded one kilogram.              (See Change of Plea Hr’g Tr. 19-

    20.)         Further,     Lazala    agreed        to     the    facts       that       the

    government presented in regards to the quantity of drugs

    involved.       (Id. at 15-23.)       As mentioned above, Lazala only

    contested minor, non-substantive facts presented.                             (Id. at

    21-24.)

           Second,     Lazala       contends    that       his     attorney      did       not

    contest the determination of the conspiracy.                          (Def.’s Mem.

    11.)      Lazala       asserts     that    he     was    not     a    part    of       the

    conspiracy,       and    that,     instead,       “[h]e       was    just    a     small

    dealer.”       (Id.)       However,       Lazala        did    not    contest          the

    government’s facts, including the facts that he sold 21.91

    grams of heroin directly to a customer and purchased the

    heroin    he    sold     from    another    individual          involved         in   the
Case 1:08-cr-00141-S-LDA Document 249 Filed 07/29/13 Page 8 of 12 PageID #: 4852



    conspiracy.       (See Change of Plea Hr’g Tr. 15-21; see also

    Plea    Agreement.)          Overall,    the    evidence    against     Lazala

    supported the conclusion that even though he was not an

    organizer or leader, he was a manager or supervisor of the

    conspiracy.       (PSR ¶ 26; see also Change of Plea Hr’g. Tr.)

           Third,     Lazala      also    claims    that   counsel   failed     to

    challenge       his    re-entry      charge.      Lazala   now   claims     his

    deportation was illegal; “[s]o there was never a Illegal

    Re-entry    [sic]       by    the    defendant.”       (Def.’s   Mot.      10.)

    Although confusing, Lazala contends that “[n]or the court

    or   neither     the    defendant      [sic]    counsel,    never     informed

    defendant about how these plea/convictions could affect his

    papers, and never did counsel or this court look at his

    deportable papers or his old conviction to see if defendant

    was ever informed about how plea could affect his papers in

    U.S.A.”         (Id.     (citing      Strickland).         However,    Lazala

    admitted to re-entering the United States after having been

    previously deported due to the commission of a crime.                      (See

    Sent. Hr’g Tr. 39.)            Lazala has also failed to offer any

    evidence that his deportation was illegal or that his re-

    entry     was    in    fact    legal.          Thus,   regardless     of    his

    contention that he was illegally deported, his claim that

    his counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge his

    conviction for illegal re-entry is without merit.
Case 1:08-cr-00141-S-LDA Document 249 Filed 07/29/13 Page 9 of 12 PageID #: 4853



           In       furtherance        of    Lazala’s       re-entry          argument,       he

    asserts “the Supreme Court, in Padilla v. Kentucky, 130

    S. Ct.      1473,        1480-82     (2010)      recognized         that     the       Sixth

    Amendment Right to effective assistance of counsel includes

    a    duty    to    inform        non-citizens        defendant’s       [sic]       of    the

    impact      a     plea    will     have     on    their      immigration        status.”

    (Def.’s         Mem.     10.)       In     Padilla,       the     Court      held       that

    constitutionally               competent    counsel       would     have     advised       a

    defendant that a conviction for drug distribution may make

    him subject to automatic deportation.                         Padilla, 130 S. Ct.

    at    1478.        The     Court    further       emphasized        that     prevailing

    professional           norms     supported       the   fact     that      counsel       must

    advise a client about the risk of deportation.                                     Id. at

    1482.       There, counsel provided the defendant with the false

    assurance         that    his     conviction         would    not    result        in    his

    removal from the country.                  Id. at 1483.

           Padilla is unhelpful to Lazala.                       Lazala pleaded guilty

    before Padilla, so it was not clearly established law at

    the    time       of     his    guilty     plea. 3       Further,         there     is    no

    indication         in    the     opinion     that      Padilla      was    to     be    made




           3
           Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S. Ct. 1473 (2010), was
    decided on March 31, 2010, three days before Lazala’s
    sentencing.
Case 1:08-cr-00141-S-LDA Document 249 Filed 07/29/13 Page 10 of 12 PageID #: 4854



    retroactively applicable. 4        Therefore, Lazala’s counsel did

    not violate the Strickland test as it is unreasonable to

    expect Lazala’s attorney to undo a plea agreement based on

    a case that was decided three days prior to his sentencing.

          Above all, Lazala has stated that he understood the

    terms of the plea agreement, that his decision to plead

    guilty was voluntary, and that he was fully satisfied with

    the   representation     he   received       by   his    attorney.          (See

    Change of Plea Hr’g Tr. 5-6.)               Although Lazala raises the

    above-mentioned arguments, he fails to explain that there

    was a reasonable probability that he would not have pleaded

    guilty but for counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness.                    Not only

    has Lazala failed to demonstrate that counsel made such

    serious errors, he has also failed to show that the alleged

    errors were so serious as to deprive him of a fair trial,

    or demonstrate the effect that such errors may have had on

    his   sentence.       Therefore,      his    contentions       are     without

    merit.

          Lazala    has   also    filed   a     reply   memorandum         to    the

    government’s response (ECF No. 246) in which Lazala raises

    new   arguments.       The    Court    declines         to   address    these

    arguments as including them violates the Rules Governing

    Section 2255 Proceedings. 5

            C.       Additional Requests

            At one point, Lazala filed a Motion to Stay.                           (ECF No.

    233.)        He also requested the appointment of legal counsel,

    in addition to an evidentiary hearing.                        (ECF No. 231.)

          Although           Lazala       filed      the        Motion    to    Stay,     he

    subsequently           filed      a   motion         for     leave    to    file     the

    aforementioned reply memorandum, which was granted by text

    order       on   March    20,     2013.        He    then     submitted     his    reply

    memorandum to the government’s response.                              Therefore, the

    Court denies the Motion to Stay as moot.

          The Court also denies the request for appointment of

    counsel,         and    finds     that    an    evidentiary          hearing    is   not

    necessary.

    III. Conclusion

          Given that Lazala has failed to submit evidence that

    his     counsel’s         representation             fell     below    an   objective

    standard         of    reasonableness          and    that,     but   for   counsel’s

            5
            Rule 2 of the Rules Governing Section 2255
    Proceedings makes clear that the motion to vacate, set
    aside, or correct the sentence must specify all the grounds
    for relief available to the moving party. Federal Criminal
    Code and Rules, Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings

    also id., Rule 5.     Lazala is therefore limited to the
    arguments raised in his Motion and the government’s
    response. Id., Rule 5.

    errors,     the    result         of    the     proceeding    would      have   been

    different,        he        has   not     met     the     Strickland      standard.

    Moreover,    he    has        failed    to    show   that    but   for    counsel’s

    errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have

    instead    insisted          on   going   to     trial.      For   the    foregoing

    reasons, the instant Motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 is

    hereby DENIED and DISMISSED.



                  RULING ON CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY

          Pursuant to Rule 11(a) of the Rules Governing Section

    2255 Proceedings in the United States District Courts, this

    Court hereby finds that this case is not appropriate for

    the   issuance         of    a    certificate      of   appealability       (“COA”)

    because Lazala has failed to make a substantial showing of

    the denial of a constitutional right as to any claim, as

    required by 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).

          Lazala is advised that any motion to reconsider this

    ruling will not extend the time to file a notice of appeal

    in this matter.              See Rule 11(a), Rules Governing Section

    2255 Proceedings.

    IT IS SO ORDERED:
