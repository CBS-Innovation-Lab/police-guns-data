                                  SPECIAL CONDITIONS OF SUPERVISION
In addition, the defendant shall comply with the following special conditions:

As directed by the probation officer, the defendant shall participate in a program approved by the United States Probation
Office for treatment of narcotic addiction or drug or alcohol dependency which will include testing for the detection of
substance use or abuse. The defendant shall also abstain from the use of alcoholic beverages and/or all other intoxicants
during and after the course of treatment. The defendant shall pay for the cost of treatment to the extent he is able as
determined by the probation officer.

The defendant shall participate in a program of mental health treatment, as directed by the probation officer, until such time as
the defendant is released from the program by the probation officer. The defendant shall pay for the cost of treatment to the
extent he is able as determined by the probation officer.

The defendant shall submit his person, residence, office, or vehicle to a search conducted by a U.S. Probation Officer at a
reasonable time and in a reasonable manner, based upon reasonable suspicion that contraband or evidence of a violation of a
condition of release may exist; failure to submit to a search may be grounds for revocation; the defendant shall warn any other
residents that the premises may be subject to searches pursuant to this condition.



Upon a finding of a violation of probation or supervised release, I understand that the court may: (1) revoke supervision; (2)
extend the term of supervision; and/or (3) modify the conditions of supervision.

These conditions have been read to me. I fully understand the conditions and have been provided a copy of them.
