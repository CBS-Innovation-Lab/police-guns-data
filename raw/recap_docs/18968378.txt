                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                        DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

             v.                           Criminal No. 10-cr-145-01-JD

Akim Alleyne


                                  O R D E R


        The assented to motion to reschedule jury trial (document no.

13) filed by defendant is granted; no further continuances.              Trial

is continued to the two-week period beginning April 19, 2011, 9:30

AM.

        Defendant shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights within 10

days.    The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting

a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv), for the

reasons set forth in the motion.

        SO ORDERED.



                                          /s/ Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr.
