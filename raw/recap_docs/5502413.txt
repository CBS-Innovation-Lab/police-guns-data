            ASSENTED-TO MOTION TO CONTINUE STATUS CONFERENCE

       Counsel for the defendant Ernest Edwards respectfully moves

this Court for a brief continuance of the upcoming status

conference in the above-captioned case.          The conference is

scheduled for July 16, 2008.        Counsel requests a one-week

continuance of the conference.          As grounds for this motion,

counsel states that one purpose of the conference was to report

to the court on counsel’s and the defendant’s review of the pre-

plea presentence report.       At the time the conference was

scheduled for July 16, the parties anticipated that the report

would be completed by the end of June and that counsel would have

been able to meet with the defendant in the intervening period

after receiving the report.        However, the report was not finished

until yesterday, July 14, and counel was not able to look at it

until today’s date because she was away from the office on July

14.

       In sum, counsel needs an extra week to review the report

herself and to discuss its import with the defendant, who has not

yet seen it.     Counsel is therefore asking for a brief continuance

of the status hearing.      Counsel has conferred with Assistant U.S.

Attorney William Connolly regarding this motion for a continuance

and represents that he has no objection to the granting of this

motion.

     Wherefore, for the above-stated reasons counsel for the

defendant respectfully requests that this motion to continue the

status conference in this case be granted.
