                        UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                     FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

      v.                                      Case No. 07-cr-52-01-PB

Bienvenido Jerez


                                      ORDER


      The presentence report and the underlying police reports

confirm the governmentâ€™s assertion that the convictions at issue

were separated by an intervening arrest.            Therefore, the

defendant is not entitled to the relief he seeks.             The motion for

resentencing (Doc. No. 21) is denied.

      SO ORDERED.
