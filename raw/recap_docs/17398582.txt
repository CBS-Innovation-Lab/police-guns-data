             AMENDED MEMORANDUM AND ORDER DENYING RELIEF
          UNDER 28 U.S.C. § 2255 AND 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2)

William E. Smith, United States District Judge.

      John Kimbrough has filed a motion to vacate, set aside, or

correct sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 and a motion for

reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).            For the

reasons stated below, both motions must be denied.

I.    BACKGROUND AND TRAVEL

      Kimbrough pled guilty to a two-count indictment charging him

with (1) possession with intent to distribute more than five grams

of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and

(b)(1)(B)(iii), and (2) possession of a firearm after having been

convicted of a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).

Throughout his plea and sentencing proceedings, Kimbrough was

represented by Federal Defender Edward C. Roy.

      The presentence report (PSR) calculated an advisory Sentencing

Guideline range of 188 to 235 months based on Kimbrough’s status as

a Career Offender, see U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, with a net offense level

of   31   (34    less    a   3-level    reduction     for   acceptance     of

responsibility) and a Criminal history category VI. (PSR ¶¶ 28, 29
Case 1:06-cr-00116-S-LDA Document 62 Filed 04/27/10 Page 2 of 11 PageID #: 224



46.)       Had Kimbrough not been deemed a Career Offender, his offense

level would have been 28.           (Id., ¶¶ 27, 28.)

       At     the    sentencing    hearing,      Kimbrough’s    counsel   made    no

objection       to   the    PSR   but   instead    argued    that   Kimbrough    had

cognitive and learning disabilities and requested a sentence of 120

months for his drug offense. (See Transcript of Sentencing Hearing

conducted on June 1, 2007 [“Sent. Tr.”] at 6-8.)                     After hearing

argument, this Court sentenced Kimbrough to 150 months imprisonment

-- 38 months below the applicable advisory guideline range – on the

crack cocaine offense and to 120 months imprisonment on the firearm

offense, to be served concurrently.                (Id. at 17-18.)      This Court

also imposed five-year and three-year terms of supervisory release

for these offenses.

       Kimbrough did not file a direct appeal, and his conviction

became final on June 21, 2007.                 Thereafter, he timely filed the

instant motion to vacate (Doc. #38), asserting (1) that his counsel

rendered ineffective assistance by failing to challenge the Court’s

treatment of his Career Offender status as mandatory; and (2) that

he should receive the benefit of the Guideline Amendments reducing

the    penalties      for   convictions     involving       crack   cocaine.     The

Government filed an objection to the motion (Doc. #45), and

Kimbrough submitted two additional filings in support of his motion

to vacate.1


       1
       See “Motion to Supplement the 28 U.S.C. § 2255"[sic] (Doc.
#46); Reply (Doc. # 48). The “Motion to Supplement” was granted by

                                           2
Case 1:06-cr-00116-S-LDA Document 62 Filed 04/27/10 Page 3 of 11 PageID #: 225



      Thereafter,    Attorney    Francis    Flanagan    was   appointed    to

represent Kimbrough. Although no further documents have been filed

in support of the motion to vacate, Attorney Flanagan, after

several continuances, filed on Kimbrough’s behalf a motion for

reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) along with

a memorandum in support (Doc. #58), which the Government has

likewise opposed.2

      Because the motion to vacate and the motion for reduction of

sentence are based on similar grounds, this Court will consider and

determine both motions in this Memorandum and Order.3

II.   Discussion

      A.    General Principles



this Court but is itself a supplemental memorandum in support of
Kimbrough’s § 2255 motion to vacate.
      2
       Kimbrough himself had previously filed two motions for
reduction of sentence pursuant to § 3582(c)(2) (Docs. ##34, 37),
both of which were denied by this Court. A third pro se motion for
reduction of sentence (Doc. ## 51-52), filed after counsel was
appointed to represent him, was not accepted for filing. See Order
returning document (Doc. #53).
      3
       Although Kimbrough has requested a hearing, no hearing is
required in connection with any issues raised by the instant motion
to vacate because, as discussed infra, the files and records of
this case conclusively establish that the claims in the motion to
vacate are without merit. See David v. United States, 134 F.3d
470, 477 (1st Cir. 1998) (district court properly may forego any
hearing “when (1) the motion is inadequate on its face, or (2) the
movant's allegations, even if true, do not entitle him to relief,
or (3) the movant's allegations need not be accepted as true
because they state conclusions instead of facts, contradict the
record, or are inherently incredible") (internal quotations
omitted). See also Panzardi-Alverez v. United States, 879 F.2d
975, 985 n.8 (1st Cir. 1978) (no hearing required where district
judge is thoroughly familiar with case).

      Title 28 U.S.C. § 2255 provides in pertinent part:

           A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court
      established by Act of Congress claiming the right to be
      released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in
      violation of the Constitution or laws of the United
      States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to
      impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess
      of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject
      to collateral attack, may move the court which imposed
      the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the
      sentence.

 28 U.S.C. § 2255(a).

      Generally, the grounds justifying relief under § 2255 are

limited.    A court may grant such relief only if it finds a lack of

jurisdiction, constitutional error or a fundamental error of law.

See United States v. Addonizio, 442 U.S. 178, 185 (1979) (“[A]n

error of law does not provide a basis for collateral attack unless

the claimed error constituted a fundamental defect which inherently

results     in    a   complete   miscarriage   of   justice.”)     (internal

quotations and citation omitted).

      B.    Ineffective Assistance Claim

      Kimbrough first claims that his counsel was ineffective by

failing to challenge the Court’s treatment of his Career Offender

status as mandatory at sentencing. Because it is based on a flawed

factual premise, this claim fails.

      A defendant who claims that he was deprived of his Sixth

Amendment        right   to   effective   assistance    of   counsel     must

demonstrate:

      (1)   That his counsel’s performance fell below an objective
            standard of reasonableness; and

                                      4
Case 1:06-cr-00116-S-LDA Document 62 Filed 04/27/10 Page 5 of 11 PageID #: 227



      (2)    [A] reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s
             unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would
             have been different.

Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 694 (1984).                    See

Cofske v. United States, 290 F.3d 437, 441 (1st Cir. 2002).

      In assessing the adequacy of counsel’s performance, the Court

looks to “prevailing professional norms.”              All that is required is

a   level   of    performance   that    falls   within    generally      accepted

boundaries of competence and provides reasonable assistance under

the circumstances. Ramirez v. United States, 17 F. Supp. 2d 63, 66

(D.R.I. 1998) (quoting Scarpa v. DuBois, 38 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.

1994) and citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688).

      Here,      while   Kimbrough     is   correct     that    the    Sentencing

Guidelines are now merely advisory in light of the Supreme Court’s

decision in United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), the

factual     basis   of   his   ineffective    assistance       claim   is   flatly

contradicted by the record.          The record shows that in sentencing

Kimbrough, this Court was well aware that the guidelines were

advisory.     Kimbrough’s sentence of 150 months was 38 months below

the   applicable     guideline    range.        This    Court    exercised     its

post-Booker discretion to impose that sentence, citing such factors

as Kimbrough’s cognitive and learning disabilities and alluding to

its review of the psychiatric report from Dr. Tremont.                 (See Sent.

Tr. at 11, 15-18.)        Moreover, this Court twice referred to “the

advisory guideline range” at the sentencing hearing.                   (See Sent.

Tr. at 3, 4.)        The fact that, as discussed infra, Kimbrough’s

                                        5
Case 1:06-cr-00116-S-LDA Document 62 Filed 04/27/10 Page 6 of 11 PageID #: 228



guideline range was based on his Career Offender status rather than

on his offense conduct does not affect this Court’s treatment of

the guidelines as advisory.

      In   short,    Kimbrough’s        counsel   did    not    render    deficient

performance in failing to object to the Court’s treatment of the

guidelines as mandatory, because this Court did not treat the

guidelines as mandatory.          Thus, Kimbrough’s ineffective assistance

claim must be rejected.

      C.    Crack-Cocaine Guideline Amendments

      Kimbrough next claims that this Court erred in failing to

retroactively       apply   the     Guideline     Amendments        pertaining    to

sentences    for    crack-cocaine        offenses,      see    U.S.S.G.    App.   C,

Amendments 706 and 713 (“crack cocaine Guideline Amendments ”), to

his sentence.4

      A threshold issue as to this claim is whether it is properly

brought pursuant to § 2255.             Although the First Circuit has not

directly addressed this issue, other courts have found that a §

2255 motion to vacate is not the proper procedural vehicle for

seeking    the   reduction    of    a    sentence    based     on   a   retroactive

Guideline amendment and that such relief should instead be sought

via a motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §

3582(c)(2).      See e.g. United States v. Porter, 335 Fed. Appx. 408,



      4
       Amendment 706, effective November 1, 2007, reduced the base
offense levels for crack offenses by two levels. Amendment 713,
effective March 3, 2008, made amendment 706 retroactive.

                                          6
Case 1:06-cr-00116-S-LDA Document 62 Filed 04/27/10 Page 7 of 11 PageID #: 229



409 (5th Cir. 2009) (upholding district court's re-characterization

of § 2255 motion as motion to reduce sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C.

§ 3582(c)(2)); United States v. Newman, C.A. No. 4:07-cv4581, 2009

WL 2413282 at *9 (S.D. Tex. July 29, 2009) (request to lower

offense level pursuant to Amendment 706 is not proper under § 2255,

but is a claim for a sentence modification pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §

3582(c)(2)).     The terms of both the Guidelines and § 3582(c)(2)

suggest this result as well.           See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10(a)(1); 18

U.S.C.    §   3582(c)(2).5     Thus,   this   claim    must   be   denied   as

improperly asserted in his § 2255 motion.

      Even if the claim were properly asserted in Kimbrough’s § 2255

motion, it is without merit in any event.             Kimbrough's guideline

range was based on the Career Offender guideline, U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1,

rather than on the crack cocaine guideline provision, U.S.S.G. §

2D1.1.    (See PSR at ¶28; Sent. Tr. at 3.), and thus “his sentence

was not ‘based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered’

by Amendment 706.”      United States v. Caraballo, 552 F.3d 6, 11-12

(1st Cir. 2008).




      5
        U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10(a)(1) provides in pertinent part that
where a defendant’s guideline range “has subsequently been lowered
as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in
subsection (c) below, the court may reduce the defendant’s term of
imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).” (Emphasis
added.)
     Section 3582(c)(2) provides that a court “may reduce the term
of imprisonment” of a “defendant who has been sentenced . . . based
on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by [a
Guideline Amendment].”

                                       7
Case 1:06-cr-00116-S-LDA Document 62 Filed 04/27/10 Page 8 of 11 PageID #: 230



      Accordingly, Kimbrough is not entitled to receive any relief

under the crack cocaine Guideline Amendments, and this claim

fails.6

      D.    Motion for Reduction of Sentence

      Kimbrough has, through his counsel, separately filed a motion

for reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2)

(“§ 3582 Motion ”). In this motion, Kimbrough asserts that had the

crack cocaine Guideline Amendments been in effect on the date of

his sentencing,7 his offense level and resulting guideline range

would have been lower, and that therefore this Court would have

imposed an even lesser sentence than the one given.              As part of

this claim, Kimbrough concedes that the offense level set forth in

the PSR was correct but contends that his sentence was based on the

crack cocaine guideline provision, U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1 -- which

provision was affected by the crack cocaine Guideline Amendments.

(See § 3582 Motion at 2-3.)

      The short answer to this contention is that Kimbrough’s

guideline range, as noted above, was based on the Career Offender

guideline, U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, rather than on the crack cocaine

guideline provision (PSR, ¶ 28; Sent. Tr. 3), and thus his sentence

was not “based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been


      6
       This Court notes that it has already rejected a similar
claim in its denial of Kimbrough’s pro se motions under 18 U.S.C.
§ 3582(c)(2).
      7
       Kimbrough was sentenced on June 1, 2007; the crack cocaine
Guideline Amendments became effective on November 1, 2007.

                                      8
Case 1:06-cr-00116-S-LDA Document 62 Filed 04/27/10 Page 9 of 11 PageID #: 231



lowered” by the recent crack cocaine amendments.            Caraballo, 552

F.3d at 9.     Accord United States v. Ayala-Pizarro, 551 F.3d 84, 85

(1st Cir. 2008); United States v. Ganun, 547 F.3d 46, 47 (1st Cir.

2008).      As the Court of Appeals explained in Caraballo, under

U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10 a sentencing court is not authorized to reduce a

defendant's sentence when a retroactive amendment does not result

in lowering the applicable sentencing range for the defendant.

Caraballo, 552 F.3d at 10.8         See U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10(a)(2)(B) (“A

reduction in the defendant's term of imprisonment is not consistent

with this policy statement and therefore is not authorized under 18

U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) if - an amendment . . . does not have the effect

of lowering the defendant's applicable guideline range.”).

      In view of this, Kimbrough's argument that this Court would

have been influenced by a lesser guideline range resulting from the

crack cocaine Guideline Amendments falls by the wayside, and relief

under § 3582(c)(2) is unavailable, as there is no lesser guideline

range applicable here.      See Caraballo, 552 F.3d at 11-12.




      8
          The Court of Appeals further noted:
          Had the new guideline provision for crack cocaine
          offenses (Amendment 706) been in effect when this
          defendant was sentenced, that provision would not have
          had any effect on the sentencing range actually used. As
          we have said, the defendant's actual sentencing range
          was produced by reference to section 4B1.1 (the career
          offender guideline), not section 2D1.1 (the crack
          cocaine guideline). Thus, Amendment 706 did not lower
          the defendant's actual sentencing range.
Caraballo, 552 F.3d at 11.

                                      9
Case 1:06-cr-00116-S-LDA Document 62 Filed 04/27/10 Page 10 of 11 PageID #: 232



      Moreover, this Court's consideration of the psychiatric report

and other factors set forth in the PSR in connection with its

imposition of a below-guidelines sentence does not change this

result.     Indeed, because this Court’s original variant below-

guideline sentence was already based in part on those factors --

which are independent of the considerations underlying the crack

cocaine Guideline Amendments -- this Court would not have been

inclined to impose an even lesser sentence had those amendments

been in effect, nor is it so inclined now.            Cf. United States v.

Russell, CR 03-094S, 2009 WL 4981460 at *4 (D.R.I. Dec. 22, 2009)

(“If the Court believed that the [crack-powder cocaine] disparity

warranted an even lower sentence, it would have granted one” at the

initial sentencing).

      Thus, Kimbrough's motion for reduction of sentence must be

denied.

III. Conclusion

      For all of the foregoing reasons, Kimbrough’s motion to vacate

sentence is DENIED and DISMISSED. Kimbrough’s motion for reduction

of sentence (Doc. #58) is likewise DENIED and DISMISSED.9




      9
       In view of the dispositions of these motions, KImbrough’s
letter request for new counsel (see letter dated November 7, 2009
from John Kimbrough to the undersigned, in Court file) is hereby
denied as moot. This Court notes that this request is based in
part on Kimbrough’s perception that his counsel had failed to
respond to this Court’s Show Cause Order, when in fact Attorney
Flanagan did file the § 3582(c)(2) motion for reduction of sentence
discussed herein.

RULING ON CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY

      Pursuant    to   Rule   11(a)    of   the   Rules    Governing    §   2255

Proceedings in the United States District Courts, this Court hereby

finds that this case is not appropriate for the issuance of a

certificate of appealability (COA) as to the denial of his § 2255

motion    to   vacate,   because      Kimbrough   has     failed   to   make   a

substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right as to

any claim, as required by 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).

      Kimbrough is advised that any motion to reconsider this ruling

will not extend the time to file a notice of appeal in this matter.

See § 2255 Rule 11(a).
