                GOVERNMENT’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION
                    TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE AND STATEMENTS1

         The United States of America, by and through its attorneys, United States Attorney

Michael J. Sullivan and Assistant United States Attorney Paul R. Moore, hereby respectfully

submits this Memorandum in opposition to defendant JEREL A. LESLIE's Motion to Suppress

Evidence and Statements.2

                                                    Summary

         The defendant argues that the officers did not have a reasonable suspicion of criminal

activity which would justify an investigatory stop of the vehicle because there was no traffic

violation and the defendant was not engaged in any other inappropriate or unlawful activity.

Because the stop was not justified, the defendant argues, any evidence obtained as a result of that

stop should be excluded.

         The government asserts that there was probable cause for stopping the automobile

         1
           See “Attachment 1" (ATF Special Agent O’Hara’s findings regarding the intersection and attached images
of the area).
         2
           In an effort to further illuminate previous state court findings on the issue, the Supreme Judicial Court’s
ruling on the Motion to Suppress is attached as “Attachment 2" (denying the Motion of state co-defendant Ralph
Toussaint, who was a passenger in the front seat of the same vehicle and was found to be carrying a separate firearm
on his person, although he was not federally-charged).

because the officers observed what they reasonably believed to be a traffic violation.3 In view of

the objective circumstances, it was reasonable for the officers to believe that such a violation had

occurred, and as a result, the stop was justified. Once the initial stop was made, the officer’s

observations of the defendant’s ducking motions and of parts of a concealed gun were grounds to

heighten the investigation.

                                         Statement of Relevant Facts4

         On December 18, 2004, at approximately 3:21 a.m., two Brockton police officers in a

marked cruiser observed a white motor vehicle fail to stop at an intersection where the officers

believed there was a stop sign (at the intersection of Pleasant Street and Oakdale Avenue).

Officers followed the car as it turned right onto Pleasant Street and then left onto Nye Avenue.

As the white vehicle turned to head south on Newbury Street, the officers activated the overhead

blue lights on the marked police cruiser to effect a stop of the white vehicle, which they then

pulled over (Ma. Reg. #56GB21 - Nissan Maxima).

         Prior to exiting the police cruiser, one officer clearly observed the back seat passenger

(later identified as the defendant) lean his body from the right side where he was sitting to the

left in what appeared to the officer to be nearly a fully horizontal position as if to retrieve or

conceal something. That officer then walked up to the driver's side of the vehicle while the other

officer walked up to the passenger's side of the vehicle. By then, the same rear passenger was



         3
          In response to the defendant’s assertions in his Motion, the government’s agent (see attached Affidavit 1)
and one of the arresting police officers met for the purpose of inspecting the site of the civil traffic violation which
had originally served as the basis for the stop. Having so investigated, it is now clear to the government that no
“stop sign” is currently in place at the intersection where the vehicle in which the defendant was riding as a
passenger was stopped by the police. Nor is there any “painted” stop sign on the street surface at the intersection.
         4
           The government anticipates that the testimony given by police officers at the evidentiary hearing in this
matter, to be scheduled, will support the facts asserted herein.

sitting upright.

        The officer on the driver's side then asked the driver for her identification and she

provided it to him, although she stated that she had no registration for the car. Hearing the

officer on the other side of the vehicle talking to the passenger in the rear and saying "oh, you've

done this before," the officer on the driver's side then shined his flashlight into the rear of the

vehicle and could then see what he recognized as the butt and trigger guard of a firearm

protruding from the floor on the driver's side of the rear passenger area of the vehicle. That

officer then signaled his finding to the other officer by holding up 4 fingers, at which point the

second officer called for backup.

        The two officers continued to converse with the passengers of the vehicle in an attempt

not to alarm them to their knowledge of the presence of the firearm until backup arrived. Shortly

thereafter, a backup officer arrived and approached the driver's side of the vehicle with his gun

drawn as the officer who had previously been on that side of the vehicle approached the right

passenger's side of the car. At that point, that officer told the rear seat passenger that he was

going to open the door and wanted that passenger to go directly to the ground outside of the

vehicle, which he then did (following the guidance of the officer). That passenger was secured

(cuffed) and then the driver and front passenger were also cuffed (in order to secure them). The

officer then fully illuminated the rear passenger (floor) area and could clearly see that a gun was

present on the floor and was closest to the rear passenger area (as opposed to the driver's area)

and the barrel of the gun was pointing in a direction opposite where the rear passenger had been

sitting (consistent with placing the weapon at such a location during his prior leaning motion).

        All three suspects were then arrested and brought to the police station for booking.

While the defendant was in the garage awaiting booking, an officer who was nearby observed

him reach into his pocket and pull something out and thrown it into a nearby trash barrel. That

officer then notified another nearby officer, who then went to the barrel and found an empty .357

rounds shell casing (subsequently identified by the police firearms' expert as being identical to

the rounds found in the gun (4 in count). The defendant then told the officer who found it that he

(Leslie) had just found the casing in the trash, had put it in his pocket, then was attempting to

discard it.

                                             Argument

I.      Police Officers had an Objectively Reasonable Basis for the Traffic Stop

        Law enforcement officers may permissibly stop an automobile and detain the driver

where there is probable cause to believe a traffic violation has occurred. See Whren v. United

States, 517 U.S. 806, 810 (1996), United States v. Bizier, 111 F.3d 214, 217 (1st Cir. 1997). In

determining whether probable cause existed, the officer’s subjective intent is irrelevant. Instead,

courts look to the “circumstances viewed objectively” to determine whether the action was

justified. Whren, 517 U.S. at 813, see also United States v. Andrade, 94 F.3d 9 (1st Cir. 1996).

        In this case, there was an objectively reasonable basis to conclude that the vehicle in

which the defendant was a passenger had violated a traffic law. The vehicle came to an

intersection of two streets that would normally involve a stop sign or painted stop line and the

automobile’s driver neglected to stop. One of the streets - actually a highway - was known to the

police officers to be quite busy with traffic most of the time, while the other (intersecting) street

was considerably less busy and more of a “side street.” The officers also knew that other streets

which similarly intersected the highway in the immediate vicinity were clearly marked with stop



                                                 -4-
        Case 1:05-cr-10052-RCL               Document 20             Filed 10/19/2005           Page 5 of 9



signs and/or painted stop lines. They had every reason to believe that this street - paralleling

almost precisely (in terms of traffic patterns) the other similarly situated streets - was marked by

a stop sign or painted stop line as well.

         An objective officer, viewing these circumstances in the position of the officers in this

case, could therefore quite reasonably believe that the failure to stop was a violation of the traffic

code.

         Whether there was an actual violation of traffic laws is sometimes of not determinative in

such circumstances, as long as the officer “reasonably believed it to be likely” that there was a

violation. United States v. Fox, 393 F.3d 52, 59 n6 (1st Cir. 2004).5 In Fox, an officer was

unable to determine whether the vehicle that he subsequently stopped was violating traffic laws

by not having a working license plate light. The court held that there was a “reasonable and

articulable suspicion” that a violation was occurring or had occurred, since the officer knew that

a working plate light was a requirement under the traffic laws, and it appeared to him that there

was not a working license plate light on the automobile. Id. at 59. The fact that the owner of the

automobile testified that the light was working shortly after “is of no consequence,” since the

stop was justified under the objective circumstances. Id. at 59 n6.

         Similar to the circumstances faced by the officer in Fox, the officers in this case knew it

to be a violation of the laws to fail to stop at a stop sign or stop line, and from their observations

of the automobile carrying the defendant, it was rational for them to stop the automobile for a



         5
           The judgment in this case was vacated and remanded to the First Circuit by the Supreme Court for further
consideration in light of United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. ---- (2005), a case decided on issues of sentencing. Fox v.
U.S., 125 S.Ct. 2949, 162 L.Ed.2d 864 (2005). It is expected that the law relating to automobile stops in the First
Circuit’s opinion will remain unchanged on remand.

failure to stop at an intersection where reasonably objective circumstances demonstrated that

there was likely to be a stop sign or line and where they believed that there was, in fact, such a

command to stop.

        A number of courts draw a distinction between a mistake of law and a mistake of fact in

assessing an officer’s traffic stop when it turns out that no traffic law was violated. “Under this

doctrine, ‘[a] traffic stop based on an officer’s incorrect but reasonable assessment of facts does

not violate the Fourth Amendment;’” “[b]ut ‘if an officer makes a traffic stop based on a mistake

of law, the stop violates the Fourth Amendment.’” United States v. Rowell, 2004 WL 555261 *4

(D.Mass. 2004), citing United States v. Chanthasouxat, 342 F.3d 1271, 1276 (11th Cir. 2003),

United States v. Twilley, 222 F.3d 1092, 1096 (9th Cir. 2000). The officers in this case were

clearly not making a mistake of law, since it is indeed a traffic violation in the state of

Massachusetts to fail to stop at a stop line or sign. If there is in fact no stop sign or line at the

intersection in question, the officers may have made a mistake of fact, but this does not

invalidate the traffic stop because the officers’ assessment of the facts was reasonable. It was

early in the morning, it was dark outside, and the intersection of the two streets was in a

configuration where there was likely to be a stop sign (particularly given the fact that one of the

streets is actually a highway).

        The defendant’s reliance on United States v. Sugar, 322 F.Supp.2d 85 (D.Mass. 2004) to

argue that a traffic stop where there is no violation is unreasonable is misplaced. Sugar can

readily be distinguished from the case at hand. That case involved an officer’s mistake of law.

The court held that the “one-time movement” of a trailer crossing the white line separating the

shoulder from the road was in fact “not a violation of the ... statute” and therefore “the initial



                                                   -6-
      Case 1:05-cr-10052-RCL           Document 20         Filed 10/19/2005       Page 7 of 9



stop was not reasonable or justified by probable cause.” Here, there is no allegation that it is in

fact not a violation of Massachusetts law to fail to stop at an intersection with a stop sign or stop

line. The officers were correct in their knowledge of the law, unlike the officer in Sugar.

II.    The Officer’s Observations of a Ducking Motion and Parts of a Weapon Justified the
       Scope of the Investigatory Stop

       Occurrences after an officer stops an automobile may justify heightened investigation of

a car and its occupants. United States v. Chienn, 266 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2001); Fox, 393 F.3d at

59. “[W]hile an officer’s actions must bear some relation to the purpose of the original stop, he

may shift his focus and increase the scope of his investigation by degrees if is suspicions mount

during the course of the detention.” Chienn, 266 F.3d at 6.

       Information developed in connection with a stop can give rise to grounds for a full

custody arrest. Bizier, 111 F.3d at 218. In Bizier, the state troopers initially stopped a motorist

for traveling ten miles over the speed limit, but upon their observations that it took Bizier longer

than usual to pull over, his eyes appeared to be affected, he was swaying, and he and the

passenger had inconsistent stories, the officers were justified in arresting him for driving under

the influence. Similarly, in this case, the officers observed a ducking and reaching motion by the

defendant following the stop of the vehicle, and they saw parts of a partially concealed weapon

when they came to talk to the occupants of the car following the initial stop. It was, under those

circumstances, reasonable for the officers to secure the occupants of the car and to perform a

search of the vehicle.

       A ducking motion, especially in light of other factors, can often form the basis for further

investigation. “[S]louching, crouching, or any other arguably evasive movement, when

combined with other factors particular to the defendant or his vehicle, can add up to reasonable


                                                 -7-
      Case 1:05-cr-10052-RCL           Document 20         Filed 10/19/2005       Page 8 of 9



suspicion.” United States v. Woodrum, 202 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2000). In Fox, following the

initial stop of the motorist, the officer noticed that the driver made “a ducking motion, as if

‘reaching out for something under the seat or placing something under the seat.’” 393 F.3d at 56.

That, in combination with the officer’s past experience with Fox and a large bulge in Fox’s

pocket, was sufficient to justify a frisk of Fox leading to an arrest for possessing a concealed

weapon. Id. at 59. The officer’s observations of the ducking motion, in combination with the

sight of a part of a gun, was enough to justify the officers’ order to the defendant to exit the

vehicle and the ensuing search.

                                            Conclusion

       Under Whren, officers may stop an automobile where they have probable cause to

believe a traffic violation has occurred. In this case, the objective circumstances, including the

configuration of the intersection (where one of the streets was actually a highway and

comparable surrounding intersections all had stop signs or painted stop lines), the time of

morning, the lack of light, and the distance of the vehicle from the officers, provided a

reasonable basis for the officers to conclude that a traffic violation had occurred. After the initial

stop, the officer’s observation of the defendant’s unusual crouching movement and of a partially

concealed gun in the automobile gave rise to justification for further investigation.

       Based on the foregoing, the government respectfully requests that the defendant’s Motion

to Suppress Evidence and Statements be denied.
