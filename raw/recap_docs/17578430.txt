William E. Smith, United States District Judge.

        Jose Luis Maldonado was convicted by a jury on February 25,

2011    of     one   count      of    possession         with   intent   to   distribute

cocaine      base    in     violation       of      21     U.S.C.    §   841(a)(1)     and

(b)(1)(A)(iii),           one    count      of      possession       with     intent   to

distribute heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and

(b)(1)(B)(i), one count of possession with intent to distribute

cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B)(ii),

one count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base

in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A)(iii), one

count     of    possession           with   intent       to     distribute    heroin   in

violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C), and one count

of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking

crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(i).                             Maldonado

moves the Court to vacate his conviction and order a new trial
pursuant to Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.1

As the basis for his motion, Maldonado contends that (1) he was

denied his counsel of choice, (2) the Court failed to grant his

request     for    a    continuance,    (3)   he    was   denied    his    right   to

testify in his own defense, and (4) the Court required him to

proceed to trial while incompetent.                (See generally Def’s. Mot.,

ECF   No.   92.)        For   the   reasons   set   forth    below,      Defendant’s

motion is denied.

      “The remedy of a new trial is rarely used; it is warranted

‘only where there would be a miscarriage of justice’ or ‘where

the   evidence         preponderates     heavily     against       the    verdict.’”

United States v. Andrade, 94 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir. 1996) (quoting

United States v. Indelicato, 611 F.2d 376, 386 (1st Cir. 1979));

accord United States v. Conley, 249 F.3d 38, 45 (1st Cir. 2001)

(“The remedy of a new trial must be used sparingly, and only

where a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result.”).

I.    Discussion

      A.     Denial of Counsel of Choice and of a Continuance

      During      the    weeks      leading   up    to    trial,    Maldonado      had

competent and prepared counsel whom he had previously selected

to represent him -- this attorney was the fourth attorney to

      1
       Maldonado also filed a motion for reconsideration (ECF No.
98) of this Court’s prior denial of his motion for new trial.
In light of this Court’s text order, dated August 15, 2011,
which   vacated  the   prior  denial,   Maldonado’s   motion  for
reconsideration is moot.
                                          2
represent him in this matter.        Just prior to the start of trial,

Maldonado asked the Court to allow another, new attorney to

represent him.      This new counsel of choice informed the Court

that he would not undertake the representation unless the Court

granted a one-month continuance.           The Court declined to grant

the continuance, and Maldonado’s new counsel of choice declined

to represent him.

     The   principles    governing   the    disposition     of   Maldonado’s

choice of counsel argument are simple and have been previously

articulated by the First Circuit:

     “[T]he essential aim of the [Sixth] Amendment is to
     guarantee an effective advocate for each criminal
     defendant rather than to ensure that a defendant will
     inexorably be represented by the lawyer whom he
     prefers.”   Wheat v. United States, 486 U.S. 153, 159
     (1988).    In particular, the right to choose one's
     counsel must be balanced against “the fair, efficient
     and orderly administration of justice . . . [and]
     cannot be manipulated to delay proceedings or hamper
     the prosecution.”   United States v. Panzardi-Alvarez,
     816 F.2d 813, 816 (1st Cir. 1987).    Indeed, “only an
     unreasoning     and    arbitrary    insistence    upon
     expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request
     for delay violates the right to the assistance of
     counsel.” Morris v. Slappy, 461 U.S. 1, 11-12 (1983)
     (internal quotation marks omitted).

United States v. Gaffney, 469 F.3d 211, 216 (1st Cir. 2006)

(second and third alteration in original) (emphases added).

     After no less than nine continuances and four attorneys,

the denial of yet another continuance to allow Maldonado to

retain   yet   another   attorney,   on   the   eve   of   trial,   does   not


                                     3
amount    to   “an    unreasoning     and    arbitrary     insistence       upon

expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request.”                  See id.

The Court is satisfied that the attorney Maldonado previously

had retained adequately represented2 him at trial and that the

denial of the requested continuance under the circumstances of

this case did not implicate Maldonado’s Sixth Amendment rights.

     B.    Maldonado’s Alleged Incompetency

     Maldonado       also    contends       that    certain      prescription

medications that he was taking at the time of trial rendered him

incompetent.     In    support   of   this    contention,       Maldonado   has

identified the prescription medications that he was taking and

the possible side effects one could experience from taking those

medications,    without     specifying    which    of   those    side   effects

Maldonado was experiencing or how they rendered him incompetent.



     2
       Maldonado attempts to further support his argument that
the denial of a continuance implicated his Sixth Amendment
rights with references to possible ineffective assistance of
counsel claims, stemming from a host of evidentiary issues and
concerns that Maldonado had previously raised in letters to the
Court.   “[A]n ineffective assistance claim is typically raised
in a collateral proceeding with the benefit of a more fully
developed record.” United States v. Lipscomb, 539 F.3d 32, 41
(1st Cir. 2008).       Moreover, Maldonado’s scant, undeveloped
references to these evidentiary concerns are simply insufficient
to satisfy his burden of showing that his trial counsel’s
representation    “fell    below  an   objective    standard   of
reasonableness” and to “overcome the presumption” that his
attorney’s decisions as to those issues represented “sound trial
strategy.”   Tevlin v. Spencer, 621 F.3d 59, 66 (1st Cir. 2010)
(quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 688-89 (1984)).

                                      4
       The time to have raised this issue was prior to or during

trial, and Maldonado has provided the Court with little basis on

which it could assess whether he was in fact incompetent at the

time    of    trial.    Maldonado’s       bold    assertions   and    conclusory

statements are therefore unavailing.

       C.     Maldonado’s Right to Testify in his own Defense

       Maldonado’s claim that he was denied his right to testify

in his own defense is predicated on three bases: (1) denial of

counsel      of   choice;   (2)   trial       counsel’s   allegedly   erroneous

advice regarding evidentiary issues; and (3) his incompetency

due    to    prescription   medications.         As   discussed   supra,   these

issues have been considered and deemed without merit.

II.    Conclusion

       For the foregoing reasons, the Defendant’s motion for a new

trial is DENIED.

IT IS SO ORDERED.
