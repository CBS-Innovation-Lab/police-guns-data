STATEl\’[ENT OF REASONS

Vll COURT DETERMINATIONS OF RESTITUTION
A m Restitution Not Applicable.
B Total Amount of Restitution:

C Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

l |:l For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663 A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under iii U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

2 l:\ F or offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex

issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would he outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3){B}.

3 l:l For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3663 andfor required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not

ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh
the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(l)(B)(ii).

4 I:l Restitution is not ordered for other reasons (Explain.)

D ij Partial restitution is ordered for these reasons (18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)):

VIII ADDITIONAL FACTS JUSTIFYING THE SENTENCE IN THIS CASE (If applicable.)

and there is no proof that the defendant personally was armed. The other involved an attempted robbery with a "shiny obje_ct."
Therefore, the court found that the defendants criminal history overstated the seriousness of his criminal conduct and, in v¢ew of his
tearml allocution about the importance to him of his daughters and the likelihood that with drug treatment he would be less likely to
commit crimes in the future. The court departed by 2 offense levels, to level 21, and by l criminal history category, to V. lt imposed a
70 month sentence, which the government argued was sufficient but no more than necessary before Probation belatedly discovered that
the attempt was a second crime ofviolence.

Sections I, II, III, IV, and VII of the Statement of Reasons form must be completed in all felony cases.
