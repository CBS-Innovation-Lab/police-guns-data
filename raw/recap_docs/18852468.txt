                               MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
11
             On April 12, 2012, Defendant Kenny Torres-Colon (“Torres”) was indicted for being a
12
     convicted felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition. (See Docket No. 16.) As described by
13
     the government, Torres was a passenger in a speeding vehicle and was observed throwing a firearm
14
     and fanny pack out the window onto the highway. (See Docket No. 83 at 2.) After collecting the
15
     evidence, consisting of the firearm, seventy-two rounds of ammunition and five magazines, it was
16
     sent to the Institute of Forensic Sciences of Puerto Rico (the “Institute”) for ballistic testing. (See
17
     id. at 3.) The evidence was not subjected to fingerprint testing. (See id.) The items were eventually
18
     transferred to Torres’ expert for fingerprint testing. (See id.) In anticipation of the results from
19
     Torres’ expert, the government moved to exclude any evidence regarding the fingerprint analysis.
20
     (Docket No. 83.) Torres’ opposed and motioned for dismissal of the indictment. (Docket No. 89.)
21
     After reviewing the parties’ submissions and the pertinent law, the court DENIES the government’s
22
     motion to exclude (Docket No. 83) and DENIES the Torres’ motion to dismiss (Docket No. 89).
23
     I.      Standard of Review
24
             Rule 402 of the Federal Rules of Evidence states, “[r]elevant evidence is admissible unless
25
     any of the following provides otherwise: the United States Constitution, a federal statute, these rules;
26
     or other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court. Irrelevant evidence is not admissible.” FED. R.
27
     EVID. 402. The test for relevant evidence is, “(a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less
28
           Case 3:12-cr-00286-GAG Document 90 Filed 08/12/13 Page 2 of 4

 1   probable than it would be without the evidence; and (b) the fact is of consequence in determining
 2   the action.” FED. R. EVID. 401. Relevant evidence may be inadmissible because its probative value
 3   is outweighed by its unfair prejudicial value, confuses the issues or misleads the jury. See FED. R.
 4   EVID. 403. In conducting a Rule 403 analysis the court only seeks to avoid unfair prejudice, because
 5   all evidence is designed to be prejudicial in some capacity. See U.S. v. Varoudakis, 233 F.3d 113,
 6   122 (1st Cir. 2000).
 7   II.    Discussion
 8          A.      Motion to Exclude at Docket No. 83
 9          The government seeks to exclude Torres’ fingerprint report because it would confuse the
10   jury. (See Docket No. 83 at 5 (“This will only cause confusion to the potential members of the jury
11   and should be excluded as allowed under Fed. Rules Evid. 403 . . . .”).) The court disagrees. The
12   results are relevant and will not confuse the jury. The lack of fingerprints on the firearm and
13   ammunition are relevant to whether Torres possessed those items. The fact that no fingerprints were
14   recovered from the items will not confuse the jury. In fact, it will be important evidence for the jury
15   to consider when deciding whether Torres committed the crime of possessing these items. The
16   government argues that the lack of fingerprints is completely expected and normal, while at the same
17   time argues that such evidence is confusing. The government will be given the opportunity to
18   explain to the jury why no fingerprints were found and how latent fingerprints are rarely found on
19   firearms and ammunition during trial. But the proposition that no fingerprints were found is not
20   confusing. Juries are entrusted to grasp fingerprint analysis and weigh the evidence, even in more
21   complicated cases. See e.g., U.S. v. Hernandez-De La Rosa, 606 F. Supp. 2d 175, 187 (D.P.R.
22   2009). Therefore, the court DENIES USA’s motion to exclude evidence regarding Torres’ expert’s
23   fingerprint analysis.
24          B.      Motion to Dismiss the Indictment at Docket No. 89
25          Torres’ motion to dismiss the indictment raises some serious concerns for the court.
26   Ultimately, Torres does not have the right to require the government to perform fingerprint analysis

 1   on evidence. Courts have held a defendant has a constitutional right to have an expert examine
 2   evidence for fingerprints when the government intends to demonstrate the defendant’s identity
 3   through fingerprint analysis. See U.S. v. Thomas, 216 F.3d 1089, T. at *2 (10th Cir. 2000) (“A
 4   appellant’s constitutional right to a fingerprint expert thus only arises upon a threshold showing that
 5   proof of the perpetrator's identity through fingerprint evidence is likely to be a significant factor at
 6   trial.”). That is not the case here as the government admits there are no fingerprints on the evidence.
 7   Torres had the right to have its own expert examine the evidence for fingerprints, which was allowed
 8   and the tests were performed. The lack of fingerprints is an issue Torres may use when defending
 9   the issue of possession.
10           As argued by the government, there was a need to collect this evidence from the roadside.
11   Certainly, no responsible police officer could allow a handgun and dozens of rounds of ammunition
12   be left unattended along the highway. But it seems the officers took no precautions to preserve the
13   evidence. The government does not even attempt to explain the surrounding circumstances that
14   forced the officers to retrieve the evidence with their bare hands.
15           Torres seeks dismissal of the entire case due to the improper handling of the evidence. (See
16   Docket No. 89.) Due to the lack of fingerprints, the government will have to rely on other evidence
17   to prove possession, such as eye-witness accounts of the events. That evidence is not tainted by the
18   handling of the evidence. Torres has the right to impeach any testimony with questions regarding
19   the proper handling of evidence and can rely on the lack of fingerprints to support its arguments.
20   It will be up to the jury to hear all the testimony and make credibility determinations. The court shall
21   not exclude the evidence or dismiss the case.
22   II.     Conclusion
23           For the foregoing reasons, the court DENIES the government’s motion to exclude fingerprint
24   testimony (Docket No. 83) and DENIES Torres’ motion to dismiss the indictment (Docket No. 89).
