       REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
      ON PETITIONER’S MOTION UNDER
     TITLE 28 U.S.C. § 2255 TO VACATE,
     SET ASIDE, OR CORRECT SENTENCE
      BY A PERSON IN CUSTODY (#495)
COLLINGS, U.S.M.J.
                               I. Introduction



     The petitioner Enrique Agosto (“petitioner” or “Agosto”) seeks to vacate
his conviction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Agosto pled guilty to heroin-
related offenses and was sentenced to 188 months in prison. He did not appeal
his conviction. In his petition, Agosto raises four ineffective assistance of
counsel claims, including a claim that his trial counsel failed to file a notice of
appeal despite Agosto’s express instruction that he wished to appeal. The
government argues at the threshold that Agosto’s petition is untimely, and that
the plea agreement contains waivers that preclude Agosto’s claims.
Alternatively, the government contends that the claims should fail on the merits.
                       II. Factual and Procedural Background



      Agosto was arrested on October 15, 2004 in connection with his
participation in a heroin distribution organization in Massachusetts. (## 8, 21)
Agosto signed a plea agreement pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C), in
which he agreed to plead guilty to Count I of the Superseding Indictment,
charging conspiracy to distribute heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 846 and
841(a)(1). (   See   # 448) In the plea agreement, Agosto stipulated to possessing
at least 400 grams but less than 700 grams of heroin, and he agreed that the
base offense level was 28. ( at 2) Further, Agosto stipulated that he was a
                                Id.



career offender and that therefore his career offender offense level was 34 with
a criminal history category of VI. ( ) With a reduction for acceptance of
                                         Id.



responsibility, his base offense level was 31 which yielded a guidelines
sentencing range of 188 to 235 months. At the change of plea hearing, the

                                           2
government stated that it would recommend a sentence at the low end of the
range. (  See   #573, Transcript of Plea at 7) Agosto also agreed to waive his right
to file a direct appeal or to challenge collaterally his guilty plea or the
imposition of the sentence agreed to by the parties. (#448 at 4)
      At the change of plea hearing conducted on December 6, 2007, the
district court reviewed the terms of the plea agreement (    see #   573 at 5-6), and
twice inquired whether anyone had made any promises or assurances to Agosto
in an effort to make him plead guilty, (id. at 6, 8-9). Agosto replied, “no.” (Id.
at 6, 9) The district court inquired whether Agosto understood that “for all
practical purposes, by virtue of the plea agreement, you have waived your right
to appeal any sentence?” Agosto replied, “Yes, I do.” (Id. at 11) The
government presented a summary of the evidence it would present if the case
proceeded to trial, and Agosto agreed with the summary of the facts. The
district court detailed the rights that Agosto would be relinquishing in pleading
guilty, and found that Agosta was fully competent and capable of entering an
informed plea and that his plea of guilty was knowing and voluntary. (Id. at 11-
12, 16)
      At sentencing on March 6, 2008, the district court observed that “the

                                           3
guidelines range would have been 262 to 327 months but for the fact that
counsel have entered into a binding plea agreement wherein they both
mistakenly understood the guidelines range to yield a range of 188 to . . . 235
months[.]” (#505, Transcript of Disposition) Despite the miscalculation, the
district court accepted the plea and sentenced Agosto to 188 months, the low
end of the guideline range.
      On September 25, 2009, Agosto filed a Motion Under Title 28 U.S.C. §
2255 to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence by a Person in Federal Custody
(#495), challenging his conviction and sentence on four grounds: 1) that trial
counsel was ineffective in failing to file a notice of appeal; 2) that trial counsel
was ineffective in failing to move for a downward departure at sentencing based
on the argument that the career offender designation overstated the seriousness
of Agosto’s criminal history; 3) that trial counsel was ineffective in advising
Agosto to accept the plea deal and telling Agosto that if he went to trial he
would be sentenced to life in prison; 4) that trial counsel was ineffective in
failing at sentencing to seek an adjustment for Agosto’s minor role in the
offense. (See #495 at 6-8, 12-13) On October 23, 2009, the government filed
its Response to Defendant’s Motion Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 and Request


                                         4
for Summary Dismissal (#502), and subsequently a Supplemental Response to
Defendant’s Motion Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (#508). On November 13,
2009, Agosto filed a Reply Brief in Support [of] Petitioner’s Motion to Vacate,
Set Aside or Correct a Sentence Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §[] 2255 (#509), along
with an Affidavit. On December 11, 2009, Agosto filed a Reply Brief to
Government’s Supplemental Response to Defendant’s Motion Pursuant to 28
U.S.C. §[] 2255 (#512).
                                  III. Discussion



      The government has moved to dismiss the petition summarily on the
grounds that it is untimely; that the waivers contained in the plea agreement
preclude habeas relief; and that the claims, in any event, are without merit. The
Court considers these arguments seriatim.
                  A. The Timeliness of the Habeas Petition
      AEDPA provides for a one-year limitations period. Generally, a section
2255 petition must be filed within one year of “the date on which the judgment
of conviction becomes final.” 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f)(1). Where no notice of
appeal was filed, as here, the triggering event for statute of limitations purposes
is the expiration of the time for filing an appeal. See Randy Hertz & James S.


                                        5
Liebman, 1        Federal Habeas Corpus Practice and Procedure                , § 5.2[b][I], at 272 (6th
ed. 2011).1 The district court sentenced Agosto on March 6, 2008, and entered
judgment on April 3, 2008. (              See   #455, Judgment) Under the Federal Rules
extant at the time relevant here, a direct appeal should have been filed within
ten days after the entry of judgment. And so, Agosto’s conviction became final,
at the latest, on April 17, 2008, and the one-year limitations period expired one
year later, on April 17, 2009. Agosto filed his section 2255 petition on
September 25, 2009, slightly more than five months after the one-year
limitations period expired. Agosto does not dispute this calculation. Instead,
he argues that his late filing should be excused under equitable tolling
principles. Alternatively, although Agosto has not argued the point, the Court
considers whether the petition may yet be timely under 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f)(4).


            1.   Equitable Tolling
        “[T]he timeliness provision in the federal habeas corpus statute [28 U.S.C.
§ 2244(d)] is subject to equitable tolling.” Holland v. Florida, 130 S. Ct. 2549,

        1

         During the time frame at issue here, the time for filing an appeal expired ten days after the judgment
is entered. A judgment is “entered” “when it is entered on the criminal docket.” Fed. R. App. P. 4(b)(6).
In this case, the judgment was entered on April 3, 2008. Using the method of calculation extant at the time,
Agosto had until April 17, 2008 to file a notice of appeal.
                                                      6
2554 (2010); see also Ramos-Martínez v. United States, 638 F.3d 315, 322 (1      st




Cir. 2011) (extending Holland to 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f)). Nevertheless, “equitable
tolling should be invoked only sparingly.” Ramos-Martínez, 638 F.3d at 322
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). “A habeas petitioner bears the
burden of establishing the basis for equitable tolling,” id. at 323 (internal
quotation marks and citation omitted), and must show “‘(1) that he has been
pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance
stood in his way and prevented timely filing,’” id. (quoting Holland, 130 S. Ct.
at 2562 (further internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Moreover,
“[a] party seeking equitable tolling must have diligently pursued his rights for
the entire period he seeks tolled, not merely once he discovers the underlying
circumstances warranting tolling.” Neves v. Holder, 613 F.3d 30, 36 (1 Cir. st




2010), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 3025 (2011).
      In his affidavit, Agosto avers that “[a]t sentencing, in open court[,] [he]
told the court that [he] did not want to appeal [his] sentence.” (#509-2 at 1)
He further avers that after sentencing, he met with his counsel in a holding cell,
where his counsel explained his appeal rights. (Id.) Agosto states that he told
his counsel to appeal his sentence, and that his counsel stated that he would file

                                        7
a notice of appeal when he got back to his office. (Id.) Agosto further
maintains that in April 2008, he wrote his attorney a letter asking about the
status of his appeal. (Id.) He avers that he received no response to this letter,
and that he wrote additional letters to his counsel again in August and
November 2008, but those letters also went unanswered. (Id.) He then states
that he “got fed up,” and called his counsel’s law offices in November and
December of 2008, but was always told that his counsel was “unavailable.” (Id.)
He then waited until March 2009, when he again wrote his counsel inquiring
about the status of his appeal; he states that this letter also went unanswered.
(Id.) Finally, he avers that “a few months ago” (the Court assumes roughly
August 2009), he wrote a final letter to his counsel requesting return of his files,
and he was informed that his trial counsel had died of cancer in March 2009.
(Id.)
        Agosto argues that his attorney’s failure to file a direct appeal prevented
petitioner from filing a timely section 2255 petition. (See #509 at 2) Although
Agosta does not flesh out this argument, the Court assumes that Agosto’s
argument runs as follows: his late filing should be excused because he thought
that his counsel had filed a notice of direct appeal on his behalf, and that his

                                         8
appeal had been pending during the 17 months before he had filed his section
2255 petition. (See #495 at 6) Thus, Agosto’s argument seems to go, he was
unaware that the clock had begun ticking on his federal habeas petition until
he learned that his attorney had passed away a few weeks before he filed his
habeas petition.
        In the Court’s view, the facts that Agosto recounts, even if true,2 do not
establish reasonable diligence sufficient to warrant equitable tolling. The
petitioner essentially contends that he had no contact with his counsel during
the year that he thought that his direct appeal was pending, and that he
received no response from counsel to the letters that he wrote during the
months after his counsel had allegedly filed a notice of appeal. Petitioner
should have and could have taken some other affirmative action to protect his
rights, such as by requesting a copy of the docket from the court, or seeking
some other assistance from the court in order to ascertain the status of his
appeal. Instead, the petitioner contends that he waited a period of months and
then wrote again. It was not reasonable for petitioner to assume that nothing
        2

        In the Court’s view, it is inherently incredible that Agosto would have waived his appeal rights at
the end of the sentencing hearing, only to express a change of heart immediately afterwards. This is
especially so because his attorney must have also explained the implications of the appeal waiver. Agosto
does not detail what his counsel said to him that could have led him to change his mind. Nevertheless, for
the reasons set out below, the Court does not rest resolution of the petition on this conclusion alone.
                                                    9
was awry when his attorney, according to Agosto, failed to respond. Nor was
it reasonable for Agosto to assume that counsel was, in fact, pursuing an appeal
several months beyond the date on which the notice should have been filed,
when his counsel failed to contact him with details about the appeal. In short,
Agosto should have known that something was amiss during the one-year
limitations period, and the actions he recounts, even if true, do not bespeak
reasonable diligence. Cf. Williams v. United States, No. 10-22897, 2011 WL
1878124, at *2 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 25, 2011) (“Indeed, the absence of any response
from counsel (as movant alleges) would have put a reasonable prisoner on
notice that some other steps should be taken to determine the status of his
appeal.”), report and recommendation adopted, 2011 WL 1878126 (S.D. Fla.
May 17, 2011). The situation might be different if his attorney had responded
and had represented that an appeal was in the works, lulling the petitioner into
inaction. But here Agosto alleges that he heard nothing from his attorney, and
this averment effectively dooms his argument.
      2. Timeliness under 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f)(4)
      Although Agosto has not argued the point, his claims (assuming, favorably
to Agosto, that all the claims asserted could benefit from this provision) may yet


                                       10
be timely under 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f)(4), which triggers the running of the
statute of limitations on “the date on which the facts supporting the claim or
claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due
diligence.” Under this provision, then, a section 2255 motion might be timely
if the petitioner filed within one year of discovering, through the exercise of due
diligence, that counsel did not file the requested appeal. Thus, the task “‘is to
determine when a duly diligent person in petitioner’s circumstances would have
discovered that no appeal had been filed.’” Anjulo-Lopez v. United States, 541
F.3d 814, 818 (8th Cir. 2008) (quoting Wims v. United States, 225 F.3d 186, 190
(2d Cir. 2000)). This provision presents a closer question because due diligence
would not have required Agosto to inquire about his counsel’s pursuit of an
appeal in April 2008, the very day on which his conviction became final absent
appeal, and the statute of limitations would not have begun to run until
sometime after that day. See Wims, 225 F.3d at 190. Here, Agosto avers that
he wrote his attorney in April, August and November of 2008, never receiving
a response. One might readily conclude that Agosto could have learned the
status of his appeal by taking affirmative action after his attorney failed to
respond not once but twice to his letters. Thus, based on Agosto’s own


                                        11
averments, after Agosto sent the first letter in April 2008 with no response,
reasonable diligence would have required Agosto to make further inquiry during
the lapse of four months before he took any additional action. Cf. Williams,
2011 WL 1878124, at *2 (“due diligence requires that once [petitioner’s] first
purported letter to counsel went unanswered, that he have requested a copy
of his criminal docket.”).
      Even so, determining when a petitioner should have discovered that his
counsel failed to file a notice of appeal is fact-specific and “depends, among
other things, on the details of [his] post-sentence conversation with his lawyer
and on the conditions of his confinement.” Wims, 225 F.3d at 190-91.
Resolution of the issue here is additionally complicated because Agosto’s trial
counsel passed away in March 2009. And courts have reached very different
results in resolving this precise issue. Compare Anjulo-Lopez, 541 F.3d at 818
(concluding that defendant failed to exercise due diligence in failing to discover
counsel had not filed appeal “at any time after the deadline for filing the appeal
passed”), with Wims,225 F.3d at 191 (concluding that “five-month delay” before
petitioner discovered that his counsel had failed to file a direct appeal “is not so
clearly unreasonable that it plainly appears from the face of appellant's petition

                                        12
and supporting papers that he is barred from habeas relief”). Because the Court
cannot say that the record conclusively establishes that Agosto should have
discovered his counsel’s alleged lapse during the five-month period after the
time for filing a notice of appeal, the Court instead considers the government’s
alternative arguments.
                B. The Effect of the Plea Agreement Waivers
      The government also makes the threshold argument that Agosto’s claims
are barred by the waiver provision contained in the plea agreement, which
states as follows:
            6. Waiver of Rights to Appeal and to Bring Collateral
            Challenge
            Defendant is aware that he has the right to challenge
            his sentence and guilty plea on direct appeal.
            Defendant is also aware that he may, in some
            circumstances, be able to argue that his plea should be
            set aside, or his sentence set aside or reduced, in a
            collateral challenge (such as pursuant to a motion
            under 28 U.S.C. § 2255).
            In consideration of the concessions made by the U.S.
            Attorney in this Agreement, Defendant knowingly and
            voluntarily waives his right to appeal or collaterally
            challenge:
            (1) Defendant’s guilty plea and any other aspect of
            Defendant’s conviction, including but not limited to,
            any rulings on pretrial suppression motions or any
            other pretrial dispositions of motions and issues; and
            (2) The imposition by the District Court of the sentence
            agreed to by the parties, as set out in paragraph 4, even
                                       13
            if the Court rejects one or more positions advocated by
            the parties with regard to the application of the U.S.
            Sentencing Guidelines.
#448, Plea Agreement at 4.
       There are a few problems with the government’s argument. Agosto raises
a claim in his petition that his counsel was ineffective during the plea
bargaining process. The weight of authority holds that "waivers of appeal
remain valid unless the ineffective assistance directly related to the knowing,
voluntary nature of the waiver." United States v. White, 307 F.3d 336, 341 (5th
Cir. 2002) (discussing cases). And the First Circuit has noted that even if a
waiver is found to be knowing and voluntary, a claim that the plea proceedings
themselves were infected by constitutionally deficient assistance of counsel
could fall within “the miscarriage of justice exception” that would permit a court
to decline to enforce a waiver. See United States v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14, 25 n.9
(1 Cir. 2001). The same holds true for waivers of collateral-review rights:
  st




although such waivers are generally enforceable if knowing and voluntary, a
wealth of authority holds that "[a] defendant's plea agreement waiver of the
right to seek section 2255 post-conviction relief does not waive defendant's right
to argue, pursuant to that section, that the decision to enter into the plea was


                                       14
not knowing and voluntary because it was the result of ineffective assistance of
counsel." DeRoo v. United States, 223 F.3d 919, 924 (8th Cir. 2000) (collecting
cases).
      Because Agosto correctly notes that he has raised a claim asserting that
his counsel was ineffective during the plea-bargaining process, the Court
concludes that the proper course is to examine the merits of that argument, and
then to assess the enforceability of the waivers and their effect on the remaining
claims.
                          C. The Merits of the Claims
      Agosto asserts four substantive claims in his habeas petition, all alleging
that his counsel rendered constitutionally inadequate representation. He
contends that: 1) trial counsel was ineffective in failing to file a requested
notice of appeal; 2) trial counsel was ineffective in failing to argue at sentencing
that Agosto’s career offender designation overstated the seriousness of his
criminal history; 3) trial counsel was ineffective in advising Agosto that he
would receive a life sentence if he proceeded to trial; 4) trial counsel was
ineffective in failing to move for a sentencing adjustment to reflect Agosto’s
minor role in the offense.


                                        15
      The ineffective assistance of counsel claims are governed by the standard
set out in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984), "which requires
proof both that counsel fell below minimum standards of representation and
that there is a reasonable probability that the deficiency altered the outcome of
the case." Robidoux v. O'Brien, 643 F.3d 334, 338 (1st Cir.), cert. denied sub
nom., Robidoux v. Murphy, 132 S. Ct. 866 (2011). The Sixth Amendment right
to counsel “extends to the plea-bargaining process.” Lafler v. Cooper, 132 S. Ct.
1376, 1384 (2012).       And "the same two-part standard . . . appli[es] to
ineffective-assistance claims arising out of the plea process." Hill v. Lockhart,
474 U.S. 52, 57 (1985). In the context of guilty pleas, where the defendant
"enters his plea upon the advice of counsel, the voluntariness of the plea
depends on whether counsel's advice 'was within the range of competence
demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.'" Id. at 56 (quoting McMann v.
Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 771 (1970)). The prejudice requirement "focuses on
whether counsel's constitutionally ineffective performance affected the outcome
of the plea process. In other words, in order to satisfy the 'prejudice'
requirement, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability
that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have

                                       16
insisted on going to trial." Id. at 59 (footnote omitted). Under Strickland, “[a]
reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the
outcome.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694.
1. Ineffectiveness of counsel during the plea process
      In Ground 3 of his petition, Agosto alleges that his trial counsel was
ineffective during the plea process because his counsel advised Agosto that if he
proceeded to trial he would receive a life sentence. Agosto claims that he would
have risked going to trial if his counsel had properly explained the guidelines
sentencing range to which he would have been exposed. Agosto avers:
                   Attorney McCann told me during the plea
            negotiations that if I went to trial, I would receive a
            sentence of LIFE in prison period. He told me that the
            Judge I was in front of love[d] giving life sentences
            and never goes below the advisory guidelines ranges.
            Attorney McCann told me not to go to trial or I would
            get LIFE in prison. Attorney McCann never discussed
            what my advisory guideline range would be if I did go
            to trial, had I known the Guideline range, I would have
            gone to trial.

(#509-2 at 2-3)
Thus, he contends that if he had known that the guideline sentencing range
would have been 235 to 293 months, he would have insisted on going to trial.


                                        17
(#495 at 12)3
        First, the Court notes that counsel would not have been incorrect in
advising Agosto that the maximum penalty at stake in this case was life in
prison, as that was the case. (See #573 at 9) Agosto effectively alleges,
however, that his counsel assured him that he would receive a life sentence if
he went to trial. But even accepting, as the Court must, that Agosto’s behind-
the-scenes representation is true, and assuming that his counsel’s statement to
him satisfies the performance prong of Strickland, Agosto has failed to establish
that but for counsel's purported error in incorrectly advising him, there is a
reasonable probability that Agosto would not have entered into the plea
agreement and would have insisted on going to trial. A review of the record
makes this clear.
        The government's proffered evidence at the plea colloquy included the
following: Agosto was arrested with over 22 grams of heroin on his person.
(#573 at 13) The government also offered details through Title III wiretap
evidence and pager intercepts that Agosto would have been held accountable
for 598 grams of heroin. (See id. at 14-15) In his petition, Agosto has offered
        3

        In fact, the properly calculated guidelines range was 262 to 327 months (see #505 at 9), but the
detail has no effect on the analysis.
                                                   18
no contrary version of facts, or any defense that would suggest a reasonable
probability that he would have risked trial in the face of this evidence.
      In pleading guilty, Agosto received not only the benefit of a three-point
reduction in his total offense level, but also the benefit of a sentence that was
miscalculated in his favor. The properly calculated guidelines range would have
been 262 to 327 months. The plea agreement recommended an incorrect
guideline range of 188 to 235 months, and the government recommended the
bottom of this range. (See #454 Government’s Sentencing Memorandum at 4;
see #573 at 7) Thus, on the record before the Court and in the absence of any
countervailing argument, the Court concludes that Agosto has failed to establish
that he would not have pled guilty but for his counsel's misrepresentation.
      A review of the plea colloquy further undercuts Agosto’s claim. After the
government detailed the sentence contemplated in the plea agreement, the
district court asked Agosto whether anyone had “made any other or different
promise or assurance to you of any kind in an effort to make you plead guilty
in this case?” (#573 at 6) Agosto replied “no.” (Id.) In this context, Agosto’s
counsel disclosed to the court that he told Agosto that he was “experienced with
this Court,” and that “that this Court is conservative in nature but is very open-


                                       19
minded about various issues that may come up as it relates to sentencing.” (Id.
at 8) On the heels of this disclosure, the district court again inquired: “[J]ust
so the record is clear, I’ll ask Mr. Agosto again. Has anyone made any other or
different promise or assurance, from anything you’ve heard here this afternoon,
in an effort to make you plead guilty in this case?” (#573 at 8-9) Again,
Agosto responded “no.” (Id. at 9) The colloquy continued, with the court
inquiring “[h]as anyone attempted in any way to force you to plead guilty in
this case.” (#573 at 9) Agosto again responded “no.” (Id.) Agosto may have
interjected at this point, but he did not. “[A] court is entitled to give weight to
the defendant's statements at his change-of-plea colloquy absent a good reason
for disregarding them.” United States v. Santiago Miranda, 654 F.3d 130, 138
(1st Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). “Moreover, a
defendant’s ‘declarations in open court carry a strong presumption of verity.’”
Id. (quoting Blackledge v. Allison, 431 U.S. 63, 74 (1977)). Agosto has not
overcome that presumption.
      Finally, the district court made plain that it was not bound by the
sentence proposed in the plea agreement, and that it had “the discretion to
sentence [Agosto] anywhere in the range set forth in the statute . . . and that [it

                                        20
was] not required to sentence [him] within the range prescribed in the
sentencing guidelines or based upon factors contained in those guidelines.”
(#573 at 10) When queried whether he understood, Agosto replied, “Yes.” (Id.)
The district court further advised Agosto that it could “impose a sentence that
is more severe or less severe than those called for in the guidelines” and then
asked: “Do you understand that?” (Id. at 10-11) Again, Agosto stated that he
did. Thus, Agosto was fully apprised that, despite the plea agreement, the
district court could have imposed a more severe sentence, and he persisted in
his guilty plea nonetheless. The plea colloquy thus undercuts Agosto’s
contention that, but for his counsel’s purported representations, he would not
have pled guilty.
2. The effect of the waivers on the remaining claims
      Having rejected any argument that Agosto’s plea was not knowing or
involuntary on account of ineffective assistance of counsel, the court returns to
the question of the effectiveness of the waivers. An appeal waiver is
presumptively enforceable if it is entered into knowingly and voluntarily. See
Teeter, 257 F.3d at 24. A three-pronged test applies to determine knowledge
and volition: “First, the written plea agreement must clearly set forth the scope

                                       21
and terms of the waiver. Second, the district court, at the change-of-plea
hearing, must call the waiver to the defendant’s attention and question him
closely in order to ensure that he has a full understanding of the waiver
provisions and that he has knowingly and voluntarily elected to waive his right
of appeal. Third, even if the plea agreement and the change-of-plea colloquy
pass muster, we will not enforce the waiver if doing so would work a
miscarriage of justice.” United States v. Gil-Quezada, 445 F.3d 33, 36 (1st Cir.
2006) (citations omitted).
      Here, the plea agreement meets the first prong: the agreement clearly and
unambiguously provides that the defendant voluntarily and knowingly waives
his right to appeal and to collaterally challenge “his guilty plea and any other
aspect of his conviction” and “imposition by the District Court of the sentence
agreed to by the parties, as set out in paragraph 4.” The sentence imposed falls
squarely within the scope of this waiver. Cf. Sotirion v. United States, 617 F.3d
27, 34 (1st Cir. 2010) (examining similar language in plea agreement). The
district court specifically called attention to the waiver of appeal rights. The
district court inquired: “Do you understand that under some circumstances the
government may appeal any sentence that I impose, but for all practical


                                       22
purposes, by virtue of the plea agreement, you have waived your right to appeal
any sentence; do you understand that?” (#573 at 11) Agosto responded, “Yes,
I do.” (Id.) And although the district court did not specifically inquire into the
waiver of collateral review rights, the First Circuit has stated that “[a]lthough
it would have been preferable for the . . . judge to specifically refer to the waiver
of the right to collateral challenge as well as the waiver of the right to direct
appeal, the judge’s inquiry adequately confirmed [the defendant’s]
understanding that he was giving up the important right to challenge his
sentence after conviction.” Sotirion, 617 F.3d at 35. Cf. also United States v.
Ciampi, 419 F.3d 20, 26-27 (1st Cir. 2005) (enforcing waiver of appellate and
collateral-review rights despite court’s failure to make specific inquiry where
totality of the circumstances make plain that defendant understood the nature
and scope of the waiver), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1217 (2006). Finally, the Court
concludes that it would not constitute a miscarriage of justice to enforce the
waiver in this case. “The miscarriage of justice standard ‘requires a strong
showing of innocence, unfairness, or the like, and is ‘demanding enough to
prevent defendants who have agreed to waive their right to appeal from
successfully pursuing garden-variety claims of error.’” Sotirion, 617 F.3d at 36

                                         23
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, the defendant received
the benefit of his bargain, which included a miscalculated sentence that inured
to his benefit.
a. Claims of ineffectiveness at sentencing
      Because the Court concludes that the waivers ought to be enforced, the
Court also concludes that two of the grounds presented in Agosto’s petition
necessarily fail: his claims in Ground 2 and 4 that his counsel was ineffective at
sentencing in failing to move for an adjustment for Agosto’s minor role in the
offense, and in failing to challenge Agosto’s career offender designation. These
represent garden-variety challenges to Agosto’s sentence, and they are plainly
precluded by the waivers. Furthermore, Agosto’s counsel would not have been
ineffective in failing to raise these challenges at sentencing, as such a challenge
could have voided the plea agreement.




                                        24
b. Failure to file notice of appeal
      Finally, Agosto contends that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to
file a notice of appeal, despite Agosto’s request that he do so. Ordinarily, under
the standard established in Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470, 477 (2000), “a
lawyer who disregards specific instructions from the defendant to file a notice
of appeal acts in a manner that is professionally unreasonable.” Id. at 477.
Flores-Ortega further establishes that, under such circumstances, a defendant
need not establish prejudice: “by instructing counsel to perfect an appeal, [a
defendant] objectively indicated his intent to appeal and was entitled to a new
appeal without any further showing.” Id. at 485. Agosto seeks to situate his
claim in this category.
      Flores-Ortega did not address the circumstances in which a defendant has
expressly waived appeal rights in a plea agreement. See Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S.
at 488 n.1 (Souter, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part) (“there is no claim
here that Flores-Ortega waived his right to appeal as part of his plea
agreement”). See also United States v. Mabry, 536 F.3d 231, 240 (3rd Cir. 2008)
(noting that Flores-Ortega did not address whether presumption of prejudice
applies or whether Flores-Ortega controls, “where the defendant has waived his

                                        25
right to appellate and collateral review”), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 2789 (2009).



The law, however, has evolved on this point following F                       lores-Ortega, and the
circuits are currently split on whether Flores-Ortega obliges trial counsel to file
a notice of appeal if asked to do so when the defendant has entered into a plea
agreement waiving appeal rights. See United States v. Falcon, No. 07-147-ML,
2011 WL 777852, at *5 (D.R.I. Feb. 28, 2011) (collecting cases).4 Thus far, the
First Circuit has not had occasion to address the question.
        Under the majority view, Flores-Ortega controls even in circumstances in
which a defendant has waived the right to appeal. Under this view, if a
defendant, despite the waiver, requests counsel to file an appeal, counsel must
oblige by filing a notice of appeal and then an Anders brief if counsel believes
that the waiver would render an appeal frivolous. See, e.g., Campusano v.
United States, 442 F.3d 770, 773, 777 (2d Cir. 2006) (Sotomayor, J.)
(concluding that the “Flores-Ortega presumption of prejudice applies to a
defendant who has waived appeal in a plea agreement” and that counsel must

        Compare United States v. Poindexter, 492 F.3d 263, 273 (4th Cir. 2007); United States v. Tapp, 491

United States, 546 F.3d 450 (7th Cir. 2008).

discharge obligations under Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967)). Under
the minority view, the majority rule applies Flores-Ortega “to a situation in
which it simply does not ‘fit.’” Mabry, 536 F.3d at 241. Under this view, the
validity of the waiver ought to be the threshold issue when a petitioner claims,
despite waiving appeal rights, that counsel was ineffective in failing to file a
notice of appeal. Id. at 242. And, “[o]nce a defendant has waived his right to
appeal not only in writing but also in open court under Rule 11(b)(1)(N), the
sixth amendment does not require counsel to disregard the waiver. The
regimen of Strickland applies: the defendant must show both objectively
deficient performance and prejudice. Unless a non-frivolous issue could be
raised on appeal, counsel should protect the client’s interest in retaining the
benefit of the plea bargain.” Nunez v. United States, 546 F.3d 450, 456 (7th Cir.
2008).
      In the Court’s judgment, the minority view is persuasive. As the Seventh
Circuit noted in Nunez, “[w]aivers are enforced even if a defendant changes his
mind. . . . Instead of being obliged to follow his client’s (latest) wishes,
however unreasonable they may be, a lawyer has a duty to the judiciary to
avoid frivolous litigation . . . . A lawyer also has a duty to his client to avoid

                                       27
taking steps that will cost the client the benefit of the plea bargain.” Nunez, 546
F.3d at 454-55. A number of district courts have since adopted this approach.
See, e.g., Falcon, 2011 WL 777852, at *7 (“the presumption of prejudice
espoused in Flores-Ortega does not apply to Falcon’s ineffective assistance claim
. . ., given the full and complete colloquy conducted by [the court] and the
appeal waiver provision signed by [the defendant]”); Blacksher v. United States,
No. 11-cv-11826, 2011 WL 5854373, at *4 (E.D. Mich. Oct. 13, 2011)
(approving minority view and concluding that defendant’s “unfulfilled request
for counsel to file a direct appeal should not preclude enforcement of
[defendant’s] direct appeal waiver”), report and recommendation adopted, 2011
WL 5854341 (E.D. Mich. Nov. 18, 2011); United States v. Walls, No. 05-92,
2008 WL 927926, at *8 (E.D. Ky. April 4, 2008) (noting weight of authority but
holding that “a complete waiver of appeal rights removes [the] case from the
scope of Flores-Ortega” and, alternatively, holding that “the presumption of
prejudice in Flores-Ortega is rebutted in this case by the existence of a valid
waiver of appeal rights”).
      Here, having concluded that the waivers contained in the plea agreement
are enforceable, and having rejected as meritless Agosto’s claim that the plea

                                        28
process was tainted by ineffectiveness of counsel, the Court shall recommend
that Agosto’s claim that his counsel was ineffective in failing to file a notice of
appeal be denied, especially where the issues presented are squarely precluded
by the waivers.
   IV. Conclusion, and Recommendation and Alternative Recommendation
      For all the above reasons, I RECOMMEND that petitioner’s Motion Under
Title 28 U.S.C. § 2255 to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence by a Person in
Federal Custody (#495) be DENIED. However, should the District Judge adopt
the majority view that if a defendant, despite the waiver, requests counsel to file
an appeal, counsel must oblige by filing a notice of appeal, I ALTERNATIVELY
RECOMMEND that the District Judge appoint counsel pursuant to Rule 8(c) of
the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings, and conduct an evidentiary
hearing on the question whether Agosto, in fact, specifically requested his trial
counsel to file a notice of appeal.
                        V. Review by the District Judge
      The parties are hereby advised that any party who objects to this
recommendation and alternate recommendation must file specific written
objections thereto with the Clerk of this Court within 14 days of the party’s


                                        29
receipt of this Report and Recommendation. The written objections must
specifically identify the portion of the recommendations, or report to which
objection is made and the basis for such objections. The parties are further
advised that the United States Court of Appeals for this Circuit has repeatedly
indicated that failure to comply to file objections shall preclude further
appellate review. See Keating v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 848
F.2d 271 (1st Cir. 1988); United States v. Emiliano Valencia-Copete, 792 F.2d 4
(1st Cir. 1986); Scott v. Schweiker, 702 F.2d 13, 14 (1st Cir. 1983); United
States v. Vega, 678 F.2d 376, 378-379 (1st Cir. 1982); Park Motor Mart, Inc. v.
Ford Motor Co., 616 F.2d 603(1st Cir., 1980); see also Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S.
