 ORDER AFFIRMING RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE


     The United States Magistrate Judge filed with the court on August 27,

2010, with copies to counsel, his Recommended Decision on Motion to

Suppress. The defendant filed his objection to the Recommended Decision on

October 7, 2010. I have reviewed and considered the Recommended Decision,

together with the entire record including the transcript and the exhibits

including the DVD of the stop. I have made a de novo determination of all

matters adjudicated by the Recommended Decision; and I concur with the

recommendations of the United States Magistrate Judge for the reasons set

forth in the Recommended Decision.

     It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the Magistrate

Judge is hereby ADOPTED. The defendantâ€™s motion to suppress is DENIED.

     SO ORDERED.

     DATED THIS 18TH DAY OF OCTOBER, 2010
