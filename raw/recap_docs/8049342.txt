                 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                   FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND


UNITED STATES OF AMERICA                  :

             GOVERNMENT’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO
     DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE AND STATEMENTS

                              INTRODUCTION

     The defendant contends that the Court should suppress all

evidence obtained as result of the defendant’s arrest on the

grounds that law enforcement officers seized both the defendant

and evidence in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United

States Constitution.    The defendant’s arguments are without

merit.

                                  FACTS

     On October 31, 2006, Task Force Agent (TFA) Michael Naylor,

with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Taskforce,

received information from a cooperating source (CS) that the

defendant would be delivering a kilogram of cocaine to a

residence on Alto Street at 3:00 pm.          He also told TFA Naylor

that the defendant had another kilogram of cocaine.              The CS said

the defendant would deliver one kilogram of cocaine in the

defendant’s vehicle which had a license plate of GJ-345.               He also

told TFA Naylor that the defendant would have another male with

him to “have his back.”
  Case 1:06-cr-00130-S-LDA   Document 27   Filed 01/31/2007   Page 2 of 20



     From past experience, TFA Naylor knew the CS to be a

reliable source of information.      Information from the CS has lead

to the arrest and conviction of at least 10 suspects on both

federal and state charges.     Additionally, the CS has testified

under oath before.

     The information TFA Naylor received from the CS on October

31, 2006 was corroborated by information that TFA Naylor had been

receiving over the previous two months.       Namely, that an

individual known as “Bori,” sells kilogram quantities of cocaine

and sells marihuana.    From the information received, TFA Naylor

was able to identify “Bori” as the defendant, Jeffra DeJesus, and

identify the vehicle operated by and registered to the defendant.

     On October 31, 2006, after receiving the information from

the CS, TFA Naylor requested that a Cranston police cruiser

conduct a car stop of the defendant, who was traveling in his

vehicle with the plate GJ-345.      Officer Davis, with the Cranston

Police Department, pulled behind the defendant in a marked

cruiser, and Detective Paul Saccoccia pulled his unmarked car in

front of the defendant’s car.      Officer Davis activated his lights

and attempted to stop the defendant.       The defendant, however,

accelerated and tried to evade Officer Davis by maneuvering

around Detective Saccoccia’s vehicle.       The defendant was not able

to get around Detective Saccoccia’s vehicle and was forced to

stop.


                                   -2-
  Case 1:06-cr-00130-S-LDA   Document 27   Filed 01/31/2007    Page 3 of 20



     As the officers approached the vehicle, the defendant and

his “back-up,” Alan DeJesus-Quinones, were removed from the

vehicle, handcuffed and asked to sit on the curb.             Detective

Saccoccia looked through the window and saw a blue bag pulled

tightly around what appeared to be a brick of narcotics.             The

brick was laying on the floor behind the passenger seat.

Detective Saccoccia seized the brick, discovered that it did in

fact contain cocaine and placed the defendant and Alan DeJesus-

Quinones under arrest.

     During a search of the vehicle, the officers located a

hidden compartment in the dashboard which contained 17 bags of

cocaine.   They also seized five cell phones from the vehicle.

     The DEA agents arrived shortly after the vehicle stop.               TFA

Naylor read the defendant his Miranda rights, and began to

question the defendant.      The defendant admitted that he was on

his way to deliver a kilogram of cocaine.        The defendant also

admitted that he left his residence at 66 Osborn Street to make

this delivery.   He then gave the agents consent to search his

house as long as he could accompany them back to his house.               He

told the agents he had the keys to the house on his key ring in

the car.   The keys were seized and later used to gain entry to

the defendant’s house.

     During a search of the house, the defendant directed TFA

Naylor to the bathroom where a gun was hidden.         TFA Naylor was


                                   -3-
     Case 1:06-cr-00130-S-LDA   Document 27   Filed 01/31/2007   Page 4 of 20



unable to find the gun, but then another TFA discovered a secret

compartment behind the medicine cabinet.           Inside this

compartment, the agents found cash, ammunition and a revolver

with an obliterated serial number.

       While transporting the defendant back to the police station,

the defendant made admissions to TFA Naylor.            Once back at the

station, the defendant waived his Miranda rights for the second

time that day.      He then made even more admissions regarding his

drug dealing.

       The defendant now moves to suppress all evidence seized and

all statements made by him to law enforcement.

                                   ARGUMENT

I.    THE POLICE LAWFULLY STOPPED AND DETAINED THE DEFENDANT.

       The defendant argues that the initial stop of his motor

vehicle and his subsequent detention by the officers and agents

was unlawful; however, the officers’ and agents’ actions

constituted a valid stop and detention based upon the existence

of probable cause, or at least reasonable suspicion, to believe

that the defendant possessed contraband at that time.




                                      -4-
  Case 1:06-cr-00130-S-LDA   Document 27     Filed 01/31/2007   Page 5 of 20



     A.     The Agents Had Probable Cause to Believe That the
            Defendant Possessed Contraband at the Time of the Motor
            Vehicle Stop.

         Probable cause for a warrantless arrest exists if the

collective knowledge1 of the officers involved was sufficient to

lead a prudent person to believe that the defendant was

committing or had committed an offense.         United States v. Link,

238 F.3d 106, 109 (1st Cir. 2001).         Probability, not proof beyond

a reasonable doubt, is the touchstone of the probable cause

determination.     See United States v. Aguirre, 839 F.2d 854, 857-

58 (1st Cir. 1988).     Thus, the officer’s conclusion need not be

“ironclad,” or “even highly probable.”         See Winchenbach, 197 F.3d

at 555-56.     Rather, the arrest is justified if the circumstances

known at the time support the officer’s reasonable belief that

the action taken was appropriate.        Logue v. Dore, 103 F.3d 1040,

1044 (1st Cir. 1997).

     Where, as here, the probable cause determination relied upon

informant information, the Court must conduct a totality of the

circumstances analysis when determining if that information

establishes probable cause to arrest.         Illinois v. Gates, 462

U.S. 213 (1983).     Several factors to be considered in making that

determination are the informant’s past performance and


     1
      In following the collective knowledge rule, the Court
should consider the aggregate information available to all
officers involved in the investigation when determining what was
known by the officers at a particular time. See United States v.
Winchenbach,197 F.3d 548, 555 (1st Cir. 1999).

                                   -5-
  Case 1:06-cr-00130-S-LDA   Document 27   Filed 01/31/2007   Page 6 of 20



relationship to authorities, the officer’s attempts to

corroborate the information provided, the informant’s basis of

knowledge, and law enforcement’s experience and expertise in

reaching conclusions from the informant’s information.            See

United States v. Barnard, 299 F.3d 90, 93-95 (1st Cir.

2002)(explaining when an informant’s information sustains a

magistrate’s finding of probable cause in the context of a search

warrant); see also United States v. Khounsavanh, 113 F.3d 279,

284-87 (1st Cir. 1997).

     The officers must attempt to corroborate an informant’s

information under the totality of the circumstances.           United

States v. Capozzi, 347 F.3d 327, 333 (1st Cir. 2003), cert.

denied, 540 U.S. 1168 (2004).      That corroboration, however, must

be sufficient to only reduce, not wholly eliminate, the

probability that the informer is either lying or inaccurate.

Khounsavanh, 113 F.3d at 284.      Moreover, the more reliable the

informant, the less corroboration needed to sustain a finding of

probable cause.   See id.; see also United States v. Sandoval-

Espana, 459 F.Supp.2d 121, 131 (D.R.I. 2006).

     In this case, the CS was known to TFA Naylor.            The CS began

working with DEA several years prior to the day in question, and

had provided reliable information numerous times in the past.

While working for DEA, the CS’s information resulted in the

arrest or conviction of more than ten people.         Furthermore, the


                                   -6-
  Case 1:06-cr-00130-S-LDA   Document 27   Filed 01/31/2007   Page 7 of 20



CS testified truthfully in the trial of at least one of those

individuals.   Also, the CS served as one of the sources

underlying an affidavit supporting an application for a wiretap.

In short, by the time the CS provided information to TFA Naylor

on October 31, 2006, the CS had proven himself time and again to

be a reliable informant.

     Additionally, the CS demonstrated a solid basis of knowledge

when the CS relayed the information to TFA Naylor.            The CS

personally spoke with the defendant on October 31, 2006, and knew

the defendant would be delivering a kilogram of cocaine because

the CS had agreed to purchase the kilogram of cocaine from the

defendant.

     The CS also provided information with enough detail so as to

enhance the reliability of that information.         The CS identified

the vehicle in which the defendant would travel, the number of

occupants that would be in the vehicle, the reason the defendant

would have a second person with him, the quantity of cocaine the

defendant would deliver, the time it would be delivered and the

location of the delivery.     Furthermore, the information TFA

Naylor had received about the defendant over the previous two

months corroborated the information TFA Naylor received from the

CS on October 31, 20062.


     2
     TFA Naylor had received information that the defendant was
a cocaine dealer. Upon receipt of that information the agents
were able to identify the defendant’s vehicle.

                                   -7-
  Case 1:06-cr-00130-S-LDA   Document 27    Filed 01/31/2007   Page 8 of 20



      Most significantly, however, the defendant’s actions on

October 31, 2006 corroborated the information received from the

CS.   See Draper v. United States, 358 U.S. 307, 313 (1959)

(agents had probable cause to arrest based upon specific,

detailed information from a known, reliable informant, who

predicted the defendant’s actions).        Namely, that the defendant

would be traveling, with a companion to “watch his back,” to Alto

Street, at 3:00 pm, in a particular vehicle.          Just as in Draper,

all the CS said would happen leading up to the traffic stop did

happen.    It is not inconceivable that the last piece of

information - that the defendant had a kilogram of cocaine -

would also prove to be true.      This seemed even more likely after

the defendant attempted to evade the officers’ efforts to stop

his vehicle.    See Illinois v. Wardlow, 528 U.S. 119, 124 (2000)

(“Headlong flight - wherever it occurs - is the consummate act of

evasion: It is not necessarily indicative of wrongdoing, but it

is certainly suggestive of such.”).

      B.    Even if the Court Finds That the Agents did not Have
            Probable Cause to Arrest, the Stop of the Defendant’s
            Vehicle was Supported by Reasonable Suspicion.

      Pursuant to Terry v. Ohio, “‘a police officer may in

appropriate circumstances and in an appropriate manner approach a

person for purposes of investigating possibly criminal behavior

even though there is no probable cause to make an arrest.’”

United States v. Trueber, 238 F.3d 79, 91 (1st Cir. 2001)


                                   -8-
  Case 1:06-cr-00130-S-LDA    Document 27   Filed 01/31/2007   Page 9 of 20



(quoting Terry, 398 U.S. 1, 22 (1968) (internal quotations and

citations omitted)).    The officer may “stop and briefly detain

the person for investigative purposes, and diligently pursue a

means of investigation likely to confirm or dispel [his]

suspicions quickly.”    Id.    These “investigatory powers include

stopping motor vehicles upon reasonable suspicion.”            United

States v. Taylor, 162 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 1998) (citing

Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032, 1049 (1983)).          The validity of

such Terry stops is governed by a two prong test: “whether the

officer’s actions were justified at their inception,” and, if so,

whether the actions taken by the officers following the stop were

reasonably responsive to the circumstances justifying the stop in

the first place as augmented by information gleaned by the

officers during the stop.      Taylor, 162 F.3d at 18; United States

v. Jackson, 918 F.2d 236, 238-39 (1st Cir. 1990).

     To satisfy the test’s first prong, “<the police officer must

be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken

together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably

warrant [the] intrusion.’”      Taylor, 162 F.3d at 18 (quoting

United States v. Kimball, 25 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1994)) (quoting

Terry, 392 U.S. at 21).      Put another way, “[w]arrantless

investigatory stops are allowable if, and to the extent that,

police officers have a reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing - a

suspicion that finds expression in specific, articulable reasons


                                    -9-
  Case 1:06-cr-00130-S-LDA   Document 27     Filed 01/31/2007   Page 10 of 20



for believing that a person may be connected to the commission of

a particular crime.”     United States v. Lee, 317 F.3d 26, 31 (1st

Cir.) (citing Terry, 392 U.S. at 21), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 1048

(2003).

      The reasonable suspicion required for a Terry stop may be

based on information received from an informant known to the

police as well as from an informant whose identity is unknown.

Alabama v. White, 496 U.S. 325 (1990); Taylor, 162 F.3d at 19.

When a credible informant warns of a specific pending crime, the

police should be able to respond appropriately, i.e., to conduct

a brief investigatory stop and detention of the suspect.               Adams

v. Williams, 407 U.S. 143, 147-148 (1972).           Therefore, the test

becomes whether a prudent law enforcement officer would

reasonably conclude based upon the informant’s information, as

well as any available corroboration, that the likelihood existed

that the suspect was probably engaged in criminal activity.               See

United States v. Diallo, 29 F.3d 23, 26 (1st Cir. 1994) (quoting

United States v. Chapdelaine, 616 F.Supp. 522, 526 (D.R.I.

1985)).

     As noted above, the second prong of the Terry test requires

a showing that “<the action taken [by police] was reasonably

related in scope to the circumstances which justified the

interference in the first place.’”          Taylor, 162 F.3d at 20

(quoting Terry, 392 U.S. at 20).          Whether this standard is met


                                   -10-
  Case 1:06-cr-00130-S-LDA   Document 27     Filed 01/31/2007   Page 11 of 20



“requires a fact specific inquiry into whether the measures used

were reasonable in light of the circumstances that prompted the

stop or that developed during its course.”           United States v.

Acosta-Colon, 157 F.3d 9, 15 (1st Cir. 1998).

     Here, the initial police action was limited in scope and

duration, making it most reasonable under the circumstances.                The

officers first ordered the defendant out of the vehicle, which is

a permissible request after a proper motor vehicle stop.

Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U.S. 106 (1977); Maryland v. Wilson,

519 U.S. 408 (1997).

     The same analysis applies to the agents’ use of handcuffs.

The fact that the agents handcuffed the defendant after he was

removed from his vehicle does not automatically convert that

encounter into a de facto arrest.          See United States v. Fornia-

Castillo, 408 F.3d 52, 65 (1st Cir. 2005)(holding that neither

the use of handcuffs nor the drawing of a weapon turned a Terry

stop into a de facto arrest since the stop took place on a busy

street, with a high volume of traffic and the officer was alone);

United States v. Quinn, 815 F.2d 153, 157 n.2 (1st Cir. 1987);

see also United States v. Zapata, 18 F.3d 971, 976 (1st Cir.

1994)(stating that the right to make an investigatory stop

“‘necessarily carries with it the right use some degree of

physical coercion.’”).       Police officers engaged in a lawful stop

are permitted to take measures, including the use of handcuffs,


                                    -11-
  Case 1:06-cr-00130-S-LDA   Document 27   Filed 01/31/2007   Page 12 of 20



to reasonably protect themselves and others from harm.            See

Acosta-Colon, 157 F.3d at 18 (recognizing that handcuffs do not

necessarily convert an investigatory stop into a de facto arrest,

although ruling in this particular case, handcuffing the

defendant pursuant to procedure as opposed to in response to

safety concerns, in conjunction with a detention that caused

defendant to miss his flight, did amount to a de facto arrest);

United States v. Hamlin, 319 F.3d 666, 671-72 (4th Cir.

2003)(“[T]he use of handcuffs did not convert the encounter into

a custodial arrest because the use was reasonably necessary to

protect the officer’s safety.”).

     Such protective measures are especially necessary when the

defendant is suspected of engaging in drug distribution

activities, because “law enforcement officers know from

experience that firearms are often found in the presence of

illegal drugs.”    Jackson, 918 F.2d at 240 (citing United States

v. Walters, 904 F.2d 765, 769 (1st Cir. 1990) (“in drug

trafficking, firearms have become ‘tools of the trade’”)).

     In this case, as stated in section IA, TFA Naylor received

detailed information regarding the defendant’s drug dealing that

was to a large extent corroborated by events.          In addition, the

officers conducting the stop observed the defendant attempt to

flee from Officer Davis as he activated his lights.           See Wardlow,

528 U.S. at 124 (“Headlong flight - wherever it occurs - is the


                                   -12-
  Case 1:06-cr-00130-S-LDA   Document 27   Filed 01/31/2007    Page 13 of 20



consummate act of evasion: It is not necessarily indicative of

wrongdoing, but it is certainly suggestive of such.”); United

States v. Goncalves, No. 06-062ML (D.R.I. January 17, 2007)

(order denying motion to suppress).        At a minimum, the officers

had reasonable and articulable suspicion that justified the stop

of the defendant’s vehicle.

     Furthermore, the agents were well within the boundaries of

reasonable behavior in handcuffing the defendant.             See United

States v. Ivery, 427 F.3d 69, 73 (1st Cir. 2005) (“[T]he

circumstances under which the officers acted are to be viewed

through the eyes of a reasonable and cautious police officer on

the scene, guided by his experience and training.”).             The

defendant had tried to escape.      See Lee, 317 F.3d at 31-32

(noting that attempted flight made a “world of difference” in the

analysis of whether a Terry stop was transformed into a defacto

arrest).   The defendant’s actions in conjunction with the

information regarding the defendant’s drug dealing warranted the

handcuffs.   To not take such a simple precaution as handcuffing

the defendant during a Terry stop such as this would have been

rash and foolish.

     C.    Even if the Court Finds That The Agents Did Not Have
           Probable Cause to Arrest Prior to the Traffic Stop of
           the Defendant’s Vehicle the Agents Had Probable Cause
           to Arrest the Defendant After the Traffic Stop.

     Defendant Saccoccia arrested the defendant after observing

the brick of cocaine on the floor of his vehicle.             Certainly,

                                   -13-
  Case 1:06-cr-00130-S-LDA    Document 27   Filed 01/31/2007   Page 14 of 20



after stopping the defendant, and observing what appeared to be a

brick of cocaine on the floor behind the passenger seat,

Detective Saccoccia had sufficient knowledge to lead a prudent

person to believe that the defendant was committing or had

committed an offense.        See Link, 238 F.3d at 109.

II.   THE SEARCH OF THE DEFENDANT’S VEHICLE AND RESULTING
      DISCOVERY OF THE ADDITIONAL NARCOTICS WAS LAWFULLY CONDUCTED
      PURSUANT TO THE AUTOMOBILE EXCEPTION.

      The same corroborated informant information that provided

the officers with the probable cause to arrest the defendant

justified the warrantless search of the defendant’s vehicle.

Once the officers had probable cause to believe that the vehicle

the defendant was driving contained contraband, they were free to

search it without first obtaining a warrant.          United States v.

Lopez, 380 F.3d 538, 543 (1st Cir. 2004).          Furthermore, the

permissible scope of that search included not only the vehicle

itself, but also any containers found within, such as the safe.

California v. Acevedo, 500 U.S. 565, 579-80 (1991).

      The automobile exception justifies a warrantless search of a

motor vehicle regardless of whether there was time to obtain a

warrant, or whether the search occurred after the vehicle was in

police custody.    “[S]o long as the vehicle search is supported by

probable cause, no particular exigency (beyond the inherent

mobility of any motor vehicle) need exist.”          United States v.

Panitz, 907 F.2d 1267, 1271 (1st Cir. 1990).          That is, although


                                     -14-
  Case 1:06-cr-00130-S-LDA   Document 27   Filed 01/31/2007   Page 15 of 20



the officers might have had time to secure a warrant, there is no

requirement that they do so.      See id. at 1271 (“the existence of

probable cause justifies a warrantless seizure and reasonable

search of a motor vehicle lawfully stopped in transit or parked

in a public place, whether or not exigent circumstances prevailed

at either the time of the seizure or the time of the search.”).

In fact, “law enforcement personnel who have probable cause to

believe there is contraband in an automobile may nevertheless

conduct a warrantless search, ‘even after [the vehicle] has been

impounded and is in police custody.’” United States v.

Chapdelaine, 616 F.Supp. 522, 529 (D.R.I. 1985) (quoting Michigan

v. Thomas, 458 U.S. 259, 261 (1982)), aff’d, 795 F.2d 75 (1st

Cir. 1986); see United States v. McHugh, 769 F.2d 860 (1st Cir.

1985) (upholding a search of a vehicle one week after its

seizure).

     In the case at hand, the defendant contests the officers’

search of the vehicle at the scene of the traffic stop3.            He


     3
      The "brick" of cocaine was observed by Detective Saccoccia
while he was standing outside of the vehicle and looking through
the rear passenger window. This observation was not a search or
a seizure. See Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730, 740 (1983) (“There
is no legitimate expectation of privacy . . . shielding that
portion of the interior of an automobile which may be viewed from
outside the vehicle by either inquisitive passersby or diligent
police officers.”) (citations omitted). Furthermore, the fact
that the brick of cocaine was wrapped in a blue plastic does not
negate its significance for purposes of probable cause. See id.
at 743 (“The fact that [the officer] could not see through the
opaque fabric of the balloon is all but irrelevant: the
distinctive character of the balloon itself spoke volumes as to

                                   -15-

argues that the officers should have obtained a warrant prior to

searching his vehicle; however, the law, as discussed above, does

not support the defendant’s contention.         Quite simply, because

the officers had probable cause to believe there was contraband

in the vehicle, they were entitled to search the defendant’s

vehicle pursuant to the automobile exception.

     Furthermore, the automobile exception extends to the more

thorough search of the vehicle conducted after the discovery of

the brick.    See Panitz, 907 F.2d at 1271; McHugh, 769 F.2d at 865

(automobile exception justified a search one week after seizure

of the vehicle); Chapdelaine, 616 F.Supp. at 528 (“A search for

cocaine [pursuant to the automobile exception] could logically

take the officers into every nook and cranny of a vehicle,

including the luggage.”).        This search resulted in the discovery

of 17 additional bags of cocaine packaged for distribution and

five cellular phones.        TFA Naylor had been told that the

defendant had two kilograms of cocaine, and only one kilogram had

been found.   The agents had every reason to believe there was

more cocaine in the vehicle, or alternatively in the defendant’s

house.

III. THE DEFENDANT VOLUNTARILY CONSENTED TO A SEARCH OF HIS
     RESIDENCE.

     “In order to be effective, a person’s consent to a search



its contents - particularly to the trained eye of the officer.”).

                                     -16-
  Case 1:06-cr-00130-S-LDA    Document 27    Filed 01/31/2007   Page 17 of 20



must be freely and voluntarily given.”          United States v. Coraine,

198 F.3d 306, 309 (1st Cir. 1999).          “Voluntariness turns on a

number of factors, including the person’s ‘age, education,

experience, intelligence, and knowledge of the right to withhold

consent.’” Id. (quoting United States v. Barnett, 989 F.2d 546,

555 (1st Cir. 1993)).        “The court can also consider ‘whether the

consenting party was advised of his or her constitutional rights

and whether permission to search was obtained by coercive means

or under inherently coercive circumstances.’” Id.; cf. United

States v. Blais, 98 F.3d 647, 650-51 (1st Cir. 1996) (“[W]hile

the failure to inform an individual that he has a right to

withhold consent is a factor to be weighed in determining the

issue of voluntariness, such a failure does not preclude a

finding of valid consent.”).

     In this case, the defendant argues that his consent to

search was involuntary because he was told that his wife would be

charged with possession of any drugs found in the house.               This

assertion is not true.       At least two agents were present when the

defendant gave consent to search his home, and neither of them

heard the defendant’s wife threatened.

     Even if the defendant’s contention were true, it does not

vitiate his consent.     In Jackson, 918 F.2d at 242, while

addressing the voluntariness of the defendant’s confession, the

First Circuit recognized that a voluntariness determination



                                     -17-
  Case 1:06-cr-00130-S-LDA   Document 27   Filed 01/31/2007   Page 18 of 20



requires the court to “look at the totality of the circumstances,

including any promises or threats made by police officers or the

prosecution, in order to see whether the will of the accused was

overborne.”

     At the time the defendant gave consent, the defendant was 29

years old.    He had already had his Miranda rights read to him,

and he had waived those rights.       The defendant had been

cooperative with the agents and had given a statement about his

cocaine delivery.    Furthermore, the defendant’s actions

themselves, i.e., directing the agents to his keys, and then to

the bathroom once at his house, all weigh in favor of a

determination of voluntariness.       Considering all of the factors,

the Court should find the defendant’s consent voluntary.             See,

e.g., United States v. Mitchell, 209 F.3d 319, 324 (4th Cir.

2000)(finding defendant’s consent to be voluntary in light of his

age, past arrests, and willingness to tell the police exactly

where they could find the firearm even though defendant was

arrested at gunpoint, not given Miranda warnings and not advised

of his right to refuse consent).

                               CONCLUSION

     For the reasons set forth above, the United States

respectfully requests that this Honorable Court deny the

defendant’s Motion to Suppress.
