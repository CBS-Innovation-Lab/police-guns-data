                         MOTION FOR SENTENCE CONSIDERATION


       Now comes William Williams, the Defendant in the above captioned matter, and moves this
Honorable Court, pursuant to Local Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 (2006), to consider and impose
a sentence that is sufficient, but not greater than necessary, in compliance with18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).
After considering all the appropriate information present in this case, the Court should conclude that
the advisory guidelines call for a sentence longer than what is sufficient to comply with 18 U.S.C.
§ 3553(a). Mr. Williams requests the Court impose a sentence of 54 to 66 months in prison, which
will be sufficient in this case to satisfy the purposes of sentencing.

                        MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF SENTENCING

I.       Introduction
         Mr. Williams respectfully submits this memorandum to assist the Court in determining a
sentence “sufficient but not greater than necessary” to achieve the statutory purposes of sentencing.
18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) (2005). Additionally, Mr. Williams submits this memorandum in support of
his Motion for Sentencing Consideration advocating for a sentence outside of the suggested
guideline range. The Court is required to sentence a defendant below the advisory guideline range
if such a sentence is sufficient to achieve the purposes of sentencing. Id. Mr. Williams requests the
Court to consider imposing a sentence of 54 to 66 months of incarceration. The proposed sentence
adequately addresses society’s needs of punishment and deterrence without being longer than
necessary.


II.      Procedural Background
         On May 18, 2006, the Providence Police arrested Mr. Williams after finding the charged
firearm pursuant to a search warrant. Mr. Williams was held by the State of Rhode Island at the
ACI. The government obtained this indictment on July 12, 2006, and Mr. Williams made his initial
appearance before this Court on July 17, 2006. Mr. Williams pled guilty to this charge on October
10, 2006. Sentencing is presently scheduled for April 26, 2007.


III.     Sentencing Considerations

                                                  1
     Case 1:06-cr-00082-T-DLM             Document 19        Filed 05/03/2007       Page 3 of 7



       A.       General
       The Court is bound in its sentencing considerations by 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). The United
States Sentencing Guidelines are not the law and the Court is not bound by its suggested sentences.
United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 259 (2005). The statute, § 3553(a), requires the Court to
consider the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the
defendant, the kinds of sentence available, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparity, the
need to provide restitution, and the suggested guideline range. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1), (a)(3)-(7).
The primary sentencing mandate of § 3553(a) directs the sentencing court to impose the minimally-
sufficient sentence to achieve the statutory purposes of punishment—justice, deterrence,
incapacitation, and rehabilitation: “The court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than
necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in [18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)].” 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)
(emphasis added).1 This so-called “parsimony provision” is not simply a factor to be considered in
determining sentence; it represents a cap above which the Court is statutorily prohibited from
sentencing, even when a greater sentence is recommended by the sentencing guidelines. Cf., United
States v. Denardi, 892 F.2d 269, 276-77 (3d Cir. 1989) (Becker, J., concurring in part, dissenting in
part).2 If the Court feels a sentence below the guidelines supports the purposes of sentencing then
the Court must impose that particular sentence.
       The statutory language notwithstanding, the First Circuit has proclaimed that the advisory


       1
           The statute provides, in pertinent part, that:
“the court consider the need for the sentence imposed-
       (A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide
       just punishment for the offense;
       (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;
       (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and
       (D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care,
       or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner;”
18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2) (2005).
       2
          The precise meaning of the provision, however, is difficult to discern. See United
States v. Navedo-Concepcion, 450 F.3d 54, 58-59 (1st Cir. 2006) (pointing out that most of the
purposes of sentencing weigh negatively toward a defendant and that “there is no mathematical
algorithm for the perfect sentence.”).

                                                    2
     Case 1:06-cr-00082-T-DLM             Document 19         Filed 05/03/2007        Page 4 of 7



guideline range is not just a mere factor in the list above. United States v. Jimenez-Beltre, 440 F.3d
514, 518 (1st Cir. 2006); see also United States v. Thurston, 456 F.3d 211, 215 (1st Cir. 2006), United
States v. Smith, 445 F.3d 1, 4(1st Cir. 2006). The Circuit Court believes the guidelines should carry
more weight than the other considerations because they “represent the only integration of the
multiple sentencing factors set forth in § 3553(a), often reflect past practice, and bear the imprimatur
of the Sentencing Commission.” Thurston, 456 F.3d at 215 (quoting Smith 445 F.3d at 4). Beyond
the declaration of heightened importance, the guidelines are not presumptively or per se reasonable,
and still reflect generalizations in sentencing. Jimenez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 518. The Court made that
distinction seemingly to avoid the appearance of reestablishing a mandatory sentencing scheme. Id.
(as struck down in Booker). Unfortunately, the heightened influence of the guidelines, as well as the
sliding scale of justification for sentences outside of the guidelines3, continues to embrace and
support a de facto mandatory sentencing scheme.4
        This Court must guard against any de facto mandatory sentencing scheme. Booker, 543 U.S.
at 258-61 (mandatory sentencing schemes unconstitutional). While the guidelines incorporate a
number of sentencing factors, they do not include any analysis, evaluation, or consideration of an
individual’s unique characteristics; they are generalizations. See Jimenez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 518.
An individual’s background, character, and upbringing cannot be easily quantified in a guideline
system, nevertheless, the Court must consider that unique individual information. 18 U.S.C. §
3553(a). In short, the guidelines represent cookie cutter justice at its worst; one size does not fit all.
The Court must eschew general application of the advisory guidelines and consider all of the unique
characteristics of the defendant when determining this sentence. The sentencing judge is in the best




        3
          The First Circuit now requires greater justification for sentences outside of the advisory
guideline range depending on how much the sentence varies from the guideline. Thurston, 456
F.3d at 215 (citing Smith, 445 F.3d at 4).
        4
         In fact, the First Circuit has yet to reverse a guideline sentence as unreasonable while
reversing all below guideline sentences appealed by the government. See NYCDL Appendix to
Amicus Brief in Rita v. United States and Claiborne v. United States (excerpt attached; available
at www.nycdl.org (reasonableness review database).

position to evaluate individual defendants under § 3553(a) and determine the appropriate sentence.5
Mr. Williams presents ample circumstance to warrant the Court’s imposition of a sentence below
the advisory guideline range in this instance.
       B.      Personal Background
       Mr. Williams grew up in a single parent family with his mother and sister. The family was
poor, but his mother was always able to provide the necessities. His mother and sister still live in
Providence and are very supportive. Mr. Williams’s father lives in Providence as well, but William
does not enjoy a strong relationship with his father and never lived with him as a child. Mr.
Williams also has seven children here in Providence with whom he does have a strong relationship.
Although in custody since May, 2006, William does see his children often and did have a very strong
presence in their lives before his arrest. Mr. Williams wants to be assigned as close as possible to
Rhode Island in order not to lessen his contact with his children.
       Mr. Williams has a significant history of substance abuse, and he was exposed to his parents’
abuse as a child. Although his mother has been clean for 20 years, his father continues to struggle
with drugs. Mr. Williams has continuously used marijuana since he was 14 years old. He has also
used ecstacy, PCP, and prescription medication. He does drink alcohol on occasion, but believes he
is addicted to marijuana. Mr. Williams is looking forward to participating in drug treatment while
incarcerated with the BOP.
       Mr. Williams has been employed for most of his adult life. He has worked many different
jobs through temporary agencies, but also worked at Stop & Shop, Benny’s, and Hess Gas Company
in the last two years. Just prior to his arrest Mr. Williams was attempting to get his commercial
drivers license and a position with Swift Transportation.
       C.      Criminal History
       While Mr. Williams has a significant criminal record, the Court must recognize that the
advisory guidelines overstate the seriousness of his convictions. The guidelines place Mr. Williams


       5
        Comparing other § 3553(a) factors to advisory guidelines actually resembles the
comparison of apples to oranges because only the guidelines directly coincide with a time period;
the sentencing court must then look to the other factors to determine if that suggested period of
incarceration is appropriate under all of the circumstances in the case. Jimenez-Beltre, 440 F.3d
at 525 (Lipez, J., dissenting) (emphasis added).

                                                 4
      Case 1:06-cr-00082-T-DLM          Document 19          Filed 05/03/2007       Page 6 of 7



in CHC VI based on 13 criminal history points. Only 5 of those points relate to felony offenses.6
The advisory guidelines, however, fail to recognize or consider the very real difference in seriousness
between felony and misdemeanor offenses. Also, the guidelines fail to recognize or consider that
Mr. Williams’s felony convictions are 9 to 11 years old. All of his recent contacts with the criminal
justice system have been for misdemeanor offenses only. Under these circumstances, CHC VI is not
appropriate.
        E.     Nature of the Offense
        Possession of a firearm as a felon is a serious offense. The advisory guidelines here,
however, do not take into account certain mitigating facts and suggest a sentence longer than
necessary. First, the Court should consider that this gun was locked up inside of a safe, inside a
closet, unloaded, rather than being carried about on Mr. Williams’s person or stashed in the
apartment for convenient use. Second, the guidelines, U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1, add 4 points to the offense
level for Mr. Williams’s prior convictions; a 1995 robbery and a 1998 cocaine possession (a
probationary sentence). The net result is an advisory sentence that does not comport with § 3553(a).


IV.     The Minimally-Sufficient Sentence
        The parsimony provision of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) imposes a statutory cap on sentences,
regardless of what is recommended under the sentencing guidelines. The sentence cannot be greater
than necessary to achieve the purposes of punishment. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1). Those purposes
including deterrence, punishment, respect for the law and rehabilitation. Mr. Williams requests the
Court to consider a sentence between 54 and 66 months incarceration. The proposed sentence well
achieves the goals of deterrence, incapacitation, and respect for the law, and also provides ample
time for Mr. Williams to take full advantage of the rehabilitative services at the BOP.
        In determining the minimally-sufficient sentence, the Court must basically ask whether a
more severe sentence would achieve greater justice, deterrence, incapacitation, or rehabilitation. The



        6
           Mr. Williams also received 2 criminal history points for being on probation for his 1995
2nd degree robbery; P2-1995-2960A. The Court should note that Mr. Williams was within two
months of completing this 8 ½ year probationary period and was on a no report status at the time
of this offense.

                                                  5
     Case 1:06-cr-00082-T-DLM           Document 19         Filed 05/03/2007       Page 7 of 7



advisory sentencing guidelines combine only two factors when calculating the suggested range: the
offense conduct and the defendant’s criminal record. The suggested sentence does not include any
consideration of Mr. Williams individually as required by § 3553(a)(1) (individual’s unique
background and characteristics). The Court must not apply the advisory guideline sentence in any
kind of general or presumptive manner. The facts and circumstances present here, taken as a whole,
warrant a sentence below the advisory range. The sentence imposed by the Court cannot pass the
reasonableness standard of review if it does not promote respect for the law or provide for a fair and
just punishment. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2). The advisory sentencing range recommended here does
not comport with the purposes of sentencing under § 3553(a) and the Court cannot apply the
guidelines in any kind of general or presumptive manner. As a whole, the facts and circumstances
present here warrant a sentence significantly below the advisory range.


V.     Conclusion
       For all of these reasons, Mr. Williams asks the Court to impose a sentence between 54 and
66 months in prison.
