                  IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO


UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

     Plaintiff
                                                   CRIM NO. 10-342-4(RAM)
            v.

DAVIEL SALINAS-ACEVEDO

     Defendant


                               OPINION AND ORDER

RAÚL M. ARIAS-MARXUACH, United States District Judge

     This   matter     comes    before   the   Court   on   Defendant   Daviel

Salinas-Acevedo’s (“Defendant” or “Salinas-Acevedo”) Motion for

Compassionate Release and Sentence Reduction to Time Serve [sic].

(“Motion    for   Compassionate     Release”)    (Dockets     No.   661).    The

pending motion is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE because Salinas-Acevedo

has not shown extraordinary and compelling circumstances meriting

compassionate release under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1).

     On September 21, 2010, Defendant was indicted on three counts

of a 38-count indictment. He was charged with: (1) Conspiracy to

Possess with Intent to Distribute a Controlled Substance, namely

five (5) kilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing a

detectable amount of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 846 and

841(a)(1)    (“Count    11”);    Attempt   to    Possess    with    Intent   to

Distribute a Controlled Substance, that is, the above-referenced

Criminal No.      10-0342-4                                                     Page 2


substance, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 846 and 841(a)(1) and 18

U.S.C. § 2 (“Count 12”); and Possession of a Firearm in Relation

to a Drug Trafficking Crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)

(“Count 14”). (Docket No. 3). A Superseding Indictment was issued

on September 30, 2010 but the charges against Defendant remained

unchanged. (Docket No. 6). At trial, the jury failed to reach a

unanimous verdict as to Count 12 and a mistrial was declared

regarding that count. (Docket Nos. 499 at 2; 501 at 2). On January

10, 2013, Defendant was found guilty of Count 11 and Count 14 and

was   sentenced    to   prison        terms   of   121   months      and   60   months,

respectively, to be served consecutively to each other. (Docket

Nos. 501; 555).

      On June 2, 2021, Defendant filed his Motion for Compassionate

Release.    (Docket     No.    661).     Salinas-Acevedo’s        motion    avers     he

contracted    COVID-19        while    incarcerated      at    FCI    Manchester      in

Manchester, Kentucky in late August or early September 2020. Id.

at 1. He alleges the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) provided him with

no medical treatment and his facility’s health unit “simply allowed

[him] to suffer in severe pain and agony for three weeks.” Id. He

states the BOP declared him “recovered” on September 25, 2020. Id.

The   BOP   documented    his    alleged      recovery,       after    which    he   was

transferred several times until entering his current facility, FCI

La Tuna in Anthony, Texas. Id. at 1-2. While he tested negative

for COVID-19 upon entering FCI La Tuna, he contends he still

Criminal No.     10-0342-4                                              Page 3


exhibits    long-term   symptoms     of    COVID-19       including   fatigue,

shortness of breath, headaches, muscle pain and occasional loss of

taste and smell, among others. Id. at 2. He claims the BOP’s lack

of adequate health safeguards prevents him from avoiding crowds of

inmates, social distancing or controlling the ventilation in his

personal space, making it impossible for him to self-care. Thus,

there are compelling reasons warranting his release. Id.

     The Government opposed the motion on June 23, 2021, positing

that Defendant’s request should be denied because he failed to

provide evidence of the alleged residual symptoms and he is still

a danger to the community. (Docket No. 663). On December 6, 2021,

Defendant filed a motion with the Court submitting his immunization

record reporting he was fully vaccinated for COVID-19. (Docket No.

671-1).

     Typically, a court cannot modify an imprisonment term once

imposed. See 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c). But it may grant compassionate

release to a defendant subject to certain requirements. Id. §

3582(c)(1)(A). Prior to passage of the First Step Act in 2018,

compassionate release could only be granted upon motion by the

Director of BOP. See United States v. Saccocia, 10 F.4th 1, at *3

(1st Cir. 2021); see also United States v. Stone, 2021 WL 5146183,

*5 n.3 (D. Me. 2021). The First Step Act made it possible for

motions    by   defendants   if   they    first   apply    to   the   BOP.   See

Saccoccia, 10 F.4th at 4. Compassionate release on a defendant’s

motion requires the District Court find: (a) that “the defendant

has presented an ‘extraordinary and compelling reason’ warranting

a sentence reduction” and (b) that said reduction “is consistent

with   applicable    policy   statements    issued   by   the   Sentencing

Commission.” Id. (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A)). The District

Court must then consider any applicable section 3553(a) factors

and determine if the reduction “is warranted in whole or in part

under the particular circumstances of the case.” Id. (quoting

Dillon v. United States, 560 U.S. 817, 827 (2010)).

       The United States Sentencing Commission’s policy statement

1.B.13 concerning compassionate release predates the availability

of compassionate release upon a defendant’s motion. Id. at 7. Most

United States Courts of Appeals have concluded it is not an

“applicable” statement confining the courts. Id. at 8 (collecting

cases). The First Circuit has not resolved the issue. Id. Yet,

district courts within the First Circuit have found it helpful to

refer to statement 1.B.13 even if it might not be “conclusive.”

See Stone, 2021 WL 5146183, at *5 n.3; United States v. Brake,

2021 WL 4555180, at *1 (D. Me. 2021). Per First Circuit precedent,

extraordinary and compelling reasons are “(A) medical reasons; (B)

age; (C) family circumstances; and (D) ‘[o]ther [r]easons[.]’”

Saccoccia, 10 F.4th at 7 (quoting U.S.S.G § 1B1.13). Even so, the

First Circuit assumed for argument’s sake in Saccoccia “that a

court adjudicating a prisoner-initiated motion for compassionate
      Case 3:10-cr-00342-RAM Document 679 Filed 12/15/21 Page 5 of 9
Criminal No.    10-0342-4                                                 Page 5


release may go beyond the confines of the Sentencing Commission's

current policy guidance … in determining whether a particular

circumstance or set of circumstances constitutes an extraordinary

and compelling reason to grant the motion.” Id. at 8. Thus, the

Court reviews the entire record to find whether Defendant has shown

extraordinary and compelling reasons for a sentence reduction. See

Brake, 2021 WL 4555180, at *1; United States v. Ortiz-Aponte, 2021

WL 1030968, at *3 n.7 (D.P.R. 2021).

     Here, as the Government noted in its opposition, Salinas-

Acevedo has not provided any medical records whatsoever evincing:

(1) that he contracted COVID-19, (2) how the BOP addressed (or

failed to address) his diagnosis and (3) the alleged lack of public

health safeguards. (Docket No. 663 at 3). Hence, his request solely

relies on COVID-19’s existence to seek compassionate release. Id.

at 9. This does not suffice.

     “[T]the    mere    existence    of   COVID    19    in    society   and   the

possibility that it may spread to a particular prison alone cannot

independently      justify     compassionate            release,     especially

considering     BOP's    statutory    role,       and    its     extensive     and

professional efforts to curtail the virus's spread.” United States

v. De Jesus Negron, 498 F. Supp. 3d 275, 277 (D.P.R. 2020) (quoting

United States v. Raia, 954 F.3d 594, 597 (3d Cir. 2020)). First,

Defendant supposedly already contracted COVID-19. (Docket No. 661

at 1). Second, per his own admission, Defendant is fully vaccinated
      Case 3:10-cr-00342-RAM Document 679 Filed 12/15/21 Page 6 of 9
Criminal No.      10-0342-4                                              Page 6


against COVID-19, having received the first dose of the Moderna

vaccine on June 4, 2021 and the second dose on July 1, 2021.

(Docket No. 671-1).

      District courts within the First Circuit have explained that

“the Moderna vaccine is         proven     to   be    ‘94.1%   effective    at

preventing laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 illness in people who

received    two   doses   who   had   no   evidence    of   being   previously

infected.’” United States v. Beauregard, 2021 WL 2080019, at *8

(D.   Me.   2021)     (quotation      omitted).      Salinas-Acevedo’s     full

vaccination status therefore undermines the contention that his

health conditions amount to extraordinary circumstances meriting

compassionate release. Likewise, courts have typically denied a

motion for compassionate release when a defendant has received the

COVID-19 vaccine. See United States v. Osorio, 2021 WL 3079865, at

*2 (D. Mass. 2021) (citation omitted); see also Stone, 2021 WL

5146183, at *7 (collecting cases).

      Moreover, Defendant has failed to show he is at a greater

risk of reinfection, or if reinfected, he is at risk of a more

severe illness from COVID-19. Multiple district courts have found

that a risk of reinfection, standing alone, is insufficient to

grant a request for compassionate release. Defendant has not

evinced why the Court should rule differently in the case at bar.

See United States v. Derden, 2021 WL 3721848, at *2 (D. Minn. 2021)

(noting that the Moderna vaccine is not 100% percent effective,
       Case 3:10-cr-00342-RAM Document 679 Filed 12/15/21 Page 7 of 9
Criminal No.    10-0342-4                                             Page 7


thus there is a small chance that defendant might get reinfected,

but still finding that “[t]he risk that [defendant] will (1) be

reinfected with COVID-19 or a variant and (2) become seriously ill

is … too speculative to justify his release.”); United States v.

Jose Fernando Lopez-Quevedo, 2021 WL 5303111, at *2 (S.D. Cal.

2021)(denying compassionate release because defendant had gotten

COVID-19, failed to proffer medical records reporting his alleged

continuing symptoms or on their severity, been fully vaccinated

with the Pfizer vaccine and did not claim to have any health

condition increasing his risk of complication if he were to be

reinfected); Cf. United States v. Sandoval, 2021 WL 673566, at *5

(W.D. Wash. 2021) (granting compassionate release to a defendant

who had contracted COVID-19 and been vaccinated with a first dose

of the Moderna vaccine because he provided expert testimony showing

he was at an increased risk of reinfection due to immunosuppressant

drugs he was on after a kidney transplant).

      Similarly, there are no active cases of COVID-19 among inmates

at FCI La Tuna, where Defendant is being held. 1 Thus, it appears

the spread of COVID-19 among inmates is under control. See United

States v. Alexis, 2021 WL 2333041, at *2 (D. Colo. 2021) (denying

request for compassionate release because defendant’s facility,

FCI La Tuna, had zero COVID-19 cases among inmates and noting that

There are however 8 active cases among the facility’s staff.

“[t]he weight of authority thus far underscores the conclusion

that extraordinary and compelling circumstances generally do not

exist where there are no confirmed cases of the virus at the

prisoner's facility.”) (citations omitted).

     The Court is also not convinced Defendant is not a danger to

the community given his drug and firearm convictions and the fact

that he has over a year and a half (about 20 months) left in his

121-month sentence. See De Jesus-Negron, 498 F. Supp. 3d at 277

(denying a compassionate release request because defendant had not

provided any medical records showing he had a pre-existing medical

condition making him more susceptible to COVID-19, had about three

years left of his sentence and had not shown he was not a danger

to society given his drug and firearm convictions); United States

v. Sanders, 2020 WL 6460224, at *7 (M.D. Tenn. 2020) (denying a

release motion because defendant had not shown he would not be a

danger if released given that his “underlying offense—possession

of a firearm during a drug trafficking crime—involves the very

dangerous mix of drugs and firearms.”)

     Moreover, Defendant’s Count 11 charge carries a mandatory

minimum 10-year sentence, whereas the Count 14 charge carries a

mandatory minimum 5-year sentence, totaling a minimum of 15 years.

(Docket Nos. 526 at 21; 590 at 6). He is scheduled for release on

August 14, 2023. (Docket No. 647-1 at 3, 5). Releasing him now

would amount to a reduction of over a year and a half, which would

reduce his sentence to below the mandatory minimum and cause a

sentence disparity. See e.g., United States v. Johnson, 2020 WL

7774913, at *4 (W.D. La. 2020) (“A reduced sentence would also

cause disparity from sentences other defendants have received for

similar criminal conduct, as [defendant] was sentenced to the

statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months.”); United

States v. Sanders, 2020 WL 6460224, at *8–9 (M.D. Tenn. 2020)

(noting that while defendant had served a significant part of his

sentence, this did not change the fact that the modified sentence

he was asking for “would be disparately low compared to others

convicted of the same crime, with its ten-year mandatory minimum

sentence.”) Thus, a sentence reduction at this time would not

properly reflect the seriousness of his offense, promote respect

for the law, or provide adequate deterrence to criminal conduct as

required under 18 U.S.C. § 3553.

     Given that extraordinary and compelling circumstances are

lacking,    Defendant      Daviel    Salinas-Acevedo’s      Motion     for

Compassionate Release and Sentence Reduction to Time Serve [sic].

(Docket No. 661) is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

     In San Juan, Puerto Rico, this 15th day of December 2021.
