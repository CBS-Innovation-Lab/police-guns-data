                   IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

              v.                     :     CR No. 07-128S
                                     :

           GOVERNMENT=S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S
           MOTION FOR A SENTENCE OUTSIDE THE GUIDELINE RANGE

        The defendant seeks a variance from the sentencing range under

the     Guidelines,     alleging,    in   part,   that    the     history       and

characteristics of the defendant “militate in favor of a sentence

below the guideline range.”         Specifically, the defendant points to

his limited prior contacts with the criminal justice system, and to

letters which he claims demonstrate that “he has been a productive

member of society in the past and can again become a productive

member of society.”         The defendant also claims that his limited

criminal history demonstrates that there is little likelihood of

recidivism, and thus a variance is warranted on this ground as

well.

        While it is true that the defendant has had limited contact

with the criminal justice system, the characterization of the

defendant as having been a productive member of society                         and

unlikely to commit future crimes paints an overly rosy picture.                  It

ignores the very conduct which led to his appearance before this

court -- his involvement in gang activity.          The Pre-Sentence report

states that the defendant, by his own admission, has been involved
    Case 1:07-cr-00128-S-LDA    Document 30       Filed 01/17/2008    Page 2 of 3



with   the    Laos   Pride   street   gang      since   he   was     17,   and   only

terminated that involvement upon his incarceration in connection

with this case.      PSR ¶44.    These statements are corroborated by the

tattoo   on    his   back    consisting    of    the    letters      “LPJ”,   “which

signifies his affiliation with the Laos Pride gang.”                  PSR ¶39.      It

is also worth noting that the defendant has a tattoo of two pistols

on the right side of his chest.           Id.    Indeed, the defendant in the

past has flaunted his gang membership, posting pictures on “My

Space” which demonstrate such membership and promote such causes as

“Free Bobby”, a reference to Laos Pride member Bobby Soundara,

convicted in this very Court of pipe-bombing a home and costing an

elderly woman her eye. Exhibit A.1              Given all this, it can hardly

be said, as one of the letters submitted with his motion states,

that the defendant could be a good “role model to young adults.”

Absent a complete rejection of gang life, of which there is no

evidence to date, the defendant is a terrible role model for young

people, and he is likely to revert to his involvement in gang

activity upon his release.

       For these reasons, and because of the extremely serious nature

of the crime of which the defendant now stands convicted, the

 The pipe-bombing occurred on September 11, 2005. On November 17,
2005, the defendant was interviewed by ATF Special Agent Michael
Payne. During that interview, the defendant denied any involvement
in the pipe-bombing. He later told Special Agent Payne that he was
drunk on the night in question, that he was in “the car”, but did
not know what was going on. Exhibit B. He was never charged.
