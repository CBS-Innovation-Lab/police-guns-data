                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 08-cr-142-PB

Kyle Kimball



                                  O R D E R

     Defendant, Kyle Kimball, through counsel, has moved to

continue the trial scheduled for April 7, 2009, citing the need

for additional time to complete discovery and engage in plea

negotiations.      The government does not object to a continuance of

the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reasons and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from April 7, 2009 to May 5, 2009.             In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
