                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 12-cr-52-PB

Ian Fitzmorris



                                  O R D E R


     The defendant has moved to continue the February 5, 2013

trial in the above case for a period of 30 days, citing the need

for additional time to finalize plans for defendantâ€™s

participation in the pretrial diversion program.            The government

does not object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reason and in order to allow the

parties additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court

agrees to continue the trial from February 5, 2013 to March 5,

2013.     In agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds

pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ' 3161(h)(7)(A) that for the above-stated

reasons, the ends of justice served in granting a continuance

outweigh the best interests of the public and the defendant in a

speedy trial.
