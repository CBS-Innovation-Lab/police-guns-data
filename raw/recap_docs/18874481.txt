                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                       DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

             v.                               Case No. 07-cr-115-01-SM

Daniel Carl Hicks

                                     ORDER

      Defendant Hicks’ motion to continue the final pretrial conference and trial

is granted (document 20). Trial has been rescheduled for the September 2008

trial period. Defendant Hicks shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights not later

than August 25, 2008.      On the filing of such waiver, his continuance shall be

effective.

      The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18

U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would

unreasonably deny defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances.

      Change of Plea Hearing: August 15, 2008 at 2:30 p.m.

      Final Pretrial Conference, if necessary: August 29, 2008 at 4:00 p.m.

      Jury Selection, if necessary: September 3, 2008 at 9:30 a.m.
