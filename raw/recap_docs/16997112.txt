                        ORDER AFFIRMING THE
             RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE


       The United States Magistrate Judge filed with the Court on February 13, 2006, his

Recommended Decision (Docket No. 59). Defendant filed his Objection to the Recommended

Decision (Docket No. 60) on March 3, 2006. The Government filed its Response to Objection

(Docket No. 65) on March 20, 2006.

       I have reviewed and considered the Magistrate Judge's Recommended Decision, together

with the entire record; I have made a de novo determination of all matters adjudicated by the

Magistrate Judge's Recommended Decision; and I concur with the recommendations of the United

States Magistrate Judge for the reasons set forth in his Recommended Decision, and determine that

no further proceeding is necessary.

       1.      It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended
               Decision of the Magistrate Judge is hereby AFFIRMED.

       2.      Defendantsâ€™ Motion to Dismiss (Docket Nos. 31) is GRANTED
               WITHOUT PREJUDICE.
