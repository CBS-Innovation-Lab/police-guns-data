                        MEMORANDUM AND ORDER

                           February 26, 2009

Saris, U.S.D.J.

                            I. INTRODUCTION

     Defendant Aaron Eric Bailey has moved to suppress a gun and

ammunition seized during a warrantless search of a vehicle rented

by his sister on the ground that the search was not incident to

his arrest.   Among other things, the government argues that the

defendant does not have standing to challenge the search because

he abandoned the car and because he was an unauthorized driver as

well as an unlicensed one.     A hearing was held on February 6,

2009; two Boston Police Officers, Vance C. Mills and Scott Roby,

testified for the government.     The motion to suppress is DENIED.

                            II. BACKGROUND

     On January 29, 2008, Boston Police Officers Mel Steele and

Vance Mills were patrolling the Dorchester area of Boston in an

unmarked cruiser.   The officers observed a black Toyota
         Case 1:08-cr-10031-PBS Document 30 Filed 02/26/09 Page 2 of 7



Highlander SUV traveling at an excessive rate of speed (50 mph in

a 20-30 mph zone) and followed it.          The police also saw the

vehicle commit a lane violation.          Although the vehicle’s rear

windows were tinted, when the vehicle made a U-turn, the police

observed that the driver was the only person in the car.

Attempting to initiate a traffic stop, the officers activated the

cruiser’s emergency lights.        The SUV came to a stop.

     Officer Mills exited the cruiser.          Before Mills could begin

to approach the vehicle, the SUV sped away at a high rate of

speed.    A high-speed chase ensued.        The officers pursued the SUV

for several blocks, including a brief jaunt up a one-way street

the wrong way, until the defendant suddenly slammed on the brakes

and jumped out of the driver’s side of the SUV while the vehicle

was still in motion.       The officers pursued Bailey on foot.

Bailey fled through a number of residential backyards, at which

point the officers lost sight of him.          Additional police

officers, as well as a K-9 unit, responded to the scene to assist

in the search for Bailey.        Officers eventually located Bailey

hiding in the backyard of a house.          He told Mills that another

person in the car told him to run because he had marijuana and a

scale.    No second person was found.        Mills and the defendant knew

each other from numerous prior encounters; for instance, on

January 5, 2008, Mills had made a motor vehicle stop of the

defendant, who did not have a valid license.

     After Bailey jumped out of the SUV, the vehicle rolled up

                                      2

onto the curb and came to rest on the sidewalk against a fence at

125 Whitfield Street, with the rear of the vehicle protruding

into the street.   The SUV was still in drive, with the engine

still running, the key in the ignition, the lights on, and the

driver’s-side door open.    Officer Roby went into the glove

compartment to get the registration.      Having observed a metal

object partially hidden behind the glove compartment, he reached

back and was “shocked” to feel a gun trigger.        Officers later

recovered the gun, which was loaded.      A marijuana blunt was also

found on the driver’s side of the vehicle.

     The SUV was rented on January 11, 2008 by Lisa Bailey,

defendant’s sister, from Enterprise Car Rental Company.          She said

she gave the vehicle to defendant’s friend Sean.         According to

the rental agreement, the defendant was not authorized to drive

the SUV.   Additionally, as mentioned earlier, the defendant did

not have a valid driver’s license.

                           III. DISCUSSION

     The government argues that Bailey lacked a reasonable

expectation of privacy in the SUV because he abandoned the

vehicle.   In order to challenge a search or seizure, a defendant

must have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the area

searched or the item seized.     See Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S.

128, 143 (1978).   “It is well settled that if a defendant

abandons property while he is being pursued by police officers,



                                   3
         Case 1:08-cr-10031-PBS Document 30 Filed 02/26/09 Page 4 of 7



he forfeits any reasonable expectation of privacy he may have had

in that property.”      United States v. Soto-Beniquez, 356 F.3d 1,

36 (1st Cir. 2004)(citing Abel v. United States, 362 U.S. 217,

241 (1960)).     “To demonstrate abandonment, the government must

establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant’s

voluntary words or conduct would lead a reasonable person in the

searching officer’s position to believe that the defendant

relinquished his property interests in the item searched or

seized.”    United States v. Basinski, 226 F.3d 829, 836 (7th Cir.

2000).    Courts “look at the totality of the circumstances, but

pay particular attention to explicit denials of ownership and to

any physical relinquishment of property.”          Id. at 837.     “There is

also a subjective component . . . in the sense that a defendant

who is trying to show that he did not abandon property must also

demonstrate that he actually expected the item to remain

private.”     Id. at 837 n.2.

     In circumstances similar to these, courts have held that a

defendant who flees on foot after a vehicular chase has abandoned

the vehicle.     See e.g., United States v. Edwards, 441 F.2d 749,

750-51 (5th Cir. 1971) (finding abandonment where defendant ran

his car off the road while being pursued by police, jumped from

the car, leaving the engine running and the lights on, and

continued to flee on foot); United States v. Lynch, 290 F. Supp.

2d 490, 494-97 (M.D. Pa. 2003) (stating, in dicta, that

“abandonment would be sufficient reason” for the court to deny

                                      4

defendant’s motion to suppress where he fled from his vehicle,

“leaving the driver’s door open and the motor running”, after

ramming police cruiser).

     In this case, with the police in pursuit, Bailey jumped from

a moving SUV and fled, leaving the SUV to lurch onto a sidewalk,

with the door still open, the engine still running, and the keys

in the ignition.   By doing so, he abandoned the SUV and forfeited

any reasonable expectation of privacy in the SUV.

     The government also argues that Bailey lacked a reasonable

expectation of privacy in the SUV because he was neither a

licensed driver nor an authorized user of the SUV.         Courts are

split on whether a defendant can have a reasonable expectation of

privacy in a rental vehicle which he is not authorized to drive.

See United States v. Thomas, 447 F.3d 1191, 1196-97 (9th Cir.

2006) (describing the “three approaches” courts have taken to

“determin[e] when an unauthorized driver of a rental vehicle has

standing to challenge a search.”); United States v. Crisp, 542 F.

Supp. 2d 1267, 1277-79 (M.D. Fla. 2008) (summarizing decisions

and stating, in dicta, that “the weight of authority” supports

the conclusion that an unauthorized driver “does not have a

legally cognizable expectation of privacy” in the vehicle);

compare United States v. Wellons, 32 F.3d 117, 119 (4th Cir.

1994) (applying a bright-line rule that a person who is not

authorized to drive in the rental agreement cannot have a

reasonable expectation of privacy), with United States v. Best,

                                   5
      Case 1:08-cr-10031-PBS Document 30 Filed 02/26/09 Page 6 of 7



135 F.3d 1223, 1225 (8th Cir. 1998) (holding that an unauthorized

driver generally does not have standing unless he can demonstrate

that he had the permission of the authorized driver), and Thomas,

447 F.3d at 1199 (adopting the Eighth Circuit’s approach that an

unauthorized driver may have standing if he has received

permission to use the car), with United States v. Smith, 263 F.3d

571, 586 (6th Cir. 2001) (stating that “as a general rule,” an

unauthorized driver will not have a reasonable expectation of

privacy but eschewing a “bright line test” and adopting a

totality of the circumstances, case-by-case approach).

     Notably, however, the defendant in this case was not only an

unauthorized driver, but also an unlicensed one.         At least two

courts have convincingly reasoned that any expectation of privacy

by such a defendant is not reasonable because the defendant

“should not have been driving any car, much less a rental car

that [the rental company] never would have given him permission

to drive.”   United States v. Haywood, 324 F.3d 514, 516 (7th Cir.

2003) (holding that the unauthorized and unlicensed defendant

driver lacked standing to challenge the search of the vehicle);

Crisp, 542 F. Supp. 2d at 1281 (concluding that because the

defendant was unauthorized and unlicensed, “society is not

prepared to recognize Defendant’s expectation of privacy as

reasonable” and denying defendant’s motion to suppress).

     As an unauthorized and unlicensed driver, Bailey cannot

reasonably have expected privacy from governmental intrusion

while driving the SUV.    Under the totality of these circumstances

– abandonment, lack of authorization, and lack of a driver’s

license – any expectation of privacy was unreasonable.

                            IV. CONCLUSION

     Defendant’s motion to suppress (Docket No. 25) is DENIED.
