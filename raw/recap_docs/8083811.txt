           GOVERNMENT'S MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF ITS
          OBJECTION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO MODIFY SENTENCE

I.    INTRODUCTION

      The defendant has moved to modify his original sentence

pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) and USSG Amendment 709.                    For

all of the following reasons, the defendant’s motion should be

denied.

II.   PROCEDURAL HISTORY

      On February 13, 2008, the defendant pled guilty to a single

count indictment charging him with being a felon-in-possession of

a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).               The defendant

had a base offense level of 24 (USSG § 2K2.1(a)(2)) and was

credited with a three level decrease for acceptance of

responsibility.      As part of his plea agreement the government

agreed not to seek an enhancement pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)

(armed career criminal).       The defendant’s total offense level was

21 and he had a criminal history category of VI based on 18

criminal history points.       On May 21, 2004, the defendant was

sentenced to a term of seventy-seven (77) months imprisonment.

By his motion, the defendant seeks a recalculation of his

                                       3

criminal history category based on a November 2007 amendment to

the Sentencing Guidelines.      Because the amendment was not made

retroactive, the defendant’s motion should be denied.

III. ARGUMENT

     The defendant has moved to modify his sentence based upon

Amendment 709 of the sentencing guidelines.         The defendant’s view

is that his sentence should be recalculated because the new rules

would result in a lower criminal history category and presumably

a lower sentence.    Even if true, Amendment 709 has not been made

retroactive and the defendant is not entitled to any relief.

          A.     Amendment 709 Is Not Retroactive and the Defendant
                 Is Not Entitled to Any Relief

     On November 1, 2007 long after the defendant’s judgment

became final, the U.S. Sentencing Commission adopted Amendment

709 which changed the way some offenses are calculated when

determining a defendant’s criminal history category.             See USSG.,

Supp. To App. C., Amendment 709 (2007).        Amendment 709 was not,

however, made retroactive.      United States v. Godin, 522 F.3d 133,

135 (1st Cir. 2008) citing United States Sentencing Commission,

Supplement to the 2007 Guideline Manual, § 1B1.10(c) (March 3,

2008) (not listing Amendment 709).1       Amendments which are not


     1
       Godin dealt with Amendment 709, which was then pending,
and remanded for resentencing because even though the amendment
was not made retroactive, the there pending appeal had not yet
resulted in a final disposition. Mr. Taylor’s case presents no
such window of opportunity.

listed in USSG § 1B1.10(c) are not to be applied retroactively.

Absent a retroactive application there is simply no basis for a

resentencing.      See United States v. Baker, 2008 WL 1927149 (E.D.

Ark); U.S. v. Ashley, 2008 WL 681053 (M.D. Fla.)

(discussing application of 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) and USSG §

1B1.10(a)(1)).

IV.   CONCLUSION

      For the foregoing reasons the defendant’s motion should be

denied.
