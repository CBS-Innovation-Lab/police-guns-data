	                 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                        DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

             v.                           Criminal No. 11-cr-163-01-JL

Sheena Levesque

                                  O R D E R


        The assented to motion to reschedule jury trial (document no.

14) filed by defendant is granted; Final Pretrial is rescheduled to

April 30, 2012 at 9:30 a.m.; Trial is continued to the two-week period

beginning May 1, 2012, 9:30 a.m.         The court appreciates counsel's

conscientious inclusion of a STA calculation in the motion.

        The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a

continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ' 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv), for the

reasons set forth in the motion.




        SO ORDERED.

                                          ___________________________
