 Plaintiff
 vs                                                CRIMINAL 11-0472CCC
 LUIS ALBERTO REYES-RIVERA
 Defendant


                                         ORDER

       Having considered the Report and Recommendation filed on April 25, 2012 (docket
entry 34) on a Rule 11 proceeding of defendant Luis Alberto Reyes-Rivera held before
U.S. Magistrate Judge Camille L. Vélez-Rivé on April 18, 2012, to which no opposition has
been filed, the same is APPROVED. The Court FINDS that his plea was voluntary and
intelligently entered with awareness of his rights and the consequences of pleading guilty
and contains all elements of the offense charged in the indictment. The Court, however, will
defer its decision on accepting defendant’s plea agreement until it has reviewed the
Presentence Report.
       This case was referred to the U.S. Probation Office for preparation of a Presentence
Investigation Report since April 18, 2012. The sentencing hearing is set for July 17, 2012
at 4:15 PM.
       SO ORDERED.
       At San Juan, Puerto Rico, on May 23, 2012.
