                             May 24, 2013

Saris, C.J.

     In a letter to the Clerk dated April 20, 2013 (#66),

defendant/petitioner Claude Pelissier asks for copies of two

documents free of charge to add as exhibits to his motion under

28 U.S.C. § 2255 (“§ 2255”).     He asks for a transcript of the

detention hearing held on November 20, 2009 and a copy of his

arrest warrant.    Pelissier does not identify the argument(s) he

hopes to advance by including these documents as exhibits to his

§ 2255 motion (#55).    The transcript of the hearing has not been

prepared by a court reporter.

I.   TRANSCRIPT

     Under 28 U.S.C. § 753(f) (“§ 753(f)”), the United States

must pay “fees for transcripts furnished in criminal proceedings

brought under section 2255 of [Title 28] to persons permitted to

sue or appeal in forma pauperis . . . if the trial judge or

circuit judge certifies that the suit or appeal is not frivolous

and that the transcript is needed to decide the issue presented

by the suit or appeal.”    28 U.S.C. § 753(f).

     Here, the Court cannot certify at this time that the

transcript is needed to decide the issue presented by the § 2255

motion.   Based on a review of the § 2255 motion, it appears that

Pelissier is seeking a transcript of his detention hearing to

bolster his argument that he received ineffective assistance of

counsel when his counsel advised him to remain in federal custody

instead of seeking to return to state custody, where he would

have been eligible to earn good time credits.         As the government

has pointed out in its opposition (#67) to the § 2255 motion,

this subject was addressed by defense counsel during at

sentencing.   The transcript of the sentencing hearing has already

been prepared (#42) and is included in the government’s

opposition.   At this juncture, the Court cannot discern any basis

for expending taxpayer funds for the preparation of the detention

hearing transcript when it is very possible that what was said or

not said at the detention hearing may be irrelevant in light of

the Court’s decision at sentencing.       Accordingly, the request for

a transcript of the detention hearing is DENIED WITHOUT

PREJUDICE.
II.   ARREST WARRANT

      Pelissier’s indigent status does not qualify him for free

copies of documents, see, e.g., Anderson v. Gillis, 236 Fed.

Appx. 738, 739 (3d Cir. 2007) (“The in forma pauperis statute

does not grant the court the authority to provide an indigent

litigant with copies of all the documents in the record.”), and

it is unclear why Pelissier needs this document.          However, as a

one-time courtesy, the Clerk shall supply Pelissier with a copy
