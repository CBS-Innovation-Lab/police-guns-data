                                O R D E R


      The assented to motion to reschedule jury trial (document no.

26) filed by defendant is granted; Trial is continued to the two-

week period beginning December 7, 2010 at 9:30 a.m.

      Defendant shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights within 10

days.   The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting

a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv), for the

reasons set forth in the motion.

      SO ORDERED.
