                    UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                         DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America,
      Plaintiff

               v.
                                             Case No. 11-cr-79-01-SM

Angel Oller
     Defendant

                                     ORDER


      Defendant Oller’s motion to continue the final pretrial conference and trial

is granted (document no. 8). Trial has been rescheduled for the month of

October 2011. Defendant Oller shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights not later

than July 25, 2011. On the filing of such waiver, his continuance shall be

effective.

      The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial,

18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would

unreasonably deny the defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances.
