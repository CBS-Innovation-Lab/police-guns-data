                    UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                       DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

            v.                                Case No. 08-cr-80-01 SM

Michelle Despres



                                     ORDER

      Defendant's to motion to continue the trial (document no. 30) is granted. Trial

has been rescheduled for the May trial period. Defendant shall file a Waiver of

Speedy Trial Rights not later than March 13, 2010. On the filing of such waiver, the

continuance shall be effective. Absent extraordinary circumstances, no further

continuances will be granted.

      The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C.

ยง 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would unreasonably deny

the defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective preparation taking into

account the exercise of due diligence under the circumstances.
