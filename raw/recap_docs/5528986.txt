1:04 CR 10299-030 (PBS)
Hon. Judge Saris:

l write this letter in the hopes of obtaining, and securing, your
Honor's help in the following matter.

ln a sincere effort to properly serve-out my sentence in full compliance
with F.B.O.P. standards and regulations, and in an attempt to increase
my chances, and eligibility, in order to qualify for an early transfer
under the "Halfway House" and/or "Home Confinement" programs, l formally,
and respectfully, submit this petition for your Honor‘s judicial
recommendation to F.B.O.P. to consider, accept and approve, for service
of sentence, up to one (l) year, direct commitment to a C.C.C.-sponsored
"Halfway House" and/or "Home Confinement" program(s), pursuant to the
following case files:

l) Wedelstedt vs. Wiley, 06-1461 (lOth Cir., 2007)
2) Levine vs. Apker, 455 F.3d 71 (an Cir., 2006)
3) Fults vs. Sanders, 422 F.3d 1088 (Sth Cir., 2006)
4) Woodall vs. F.B.O.P., 432 F3d 235 (3rd Cir., 2005)
5) Elwood vs. Jeter, 386 F.3d 843 (Bth Cir., 2004)
6) Goldings vs. Winn, 383 F.3d 17 (lst Cir., 2004)

Although your Honor's recommendation must precede my application to

the F.B.O.P., l believe l can show, under whatever scrutiny, conditions
or pre-requisites, that I am a good, and dependable, candidate for
these programs so that l might, once again and for all, take my
appropriate place in society, alongside my family. These two programs
are considerably based on an inmate's record during incarceration.

That record is model, impeccable and stands unchallenged.

Thanking you, as always and in advance, for your valuable time, and
consideration, to this very urgent matter. 1 remain

Respectfully submitted,

_//Zi`l-~` J/(__\
