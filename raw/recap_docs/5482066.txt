The¢Accussed moves the court to Appoint Gounsel for further
proceedings before-the court (tribunal), whether for any
purpose that constitutionally may require the '§§sistance of
counsel', and consistent with the FIFTH article of the original _
Constitution For The United States {Sept.l7,1787), and the SIXTH
AMENDMENT of that Constitution, and the supporting cases thereto

the inmate (detainee) in relation to the ordinary incidents
of prison lifeu. But in HUDSON V.PALMER§&ES US 5i7,52&(1@84)_
the court held that "lawful imprisonment deprives [c]itizens

 

of the freedom and other rights", but here with the "accussed'l

 

is not ’actually convicted yet' as the court (trihunal) has

yet to 'formally accept' the accused change of plea to °guilty‘,
and thus the 'accussed' could for any reason whatsoever

revoke the prior action (plea agreement) and whether to proceed
with a °trial', and or otherwise as to any other action that

the 'accussed' may so elect, whether or not it is/was through
the assistance of counsel or not, see Fed.R.Crim“P.Rule ll(d)

e.g., US V.PATTERSON,ZQZ F3d.615,624(9th.€ir,2002), where the
court (tribunal) had chosen the THIRD OPTION, the court (tribunal)
had elected to ’defer its decision until after it has an

 

opportunity to reveiw a presentence report'.“THUS, this would

 

allow the 'accused°,relies upon the holding of the an, 7th,
and 9th.Circuits that the defendant may freely withdraw a plea
,without having to give any reason for the withdrawal, up intil
the court (tribunal).accepts the plea. However the 5th,_6th,

RESERVATION OF RIGHTS
ll. (Continued)

The qAccused' herein the CAPTIONED matter specifically and
expressly lReserves All Rights that are Unalienable'and
liWithout Prejudice and Under Necessity', consistent with the
Uniform Commercial Code Article 1, Section 207.; HALE V.HENKLE,

201 US a3,at 7a ("the individual may stand upon his constitutional rights
(protections) as a citizen. He is entitled to ca;;y on his¥private business
in his own Wgy. His¢power to Gontract is Unlimited, He owes no duty to the
State since he receives nothing therefrom,.beyond the protections of life
and Propertyo His rights are such as existed Ey the Law of the iand, long
antecedent to'the*organization of the State, and can only be taken from him
by due process of the law and in accordance to the Constitution. He owes
nothing to the public as long as he does not trespass upon their rights".;
and see "ln the United States the people are the sovereign and all the
government cnanot sever its relationship to the people by taking away their
citizenship.."--AFROYIM V.RUSK,387 US 253(1967); "People of a State are
entitled to all rights`iprotections) which formerly belonged to the King by
his prerogative.."--LANSING V,SMITH,& (Wend) 9,20{1829); "since common_
usage? the 'term' p§£son does not include the sovereign, statutes not
implying the phrase are ordinarily construed to exclude it.."--Title

1 USC § l)n.IZ~-US V.FOX,Q& US 315.; WlLSON V.OMAHA,442 US 653,667l1979)

no authority above a Sovereign to which an appeal can be made“, 4 Wheat 402.

 

 

l also take notice of the opinion by the Supreme Court (Atricle lll Court
Constitutional Court), as opposed to the legislative.lribunals (Article l
and Article ll court2j such as 'district courts' are tribtmals and not a
Constitutional Court (Article lll-only); of the case of §§ll£ V.MICHIGAN
SIHTE POLlCE,lOS l£d.Zd.d$(lQSQ) made it perfectly glear that l'§'§.the 1
sovereign, cannot be named in any statute merely a p§£son , or any person
". l am a memnber of the "Sovereignty" as defined in YICK WO VLHOPKINS,

113 US 356, and "while sovereign powers are delegated to the agencies of
government itself remains with the People, by whom, and for whom, all
government exists and acts"....-- and the DRED SCOTI casesBO US 393.

and see in US V.LEE,106 US 196,at ZOS.; BUT SUCH CASES AS CITED ARE NOT

TO BE CONSTRUED AS EXCLUSIVE, AND NOT MEANT TO EXCLUDE WHAT lS NOT CTTED,
