UNITED STATES OF AMERICA                            :
                                                    :
               v.                                   :        CR 07-128

VIXAY PHOMMARATH                                    :


 MOTION TO EXTEND TIME TO FILE A MOTION FOR A SENTENCE OUTSIDE
                     THE GUIDELINE RANGE

       Now comes the defendant in the above entitled matter and moves:

       1) That the time for filing a Motion for a Sentence Outside the Guideline Range

be extended to January 14, 2008.

       Counsel for the Defendant was on trial in the matter of the Commonwealth of

Massachusetts v. Keith Sampson, BRCR 2006-719 from January 7, 2008, through

January 10, 2008, and requests additional time because of that factor.




               CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO 18 U.S.C. section 3161(h)

       The defense does not believe 18 U.S.C. ยง3161(h) is implicated by the filing of

this motion.
