                          JOINT MOTION TO EXCLUDE TIME

        On September 11, 2007, the government filed a motion to

continue the then-scheduled trial date of September 24, 2007, on

the basis that AUSA Connolly was expecting the birth of a child

on or about September 27, 2007.        In said motion, the parties

jointly agreed to exclude the period of time from September 24,

2007, to the new trial date, which was later set for March 3,

2008.    Although the parties agreed to exclude the time, AUSA

Connolly neglected to file a separate motion for excludable

delay.

        On January 25, 2008, the defendant filed a motion for a pre-

plea Presentence Report, which the Court granted on February 8,

2008, effectively canceling the March 3, 2008, trial.

        The parties hereby jointly move this Court to formally

exclude the following periods from the time within which trial

must commence.

        9/24/07 - 3/3/08      previously agreed upon period contained
                              in assented-to motion to continue trial

        2/8/08 - 7/9/08       period from Courtâ€™s granting of motion
