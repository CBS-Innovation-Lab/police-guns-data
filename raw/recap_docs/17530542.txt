STATEMENT OF REASONS

Vll COURT DETERMINAT|ONS OF RESTITUTION
A m Restitution Not Applicable.
B Total Amount of Restitution:

C Restitution not ordered (Cheek only one.):

l |:| For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S C_ § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S C. § 3663A(c)(3)(A)

2 l:l For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under lB U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount ot` the victims` losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any viet.im would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under lS U S.C § 3663A(c)(3)(|3)
3 l:l For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S C. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
ordered because the complication and prolongation ol` the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning ofa restitution order outweigh

the need to provide restitution to any victims under lS U.S C. § 3663(3}(1)(B)(ii).

4 |:l Restitution is not ordered for other reasons (Explain.)

D l:l Partial restitution is ordered for these reasons (lS U.S.C. § 3553(e)):
