                            MEMORANDUM AND ORDER

WILLIAM E. SMITH, United States District Judge.

     Julio Candelario has filed a Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or

Correct Sentence by a Person in Federal Custody (the “Motion”) (ECF

No. 85) pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ' 2255.              For the reasons stated

below, the Motion is DENIED.

I.   Background

     On June 7, 2010, Candelario pleaded guilty to conspiracy to

commit Hobbs Act robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a) (Count

1); Hobbs Act robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1951(a) & 2

(Count   2);   use    and   possession   of   a    firearm   during   and   in

furtherance of a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§

924(c)(1)(A)(ii) & 2 (Count 3); conspiracy to possess with intent

to distribute marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846 (Count 4);

and possession with intent to distribute marijuana in violation of

21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(D) (Count 5).           Also on June 7, 2010,

Candelario pleaded guilty (in an unrelated matter) to being a felon

in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).

(CR. No. 09-155-S.)
Case 1:09-cr-00066-S-DLM Document 90 Filed 07/02/13 Page 2 of 4 PageID #: 377



        The Probation Officer determined that Candelario was a career

offender      and    his     Guidelines    range    was     262-327    months    of

incarceration.       (Presentence Report (“PSR”) & 42.)          The calculation

included a credit for acceptance of responsibility as well as the

seven     year     mandatory    consecutive      sentence    required    for    the

possession of a firearm during a crime of violence conviction.

Candelario was sentenced to 180 months imprisonment, which was

consistent with the government’s recommendation and below the

advisory Guidelines range.           Following sentencing on February 11,

2011, Candelario did not file a direct appeal.

II.   Discussion

        Candelario contends that “the Court improperly [enhanced his]

sentence to carreer [sic] offender using a prior conviction that

does not meet the requirement, [and thus] per Simmons v. U.S. [his]

conviction is invalid for enhancement purposes.”                      (Motion 5.)

Candelario’s argument appears meritless on its face; he does not

indicate why the conviction should not be counted, nor does he

provide a citation to the specific case to which he is referring.

        In   any    event,   the   Court   may     only   address     Candelario’s

contention if his Motion is timely and because the Motion is

untimely, and he does not otherwise argue why it should not be

considered untimely, the Court need not address the merits of his

claim.

        28 U.S.C. ' 2255 provides in pertinent part:

        A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court
        established by Act of Congress claiming the right to be
        released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in
Case 1:09-cr-00066-S-DLM Document 90 Filed 07/02/13 Page 3 of 4 PageID #: 378



     violation of the Constitution or laws of the United
     States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to
     impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess
     of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject
     to collateral attack, may move the court which imposed
     the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the
     sentence.

 28 U.S.C. ' 2255(a).     Additionally:

     (f) A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a
     motion under this section. The limitation period shall
     run from the latest of—

           (1)   the date on which the judgment of conviction
           becomes final;

           (2)   the date on which the impediment to making a
           motion created by governmental action in violation of
           the Constitution or laws of the United States is
           removed, if the movant was prevented from making a
           motion by such governmental action;

           (3)   the date on which the right asserted was
           initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that
           right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court
           and made retroactively applicable to cases on
           collateral review; or

           (4)   the date on which the facts supporting the
           claim or claims presented could have been discovered
           through the exercise of due diligence.

28 U.S.C. ' 2255(f).

     Candelario’s judgment was entered on February 15, 2011.            (ECF

No. 82.)    He had fourteen days from the date judgment was entered

to file a direct appeal pursuant to Rule 4(1)(A)(i) of the Federal

Rules of Appellate Procedure.         Candelario never filed a direct

appeal.     When a prisoner does not file a direct appeal, his

conviction becomes final when the time for filing a notice of

appeal expires.    See Sanchez-Castellano v. United States, 358 F.3d

424, 428 (6th Cir. 2004); Wims v. United States, 225 F.3d 186, 188
Case 1:09-cr-00066-S-DLM Document 90 Filed 07/02/13 Page 4 of 4 PageID #: 379



(2d Cir. 2000).      The conviction became final on March 1, 2011.

Therefore, Candelario had one year from March 1, 2011 to file a

motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.         Candelario’s Motion was not

filed until over one year and four months later, on July 19, 2012,

and thus his claim is time barred.        See 28 U.S.C. ' 2255(f)(1).

III. Conclusion

     Since Candelario’s Motion is not timely, and he does not

otherwise argue why his untimeliness should be excused under 28

U.S.C. ' 2255(f), the instant Motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ' 2255

is hereby DENIED and DISMISSED.



               RULING ON CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY

     Pursuant to Rule 11(a) of the Rules Governing Section 2255

Proceedings in the United States District Courts, this Court hereby

finds that this case is not appropriate for the issuance of a

certificate of appealability (“COA”) because Candelario has failed

to make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional

right as to any claim, as required by 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).

     Candelario is advised that any motion to reconsider this

ruling will not extend the time to file a notice of appeal in this

matter.   See Rule 11(a), Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings.


IT IS SO ORDERED:
