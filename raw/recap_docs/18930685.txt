                    UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                      Case No. 06-cr-105-PB

Vincent Chaney

                               O R D E R

     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

trial scheduled for February 2, 2010, citing the need for

additional time to complete the plea negotiation process or

prepare for trial.   The government does not object to a

continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reason and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from February 2, 2010 to March 2, 2010.            In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(7) that for the above-stated reasons, the ends

of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the best

interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
