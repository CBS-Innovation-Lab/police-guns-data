                             DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

                v.                                    Criminal No. 10-cr-160-01-JD

                                            ORDER


       The assented to motion to reschedule jury trial (document no. 14) filed by the defendant is

granted. The continuance is limited to 120 days, without prejudice to seek a further continuance if

necessary. Trial is continued to the two-week period beginning August 16, 2011, 9:30 AM.

       Defendant shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights within 10 days. The court finds that the

ends of justice served by granting a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv), for the reasons set forth in the motion.

       SO ORDERED.



                                                      /s/ Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr.
