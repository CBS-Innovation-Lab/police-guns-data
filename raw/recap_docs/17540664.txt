        C     Restitulion not ordered (Check only one.):

                     o	   For otl('nses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 USC ~ 36631\, restitution is not ardered because the number of
                          Identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 lJS.C   ~   3663A(c)(3)(A)

              2	     0    For c,tlenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 USC ~ 3663A, restitution is not,xdered because determining complex
                          Issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims' losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
                          that the n~ed to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 US C ~ 3663A( c)( 3)( B)

                     o	   For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 LJ.SC ~ 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restllution IS not
                          ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh
                          the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18LJ.SC ~ 3663(a)(1 )(B)(ii).
