                     UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                        DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

              v.                               Case No. 10-cr-19-01 PB

Luis Rios



                                      ORDER

         The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the trial scheduled for

May 4, 2010, citing the need for additional time to finalize plea negotiations. The

government does not object to a continuance of the trial date.

         Accordingly, for the above reason and to allow the parties additional time to

properly prepare for trial, the court will continue the trial from May 4, 2010 to June

1, 2010. In agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18 U.S.C. ยง

3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the ends of justice served in granting

the continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy

trial.
