Re: Case No. 3:05-CR-30003-MAP-2

Dear Judge Ponsor:

I was sentenced on April 28, 2006 to seventy-two (72) months
incarceration and four (A) years Supervised Release for Poss-
ession With Intent to Distribute Cocaine (2 cts.); Aiding and
Abetting (2 cts.); Conspiracy With Intent to Distribute and to
Distribute Cocaine Base (2 cts.); Distributtion and Possession
With Intent to Distribute Marijuana (2 cts.); Aiding and Abetting
(2 cts.); Conspiracy to Possess With lntent to Distribute
Marijuana (2 cts.). The relevant conduct considered by this
Honorable Court amounted to seven (7) grams of cocaine and
fourteen (14) grams of marijuana.

l am sure that you are aware that Congress and the United
States Sentencing Commission has decided to restructure the
sentencing guidelines (2Dl.l) as it relates to prisoners sen~
tenced for crack violations. The Commission has made this de-
cision in order to bring parity between those sentenced for
powder cocaine and crack cocaine violations.

Because Congress took no action on the United States
Sentencing Commission's proposed amendment to the sentencing
guidelines (to reduce base offense levels for crimes involving
crack cocaine by two levels) the change in the guideline is
now effective. Retroactivity applies as of March 3, 2008.

The Probation Officer's recommendation resulted in me being
liable for a sentencing guideline range of 26. The most
pressing issue before me is how these new developments will
affect me?

Your Honor, while l do understand the seriousness of the
offense and make no excuse for my behavior, l would like

to take this opportunity to again express my contrition and
deep sense of remorse. l do not in any way seek to minimize
the role that l played in coming here. l understand clearly
that for accountability purposes that it is necessary for

me to do i“some" time. After all, one does reap what one sows.

l only ask that this Court consider that I have followed
it's order of 05/01/06 nearly to the letter. l have completed
a forty (40) hour Intensive Drug Education Program. l am
enrolled in the General Equivalency Diploma (G.E.D.) program
and l have consistently received favorable Progress Reports.

l am also enrolled in extra curricular courses (Math and Algebra).
l have remained disciplinary infraction free and continue to
work on a daily basis.

While incarceration is not easy, nor was it meant to be,
l continue to make the transition with a minimal amount of
difficulty. l am taking a proactive approach towards recovery
and rehabilitation. l am taking advantage of every program
afforded me which will help me to improve spiritually, socially,
educationally, and physically.

Finally Your Honor, l have an extensive family and community
support network. This was evidenced by the letters of support
submitted at sentencing as well as the support in the court
room during other proceedings. l do have a viable release/
supervision plan which includes; employment; community service;
caring for my family; continuing my education and attending
worship services.

Attached you will find copies of my Progress Report,
Educational Transcript, Certificates and Programming Profile.
Also attached are letters of support from family and community
members regarding this issue. Please conside this letter
as a Title 18 USC Motion Requesting a Sentence Correction as
per the United States Sentencing Commission's Retroactive
Application of the Crack Cocaine Amendment. Thank you for
your time and consideration in this matter. l look forward
to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

Stanley L. Mims

Re: Letter of Reference for Stanley L. Mims; Case No.
3:05-CR-30003-MAP-2

Dear Judge Ponsor:

l am writing this letter on behalf of Mr. Stanley L. Mims.
He was sentenced on April 28, 2006 to seventy-two months incar-
ceration and four uears Supervised Release fro a crack cocaine
charge.

While 1 do not seek to excuse his behavior, l do know
that Stanley was a very impressionable young man who made some

wrong choices. He is by no means a bad or violent person. As
a result of some of his wrong choices, he ended up in your
court. lt is my understanding that there have been some new

developments in the sentencing guidelines set forth by the
United States Sentencing Commission. These new changes seek
to bring parity between those sentenced for powder cocaine
violations and those sentenced for crack cocaine violations.

l have known Stanley for five years. l have been in
communication with him since the beginning of this ordeal
through both visits and correspondence. l believe that given
the opportunity he will be extremely successful and productive.
l would like to see him close this "chapter" of his life. He
has shared his goals and release plans with me. They include
employment; caring for his family; and continuing his education.
lt is for these reasons that l am proud to write a letter of

reference on his behalf. I have seen the change first hand
in this young man's life. Thank you for considering and
reading this letter.

Respectfully,

LaKeisha“Hart
