                              UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                            FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,                        Criminal Case No. 13-CR-016M
               v.
DEWANE TSE

                    GOVERNMENT’S MOTION TO DISMISS INDICTMENT

       Under Rule 48 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Government moves to

dismiss the Indictment in the above-captioned matter. The matter is presently not at trial and

the Government no longer seeks to pursue prosecution.

       The Government notes that pending before the Court in this case is a question of

interpretation relating to a decision on a motion to suppress statement and the possible need for

issuance of a clarification. That matter should be resolved prior to any decision on this request

to dismiss. Dismissal will result in closure of this case, and closure may interfere with the

Court’s ability to issue a clarification. The Government suggests that clarification be addressed

prior to the effectuation of any dismissal.


                                                     Respectfully submitted,

                                                     PETER F. NERONHA
