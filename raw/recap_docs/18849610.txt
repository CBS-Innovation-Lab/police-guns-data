                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                       DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

             v.                              Case No. 07-cr-144-01-SM

Richard Ellison

                                    ORDER

      Defendant Ellison’s motion to continue the final pretrial conference and

trial is granted (document 30). Trial has been rescheduled for the April 2008

trial period. Defendant Ellison shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights not later

than January 17, 2008.     On the filing of such waiver, his continuance shall be

effective.

      The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18

U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would

unreasonably deny defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances.

      Final Pretrial Conference: March 21, 2008 at 10:30 a.m.

      Jury Selection: April 1, 2008 at 9:30 a.m.
