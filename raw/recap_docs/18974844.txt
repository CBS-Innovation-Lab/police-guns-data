                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 11-cr-41-PB

Claudio Silva



                                  O R D E R


     The defendant has moved to continue the May 3, 2011 trial

in the above case, citing the need for additional time to engage

in plea negotiations or prepare a defense. The government does

not object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, in order to allow the parties additional time

to properly prepare for trial, the court will continue the trial

from May 3, 2011 to August 16, 2011. In agreeing to continue the

trial, the court finds pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ' 3161(h)(7)(A)

that for the above-stated reasons, the ends of justice served in

granting a continuance outweigh the best interests of the public

and the defendant in a speedy trial.
