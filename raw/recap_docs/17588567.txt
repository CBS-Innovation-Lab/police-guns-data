                        MEMORANDUM AND ORDER ON

STEARNS, D.J.
      Joseph Noe, proceeding pro se, brings this petition to vacate, set aside, or
correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.1 Noe argues that certain “erroneous
information” contained in his Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) has caused the



      1
         Section 2255 is not a substitute for direct appeal, but rather provides post-
conviction relief in four limited instances: “if the petitioner’s sentence was (1) imposed
in violation of the Constitution, or (2) was imposed by a court that lacked jurisdiction,
or (3) exceeded the statutory maximum, or (4) was otherwise subject to collateral
attack.” David v. United States, 134 F.3d 470, 474 (1st Cir. 1998). “The catch-all
fourth category includes only assignments of error that reveal ‘fundamental defect[s]’
which, if uncorrected, will ‘result[ ] in a complete miscarriage of justice,’ or
irregularities that are ‘inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.’”
Id., quoting Hill v. United States, 368 U.S. 424, 428 (1962). In other words, a
cognizable Section 2255 claim that does not raise constitutional or jurisdictional issues
must reveal “exceptional circumstances” that compel redress. Id. The petitioner bears
the burden of demonstrating an entitlement to relief. Mack v. United States, 635 F.2d
20, 26-27 (1st Cir. 1980).
Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to designate him to a more secure prison setting than
is necessary. For the reasons stated in the Government’s Opposition, the petition will
be DISMISSED. As the Government points out, Noe’s challenges to the PSR are not
cognizable under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, as they are directed not to the fact of his sentence,
but to its execution.2 Consequently, the proper vehicle (and only) for a sentence
challenge is a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241. See United States v. DiRusso, 535
F.2d 673, 675 (1st Cir. 1976). As Noe is currently confined at a BOP facility in
Allenwood, Pennsylvania, the court lacks jurisdiction over a properly brought petition.
See Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U.S. 426, 443 (2004) (a core habeas petition challenging
confinement may be heard only in the district where the prisoner is confined).
                                       ORDER
      For the foregoing reasons, Noe’s motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his
sentence is DENIED. The petition is DISMISSED with prejudice. The Clerk may now
close the case.3
                                        SO ORDERED.

      The 151-month sentence was imposed pursuant to a “take it or leave it” joint
recommendation of counsel under Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C).
      3
        Any request for the issuance of a Certificate of Appealability pursuant to 28
U.S.C. § 2253 is summarily DENIED, the court seeing no meritorious or substantial
basis supporting an appeal.
