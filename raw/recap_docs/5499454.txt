STATEMENT OF REASONS

VII COURT DETERMINATIONS OF RESTITUTION

A l____] Restitution Not Appllcable.

B Total Arnount of Restitution: 2’33 5'68

C Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

1 [:l For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number ot`
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(e)(3)(A).

2 [j For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(B).
3 l:] For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh

the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(1)(B)(ii).

4 l:l Restitution is not ordered for other reasons (Explain.)

D l:l Partial restitution is ordered for these reasons (18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)):
