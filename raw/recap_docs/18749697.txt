                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE




United States of America

     v.                                   Case No. 05-cr-131-01-PB

Nicole Saindon



                                  O R D E R


     The defendant has moved to continue the October 4, 2005

trial in the above case.        Defendant cites the need for additional

time to finalize plea negotiations.          The government does not

object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, in order to allow the parties additional time

to finalize plea negotiations or properly prepare for trial, the

court will continue the trial from October 4, 2005 to November 1,

2005.     In agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds

pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated

reasons, the ends of justice served in granting a continuance

outweigh the best interests of the public and the defendant in a

speedy trial.
