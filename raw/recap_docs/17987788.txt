              ORDER AFFIRMING RECOMMENDED DECISION
                     OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE


      On February 6, 2015, the United States Magistrate Judge filed with the
court, with a copy to the petitioner, his Recommended Decision on 28 U.S.C.
§ 2241 Motion.       The time within which to file an objection expired on
February 23, 2015, and no objection has been filed.        The Magistrate Judge
notified the petitioner that failure to object would waive his right to de novo
review and appeal.
      It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the Magistrate
Judge is hereby ADOPTED. In accordance with the gatekeeping provisions of 28
U.S.C. §§ 2244, 2255(h), the petitioner’s motion is DISMISSED without requiring
the Government to answer. A certificate of appealability pursuant to Rule 11 of
the Rules Governing Section 2255 Cases shall not issue because there is no
substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right within the meaning of
28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).

      SO ORDERED.
      DATED THIS 4TH DAY OF MARCH, 2014
                                              /S/D. BROCK HORNBY
