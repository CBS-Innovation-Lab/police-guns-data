                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 12-cr-52-02-PB

Ian Fitzmorris



                                  O R D E R


     The defendant has moved to continue the October 2, 2012

trial in the above case, citing the need for additional time to

participate in the pretrial diversion program.            The government

does not object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reason and in order to allow the

parties additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court

will continue the trial from October 2, 2012 to February 5,

2013.     In agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds

pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ' 3161(h)(7)(A) that for the above-stated

reasons, the ends of justice served in granting a continuance

outweigh the best interests of the public and the defendant in a

speedy trial.
