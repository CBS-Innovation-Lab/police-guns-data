                                            v.

                                 FREDERICK BONAMO



                                         ORDER

                                    January 14, 2014


ZOBEL, D.J.

       Frederick Bonamo has been charged with possession of Oxycodone with intent

to distribute and being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §

841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), respectively. He contends that the search warrant

for apartment one of a three-apartment building he owns on Harvard Street in Chelsea,

Massachusetts, lacked sufficient probable cause and moves to suppress all evidence

seized therefrom.

       The affidavit in support of the application for the search warrant states that a

confidential informant notified Chelsea police that defendant sold Oxycodone and other

prescription medications from the third floor apartment in which he lived. Docket # 34-1

at ¶ 3. The informant made several “controlled buys” of Oxycodone in apartment three.

Id. at ¶¶ 7-9. Further investigation revealed that defendant’s mother formerly lived in

apartment one, but the apartment had remained vacant since her death. Id. at ¶ 5.

Defendant had access to apartment one, and his name was listed on its utility account.

Id. Records indicated “minimal usage” of electricity therein. Id. The magistrate issued

the search warrant for apartments one and three based on this evidence.

      Defendant and the government offer competing characterizations of the

relationship between apartments one and three. Defendant portrays apartment one as

entirely distinct and separate from apartment three. The government describes

apartment one as an appurtenant area to apartment three. In fact, it is neither.

Reading the affidavit in a “practical, common sense fashion,” United States v. Zayas-

Diaz, 95 F.3d 105, 111 (1st Cir. 1996) (quotation and citation omitted), I note that

although apartment one is numerically separate, it is in the same building in which

defendant lives, and defendant had easy access to it. Although police documented

defendant dealing drugs from apartment three on multiple occasions, utility records

showed at least some usage of apartment one. These facts are sufficient to

demonstrate at least a “fair probability” that evidence of a crime would be found in

apartment one. Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238 (1983) (defining probable cause).

      This is not an open-and-shut case; indeed, it is marginal. In such cases,

however, I must defer to the issuing magistrate’s determination of probable cause.

United States v. Barnard, 299 F.3d 90, 93 (1st Cir. 2002). For that reason, and on the

merits, defendant’s motion to suppress (Docket # 33) is DENIED.
