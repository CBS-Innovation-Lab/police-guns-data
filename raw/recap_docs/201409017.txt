 GOVERNMENT’S MOTION TO SEAL IS RESPONSE TO THE COURT’S AUGUST 6, 2021
                  ORDER AND THIS MOTION TO SEAL
        The United States of America requests that the Court seal this motion and the

 government’s response to the Court’s August 6, 2021 order concerning the unsealing of

 documents related to Dawlin Cabrera’s cooperation. ECF No. 1088.

        The government’s response asks the Court to extend the seal of the documents

 concerning Cabrera’s cooperation until the termination of his supervised release and contains

 information about the defendant’s cooperation reflected in the presently sealed documents.

 Thus, the government’s response should be sealed until the documents subject to the Court’s

 August 6, 2021 order are unsealed. The government therefore requests that its response to the

 Court’s August 6, 2021 and this motion be sealed for the same duration as the documents subject

 to the Court’s August 6, 2021 order.

                                                     Respectfully submitted,

                                                     Merrick B. Garland
