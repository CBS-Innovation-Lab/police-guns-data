     ORDER ON DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS INDICTMENT

      Charged with possession of a firearm after being convicted of a misdemeanor

crime of domestic violence under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9), Tobin White moves to

dismiss the indictment, claiming that because the Maine misdemeanor assault

statute allows for a conviction based upon offensive physical contact, the United

States Supreme Court decision of Johnson v. United States, 559 U.S. 133 (2010),

requires that his assault conviction not be considered a predicate conviction as a

misdemeanor crime of domestic violence under § 922(g)(9).       Because the First

Circuit already rejected this argument in United States v. Armstrong, 706 F.3d 1

(1st Cir. 2013), this Court applies existing First Circuit precedent and denies Mr.

White’s motion.

I.    STATEMENT OF FACTS

      On June 13, 2013, a federal grand jury issued an indictment against Tobin

White, charging him with possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a

misdemeanor crime of domestic violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9).

Indictment (ECF No. 1). Specifically, the indictment alleged that on February 12,

2013, Mr. White possessed a firearm, after he had been convicted of assault in
    Case 1:13-cr-00106-JAW Document 21 Filed 10/18/13 Page 2 of 5                    PageID #: 89



violation of title 17-A, section 207 of the Maine Revised Statutes. Id. Under Maine

law, a person is guilty of assault if he “intentionally, knowingly or recklessly causes

bodily injury or offensive physical contact to another person.”                    17-A M.R.S. §

207(1)(A).

II.     THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

        On September 23, 2013, Mr. White moved to dismiss the indictment. Mr.

White asserts that Johnson v. United States requires dismissal because—absent

clarifying Shepard-permissible documents1—the state assault to which he pleaded

guilty in 2003 may have involved only “offensive physical contact,” and this level of

contact does not qualify as a crime of domestic violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. §

922(g)(9) as interpreted in Johnson.2 Def.’s Mot. to Dismiss (ECF No. 18). Mr.

White contends that the Johnson Court’s analysis of the definition of “physical

force” for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) should “be

extrapolated” to guide this Court as to whether non-violent offensive physical

contact under the Maine domestic assault statute is a “misdemeanor crime of

violence” under § 922(g)(9). Id. at 3. As such, Mr. White maintains that his Maine


1       In Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13 (2005), the United States Supreme Court allowed a
sentencing court to take into consideration certain limited documents to determine the facts
underlying a prior conviction under the Armed Career Criminal Act. Id. at 25. Here, there are no
Shepard documents that permit this Court to clarify the facts underlying Mr. White’s assault
conviction. See Def.’s Mot. to Dismiss at 5 (“the Shepard materials do not provide the Court any
assistance in discerning whether the Defendant was convicted of an offense involving force with
violence or not”).
2       The Maine criminal complaint reads:

        On or about February 14, 2003, in Bradford, Penobscot County, Maine, TOBIN
        WHITE, did intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly cause bodily injury or offensive
        physical contact to Brandy White.

assault conviction should not count as a predicate misdemeanor crime of domestic

violence for purposes of his alleged firearm possession and that the indictment must

be dismissed. Id. at 2-5. The Government objects, contending that Mr. White’s

argument runs contrary to settled First Circuit law. Gov’t’s Resp. to Def.’s Mot. to

Dismiss Indictment (ECF No. 20).

III.   DISCUSSION

       The First Circuit has considered and firmly rejected Mr. White’s argument.

Before Johnson, the First Circuit decided United States v. Nason, 269 F.3d 10 (1st

Cir. 2001), in which it reasoned that offensive physical contact in the Maine

misdemeanor assault statute “by necessity, requires physical force to complete.” Id.

at 21 (quoting United States v. Smith, 171 F.3d 617, 621 n.2 (8th Cir. 1999)). On

this basis, the First Circuit concluded that convictions for offensive physical contact

assaults “upon persons in the requisite relationship status qualify as misdemeanor

crimes of domestic violence within the purview of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9).” Id.

       In United States v. Booker, 644 F.3d 12 (1st Cir. 2011), the First Circuit

addressed whether Johnson’s holding on the ACCA required a reassessment of

Nason. Noting that the “case for analogizing § 922(g)(9) to § 16 [of the ACCA] is

particularly weak,” and that the Supreme Court itself had “rejected the notion that

its case law interpreting the phrase ‘use . . . of physical force’ under the ACCA

would control the interpretation of that phrase under § 922(g)(9),” the First Circuit

declined to interpret “the statutory definition of ‘misdemeanor crime of domestic

violence’” as prescribing “an intentional mens rea.” Id. at 19-21. The First Circuit



                                          3
 Case 1:13-cr-00106-JAW Document 21 Filed 10/18/13 Page 4 of 5           PageID #: 91



in Booker thus held that “an offense with a mens rea of recklessness may qualify as

a ‘misdemeanor crime of domestic violence’ under § 922(g)(9).” Id. at 21.

      The First Circuit’s view as to whether a violation of the “offensive physical

contact” portion of Maine’s assault statute after Johnson would satisfy the

“misdemeanor crime of domestic violence” language in § 922(g)(9) might have been

predicted from Nason and Booker.           However, this exact question remained

unanswered until Armstrong, where the First Circuit addressed the precise issue

Mr. White now raises in his motion to dismiss. See 706 F.3d at 2-6. Mr. Armstrong

contended that “18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9) should be construed to exclude a purportedly

non-violent offensive physical contact misdemeanor conviction as a predicate

offense.” Id. at 2. The Armstrong Court wrote that Mr. Armstrong’s “attempt to

challenge this court’s precedent through the Supreme Court’s ruling in Johnson v.

United States is unavailing.” Id. at 6. The First Circuit “fail[ed] to see how a

conviction for an offensive touching such as the offensive physical contact for which

Armstrong was convicted fails to constitute a predicate offense based on our prior

interpretation of § 922(g)(9) predicate offense requirements of ‘physical force’.” Id.

IV.   CONCLUSION

      The First Circuit’s trilogy of Nason, Booker, and Armstrong dooms Mr.

White’s motion to dismiss the indictment and the Court therefore DENIES Tobin

White’s Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 18).
