                                  ORDER OF DETENTION
                              PENDING REVOCATION HEARING

       On February 25, 2008, the defendant, Anthony Dorothy, appeared before this Court for an

initial appearance, pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus issued on January 18, 2008.

       Pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.1, the defendant appeared on February

25, 2008, before this Court with counsel for preliminary hearing to determine whether there was

probable cause to believe he had violated a condition of his supervised release. The defendant

waived any formal hearing and based upon the allegations in the petition for revocation, I find

probable cause to believe that the defendant has violated a condition of his supervised release.

       Pursuant to Rule 46(c), Fed. R. Crim. P., the defendant has the burden of establishing that

there are conditions or combinations of conditions which will reasonably assure the safety of

another person or the community and that there is no danger that he will flee. Defendant waived

hearing on these issues as well and I find that he has failed to meet his burden.

       I am satisfied that the defendant's waiver was made voluntarily, knowingly and

intelligently, and I hereby accept the same. Accordingly, I ORDER that the defendant be

detained pending a revocation hearing set for Monday, March 17, 2008, at 9:30 a.m., in Bangor,

Maine, before U.S. District Court Judge John A. Woodcock, Jr.

         The defendant is committed to the custody of the Attorney General or his designated

representative for confinement in a corrections facility separate, to the extent practicable, from

persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody pending appeal. The defendant

shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity for private consultation with defense counsel. On

order of a court of the United States or on request of an attorney for the Government, the person

in charge of the corrections facility shall deliver the defendant to the United States marshal for

the purposes of an appearance in connection with a court proceeding.

       So Ordered.
