             RECOMMENDED DECISION ON 28 U.S.C. § 2255 MOTION

        Following the First Circuit’s grant of leave to file a second or successive motion,

Petitioner George Yeaton, III, moves, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255, to vacate, set aside or

correct his sentence. (Motion, ECF No. 38; Yeaton v. United States, No. 16-1667 (1st Cir.

June 21, 2016).)1 After a guilty plea, Petitioner was convicted of being a felon in

possession of a firearm; the Court found Petitioner to be an armed career criminal, pursuant

to the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1). The Court sentenced

Petitioner to 400 months in prison. (Judgment, ECF No. 32 at 1-2.)

        In his pending section 2255 motion, Petitioner challenges his sentence based on

Johnson v. United States, --- U.S. ---, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015) (Johnson II).2 He argues that

   The First Circuit ordered the transfer of Petitioner’s filings to the district court for filing as a
28 U.S.C. § 2255 motion. (Yeaton v. United States, No. 16-1667 (1st Cir. June 21, 2016).) The transferred
filings are docketed in this Court as ECF No. 38.

his two prior Maine burglary convictions do not qualify as ACCA predicate offenses

following Mathis v. United States, --- U.S. ---, 136 S. Ct. 2243 (2016).                           (Reply,

ECF No. 45.) He also argues that his two prior Maine robbery convictions and his prior

Maine conviction for terrorizing with a dangerous weapon do not qualify as ACCA

predicates under the “force clause,” section 924(e)(2)(B)(i). (Id.)

        Following a review of Petitioner’s motion, the Government’s request for dismissal,

and the record, I recommend that the Court deny Petitioner’s section 2255 motion, but that

the Court grant a certificate of appealability as set forth below.

                I.      FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

        Petitioner was indicted in December 2004 for being a felon in possession of a

firearm, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1), 924(e). (Indictment, ECF No. 1.) The

indictment alleged several prior Maine state felony convictions, including the following:

a 1986 robbery conviction (No. CR-85-350, Me. Super. Ct., Oxford Cty., Jan. 15, 1986);

a 1988 terrorizing conviction (No. CR-87-589, Me. Super. Ct., Ken. Cty, Jan. 20, 1988);

a 1989 robbery conviction (No. CR-89-78, Me. Super. Ct., And. Cty., Feb. 9, 1989);

a 1994 burglary conviction (No. CR-94-167, Me. Super. Ct., Oxf. Cty., Nov. 2, 1994); and

a 1998 burglary conviction (No. CR-97-716, Me. Super. Ct., And. Cty., Apr. 6, 1998).3

(Id. at 1-2.)


3
  The federal indictment lists the 1986 conviction (No. 85-350, Me. Super. Ct., Oxf. Cty., Jan. 15, 1986) as
a robbery. (Indictment, ECF No. 1 at 1.) The Court found the facts as stated in the revised presentence
investigation report, which lists the 1986 conviction as a burglary conviction. (Sentencing Tr., ECF No. 36
at 90.) The Government represents that although burglary was one of the three offenses charged in 1986,
the offense of conviction was robbery. (Response, ECF No. 44 at 3, 6 & n.3; Attachment, Judgment and
Commitment, ECF No. 44-1 at 1.) Petitioner agrees that the 1986 conviction was for robbery. (Reply, ECF
No. 45 at 1; Attachment, ECF No. 45-1.)

                                                     2

       Petitioner pled guilty to the felon-in-possession charge in February 2005. (Minute

Entry for Change of Plea Hearing, ECF No. 19.) At sentencing, the Court found the facts

as set forth in the revised presentence investigation report, and the Court’s sentencing

guidelines calculations were as follows: The base offense level was 24, pursuant to

USSG § 2K2.1(a)(2), because Petitioner had two prior felony violent crimes. (Sentencing

Tr., ECF No. 36 at 90.) The revised presentence investigation report lists the robbery and

burglary convictions identified above as the prior convictions on which the application of

section 2K2.1(a)(2) was based.

       The Court concluded that the total offense level was 41, based on the following:

four levels were added to the base offense level, pursuant to USSG § 2K2.1(b)(5), because

Petitioner possessed the firearm in connection with another felony offense, namely, gross

sexual assault; the offense level was raised to 40, pursuant to USSG §§ 2K2.1(c)(1)(A),

2X1.1, based on the application of the base offense level for the substantive offense of

gross sexual assault; two levels were added, pursuant to USSG § 3D1.4, to determine the

combined offense level; two levels were added, pursuant to USSG § 3A1.3, because the

victims were physically restrained with duct tape or rope during the offense; and three

levels were subtracted, pursuant to USSG § 3E1.1, for acceptance of responsibility. (Id. at

90-92.) The Court determined, pursuant to USSG § 4B1.4(b)(1), that because the total

offense level of 41, which was applicable under Chapter Two of the Guidelines, was higher

than the level that would apply under the armed career criminal provisions, the higher

offense level of 41 applied. (Id. at 92.)

Case 2:04-cr-00123-GZS Document 49 Filed 03/30/17 Page 4 of 18               PageID #: 286



       The Court found Petitioner to be an armed career criminal, pursuant to

18 U.S.C. § 924(e), and the Court found a criminal history category of VI. (Id. at 92-93.)

The Court concluded that a total offense level of 41, combined with a criminal history

category of VI, resulted in a sentencing guidelines range of 360 months to life

imprisonment. (Id. at 93.)

       The Court next considered all of the sentencing factors, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.

§ 3553(a). The Court focused particularly on the need for just punishment, deterrence,

public protection, and rehabilitation. (Id. at 93.) The Court ordered the 400-month

sentence to run concurrently with any undischarged term of imprisonment imposed in state

court, pursuant to USSG § 5G1.3(b)(2). (Id. at 95-96.) The Court also imposed a term of

five years of supervised release. (Id. at 96; Judgment at 3.)

       In 2007, the Court dismissed Petitioner’s prior section 2255 motion as untimely.

Yeaton v. United States, No. 2:06-cv-00138-GZS (Recommended Decision, ECF No. 21;

Order Affirming, ECF No. 22.) In June 2016, the First Circuit granted Petitioner’s

application for leave to file a second or successive section 2255 motion, based on

Johnson II. (Yeaton, No. 16-1667 (1st Cir. June 21, 2016).) The First Circuit stated: “The

application is granted, but we express no opinion as to the ultimate merit of the claim.”

(Id.) The First Circuit ordered that upon transfer of Petitioner’s filings to this Court, the

motion be deemed filed in this Court on May 19, 2016, which was the date on which

Petitioner filed in the First Circuit. (Id.)

                                           II.     DISCUSSION

          A person may move to vacate his or her sentence on one of four different grounds:

(1) “that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United

States”; (2) “that the court was without jurisdiction” to impose its sentence; (3) “that the

sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law”; or (4) that the sentence

“is otherwise subject to collateral attack.” 28 U.S.C. § 2255(a); see Knight v. United States,

37 F.3d 769, 772 (1st Cir. 1994). Petitioner argues that the sentence is unconstitutional

under Johnson II, that his ACCA status therefore must be re-established under current law,

and that his prior burglary and robbery convictions do not qualify under current law as

ACCA predicate violent felonies.4

          In Johnson II, the Supreme Court “struck down the ‘residual clause’ of the [ACCA]

as unconstitutionally vague.”5 Pakala v. United States, 804 F.3d 139, 139 (1st Cir. 2015)


4
  It is undisputed that all of the prior crimes at issue qualify as felonies under the Armed Career Criminal
Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1); the issue is whether they qualify as ACCA violent felonies. The prior
crimes were felonies because they were “punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,”
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B). According to the revised presentence investigation report, Petitioner
committed the felonies from 1985 to 1997. Although the Maine statute that sets forth the terms of
imprisonment for various classes of crimes, 17-A M.R.S. § 1252(2), was amended during the time relevant
to Petitioner’s offenses, the amendment did not alter the ACCA felony status of any of Petitioner’s prior
crimes.
5
    In Johnson II, the Supreme Court explained:

          Federal law forbids certain people—such as convicted felons, persons committed to mental
          institutions, and drug users—to ship, possess, and receive firearms. [18 U.S.C. § 922(g)].
          In general, the law punishes violation of this ban by up to 10 years’ imprisonment.
          [18 U.S.C. § 924(a)(2)]. But if the violator has three or more earlier convictions for a
          “serious drug offense” or a “violent felony,” the Armed Career Criminal Act increases his
          prison term to a minimum of 15 years and a maximum of life. § 924(e)(1); [Johnson I,
          559 U.S. at 136]. The Act defines “violent felony” as follows:

          “any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year . . . that—


                                                      5
Case 2:04-cr-00123-GZS Document 49 Filed 03/30/17 Page 6 of 18                               PageID #: 288



(per curiam). The Supreme Court, however, explicitly limited its holding in Johnson II to

exclude claims based on challenges to “the four enumerated offenses, or the remainder of

the Act’s definition of a violent felony.” Johnson II, 135 S. Ct. at 2563. Thus, the

enumerated crimes clause of section 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), as well as the force clause, section

924(e)(2)(B)(i), remain valid after Johnson II.

          Although the substance of Petitioner’s argument is based on the enumerated crimes

clause and the force clause, Petitioner argues preliminarily that his motion is timely under

section 2255(f)(3), notwithstanding the Supreme Court’s decision in Johnson II that the

holding excludes claims that are based on the enumerated crimes and force clauses of

section 924(e)(2)(B).6          (Reply at 2-3, 18.)          Petitioner argues essentially that after



          “(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against
          the person of another; or

          “(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves
          conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.” § 924(e)(2)(B)
          (emphasis added).

          The closing words of this definition, italicized above, have come to be known as the Act's
          residual clause.

Johnson II, 135 S. Ct. at 2555-56. The Court held that the residual clause is unconstitutionally vague. Id.
at 2557. In Welch v. United States, --- U.S. ---, ---, 136 S. Ct. 1257, 1268 (2016), the Supreme Court held
that “Johnson[II] announced a substantive rule that has retroactive effect in cases on collateral review.”
6
    Title 28 U.S.C.§ 2255(f) provides:

          A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a motion under this section. The limitation
          period shall run from the latest of −

              (1) the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final;

              (2) the date on which the impediment to making a motion created by governmental
              action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the
              movant was prevented from making a motion by such governmental action;

Johnson II, his prior crimes may not be considered ACCA predicates under the residual

clause, and, therefore, the prior crimes must be re-established as ACCA predicates under

either the enumerated crimes clause or the force clause, as interpreted under current law.

(Reply at 2-3, 18.) He contends that, following Mathis, he lacks the requisite three ACCA

predicate violent felonies.7

        A. The Maine burglary convictions

        Two of the prior convictions on which Petitioner’s ACCA status was based were

Maine burglary offenses, under 17-A M.R.S. § 401; Petitioner committed the burglaries in




             (3) the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court,
             if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively
             applicable to cases on collateral review; or

             (4) the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have
             been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.
7
 Mathis v. United States, --- U.S. ---, 136 S. Ct. 2243 (2016), is one of a line of cases involving the statutory
interpretation of the term “burglary” as used in section 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). See Mathis, 136 S. Ct. at 2247-50;
Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 23 (2005) (“We are, after all, dealing with an issue of statutory
interpretation.”) (citing Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 602 (1990)). In Mathis, the Supreme Court
recognized the long-standing rule that a prior conviction will not qualify as a predicate “violent felony”
under the ACCA unless “its elements are the same as, or narrower than, those of the generic offense.”
136 S. Ct. at 2247. The Court held that the inclusion of land, water or air vehicles, as well as buildings and
structures, in Iowa’s burglary statute rendered the “locational element” of the crime broader than generic
burglary, which includes only buildings and structures. 136 S. Ct. at 2250. The Supreme Court held that
the Eighth Circuit erred when it affirmed the district court’s use of a modified categorical approach, which
had permitted a review of the record to determine the location where the burglary took place, because under
the ACCA, “it is impermissible for ‘a particular crime [to] sometimes count towards enhancement and
sometimes not, depending on the facts of the case.’” Id. at 2250-51 (quoting Taylor, 495 U.S. at 601).
Petitioner concedes that Mathis does not apply retroactively. (Reply at 2.) See Mathis, 136 S. Ct. at 2251-
52 (noting that the Court’s prior precedent, including Descamps v. United States, --- U.S. ---, ---, 133 S. Ct.
2276, 2283 (2013), indicated the rule was not new); Dimott v. United States, Nos. 2:06-cr-26-GZS, 2:16-

1994 and 1997, according to the revised presentence investigation report.8 Burglary is one

of the offenses enumerated in section 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) of the ACCA as a violent felony.



8
    Maine’s burglary statute, 17-A M.R.S. § 401, provides in part:

          A person is guilty of burglary if:

              A. The person enters or surreptitiously remains in a structure knowing that that
              person is not licensed or privileged to do so, with the intent to commit a crime therein.
              Violation of this paragraph is a Class C crime; or

              B. The person violates paragraph A and:

                  (1)    The person is armed with a firearm, or knows that an accomplice is so
                  armed. Violation of this subparagraph is a Class A crime;

                  (2)     The person intentionally or recklessly inflicts or attempts to inflict bodily
                  injury on anyone during the commission of the burglary or an attempt to commit
                  the burglary or in immediate flight after the commission or attempt. Violation of
                  this subparagraph is a Class B crime;

                  (3)    The person is armed with a dangerous weapon other than a firearm or
                  knows that an accomplice is so armed. Violation of this subparagraph is a Class
                  B crime.

                  (4)     The violation is against a structure that is a dwelling place. Violation of
                  this subparagraph is a Class B crime.

17-A M.R.S. § 401(1) (emphasis added). The terms “structure” and “dwelling place” are defined as follows:

           “Structure” means a building or other place designed to provide protection for persons or
          property against weather or intrusion, but does not include vehicles and other conveyances
          whose primary purpose is transportation of persons or property unless such vehicle or
          conveyance, or a section thereof, is also a dwelling place.

17-A M.R.S. § 2(24).

          “Dwelling place” means a structure which is adapted for overnight accommodation of
          persons, or sections of any structure similarly adapted. A dwelling place does not include
          garages or other structures, whether adjacent or attached to the dwelling place, which are
          used solely for the storage of property or structures formerly used as dwelling places which
          are uninhabitable. It is immaterial whether a person is actually present.

17-A M.R.S. § 2(10). Although the relevant portions of sections 401 and 2(24) have not been amended
since the time of the offenses, section 2(10) has since been amended, and, as a result, the current version of
section 2(10) is different from the text quoted above.

        Petitioner argues that Mathis overrules the First Circuit’s decision in United States

v. Duquette, 778 F.3d 314 (1st Cir. 2015), in which the Court determined that the Maine

burglary statute covers the offense of generic burglary, and that a Maine burglary

conviction therefore qualifies as a violent felony under the enumerated crimes clause of the

ACCA.9 (Reply at 19-20.) Petitioner argues that, under Mathis, and contrary to Duquette,

Maine burglary must be considered broader than generic burglary, in part because the

definition of “structure,” as set forth in 17-A M.R.S. § 2(24), includes vehicles and

conveyances, similar to the Iowa law at issue in Mathis. (Reply at 6, 10-13.) Petitioner

also argues that under Maine law, the locational element of burglary is not divisible. See

Descamps v. United States, 133 S. Ct. 2276, 2284 (2013) (noting that a “so-called ‘divisible

statute’ . . . sets out one or more elements of the offense in the alternative”). (Reply at 8.)

        This Court has concluded that in this circuit, Duquette “‘establishes that Maine

burglary convictions are “violent felonies” pursuant to ACCA’s enumerated clause,’” even

after Mathis. McCurdy v. United States, Nos. 1:06-cr-00080-JAW, 1:15-cv-00532-JAW,

  In United States v. Duquette, 778 F.3d 314 (1st Cir. 2015), the First Circuit held that “because Maine’s
burglary statute sets forth the definition of ‘generic burglary,’ under Taylor, a conviction under that statute
qualifies as a ‘violent felony’ under the ACCA.” 778 F.3d at 318. In Taylor, the Supreme Court had
announced: “We conclude that a person has been convicted of burglary for purposes of a § 924(e)
enhancement if he is convicted of any crime, regardless of its exact definition or label, having the basic
elements of unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to
commit a crime.” 495 U.S. at 599.

        Petitioner asserts that his case is distinguishable from Dimott, and he requests that

this Court “rule on, or address whether Maine burglary meets the generic definition of

burglary, even if the court ultimately concludes it is bound by Duquette.” (Reply at 1 &

n.2, 3 & n.3.) McCurdy, Dimott, Collamore, Casey are pending on appeal in the First

Circuit as to the issues Petitioner raises here.11 The issue regarding Petitioner’s burglary

convictions does not differ materially from the issue presented in McCurdy, Dimott,




10
  In Dimott, the petitioner argued that, following the Supreme Court’s decisions in Johnson II and Mathis,
“he no longer has the three requisite convictions for an increased sentence under ACCA,” and “Maine
burglary no longer fits within the generic definition of burglary because Maine’s locational element is
overly broad in light of Mathis.” Dimott, 2016 WL 6068114, at *2, 2016 U.S. Dist. Lexis 142354, at *4-5.
The Court concluded that, [a]ssuming the Court could undertake a timely review of Dimott’s predicate
burglary convictions,” there is “no basis for concluding that Mathis should be read as overruling Duquette.

U.S. Dist. Lexis 1947 (D. Me. Jan. 6, 2017), the Court granted the petitioner relief on the basis that the
petitioner’s prior robberies “do not meet the violent force requirement of the ACCA as explained by the
Supreme Court in Johnson I and Johnson II.” 2017 WL 74695, at *10, 2017 U.S. Dist. Lexis 1947, at

because it requires three, did not apply. The Government has appealed from the judgment, and it has moved

Collamore, and Casey. Accordingly, I can discern no reason the issue should be resolved

differently in this case.

        B. The Maine robbery convictions

        Petitioner was convicted of Class A robbery, 17-A M.R.S. § 651, in 1986 and

1989.12 (Response at 12; Attachments, ECF Nos. 44-1 at 5, 44-2 at 1.) Petitioner contends

that Maine robbery does not qualify as an ACCA predicate under the force clause. (Reply

at 23-25.)




12
  At the time of the offenses, which Petitioner committed in 1985 and 1988, according to the revised
presentence investigation report, 17-A M.R.S. § 651 provided:

        1.      A person is guilty of robbery if he commits or attempts to commit theft and at the
        time of his actions:

             A. He recklessly inflicts bodily injury on another;

             B. He threatens to use force against any person present with intent

                     1. to prevent or overcome resistance to the taking of the property, or to the
                     retention of the property immediately after the taking; or

                     2. to compel the person in control of the property to give it up or to engage
                     in other conduct which aids in the taking or carrying away of the property;

             C. He uses physical force on another with the intent enumerated in paragraph B,
             subparagraphs (1) or (2);

             D. He intentionally inflicts or attempts to inflict bodily injury on another; or

             E. He or an accomplice to his knowledge is armed with a dangerous weapon in the
             course of a robbery as defined in paragraphs A through D.

        2.     Robbery as defined in subsection 1, paragraphs A and B, is a Class B crime.
        Robbery as defined in subsection 1, paragraphs C, D, and E is a Class A Crime.

P.L. 1975, ch. 740, § 73. Section 651 has since been amended, and, as a result, the current version of the
statute is different from the text quoted above.

        The Maine robbery statute is divisible, and therefore Shepard-approved documents

may be presented at sentencing, when such documents are available, to enable the Court,

using a modified categorical approach, to determine whether the “robbery conviction

necessarily involved ‘force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.’”

Jackson v. United States, Nos. 2:06-cr-94-GZS, 2:16-cv-187-GZS, 2016 WL 3167073, at

*1-2, 2016 U.S. Dist. Lexis 73052, at*3-4. (D. Me. June 6, 2016) (quoting Johnson I,

559 U.S. at 140).13          The Government represents that the charging instruments in

Petitioner’s case are not available, but it notes that because the offenses were charged as

Class A crimes, the convictions necessarily were pursuant to 17-A M.R.S. § 651(1)(C),

(D), or (E). (Response at 12-13.)

        In other cases in this District, the Court concluded that prior Maine robbery

convictions under sections 651(1)(C) and (E) did not qualify as ACCA predicates under

the force clause. See Jackson, 2016 WL 3167073, at *3, 2016 U.S. Dist. Lexis 73052, at

*5-6 (addressing section 651(1)(C)); McCurdy, 2017 WL 74695, at *9, 2017 U.S. Dist.

Lexis 1947, at *24-25 (addressing section 651(1)(E)).

        In Jackson, the Court held that a conviction under section 651(1)(C) did not qualify

as an ACCA predicate because, under Maine case law, a robbery may be committed “with


13
  In Taylor, the Supreme Court adopted a “formal categorical approach, looking only to the statutory
definitions of the prior offenses, and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions,” to determine
whether a prior offense qualified as an ACCA predicate. 495 U.S. at 600. In Descamps, the Supreme Court
noted that in Taylor, it “recognized ‘a narrow range of cases’ in which sentencing courts−applying what we
would later dub the ‘modified categorical approach’−may look beyond the statutory elements to ‘the
charging paper and jury instructions’ used in a case.” 133 S. Ct. at 2283-84 (quoting Taylor, 495 U.S. at
602, and discussing Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13 (2005)).

physical force that is less than the force capable of causing physical pain or injury to

another person.” 2016 WL 3167073, at *2-3, 2016 U.S. Dist. Lexis 73052, at *6-7 (citing

Johnson I, 135 S. Ct. at 2557, and discussing Raymond v. State, 467 A.2d 161 (Me. 1983),

State v. Rembert, 658 A.2d 656 (Me. 1995)). The Court explained:

       Examining the Shepard-approved documents in Jackson’s robbery case, the
       Court cannot conclude that the physical force Jackson used upon his victim
       to extract the money, which was the focus of the theft element, was
       necessarily force capable of causing physical pain or injury to the victim. In
       short, the Court concludes that Jackson’s 1998 Maine [r]obbery conviction
       is not an ACCA-qualifying conviction as a “violent felony” under the “force
       clause.”

2016 WL 3167073, at *3, 2016 U.S. Dist. Lexis 73052, at *6-7 (citing 18 U.S.C.

§ 924(e)(2)(B)(i)).14

       In McCurdy, the Court held that a conviction under section 651(1)(E) did not qualify

as an ACCA predicate. McCurdy, 2017 WL 74695, at *9, 2017 U.S. Dist. Lexis 1947, at

*24-25. The Court noted that the case law is unclear as to whether the degree of force

required under Johnson I, 559 U.S. at 140, is met when the prior conviction is under section

651(1)(E). McCurdy, 2017 WL 74695, at *9, 2017 U.S. Dist. Lexis 1947, at *24. The

Court reasoned that

       by its terms, the Maine statute does not require that the robber actively use
       the weapon to commit the robbery in order to violate section 651(1)(E), only
       that the robber possess it “in the course of the robbery.” [17-A M.R.S.
       § 651(1)(E).] Without more, the possession of a firearm during a robbery
       does not therefore transform the robbery to one where the robber used
       “violent force” under the ACCA’s force clause.


14
  The Government has appealed from the judgment in Jackson v. United States, Nos. 2:06-cr-94-GZS,
2:16-cv-187-GZS, 2016 WL 3167073, 2016 U.S. Dist. Lexis 73052 (D. Me. June 6, 2016). The appeal is
docketed in the First Circuit at No. 16-1921.

McCurdy, 2017 WL 74695, at *9, 2017 U.S. Dist. Lexis 1947, at *24-25.

          Because the Court has established that a prior Maine robbery conviction under either

section 651(1)(C) or (E) may not qualify as a predicate under the ACCA’s force clause in

the absence of adequate Shepard-approved documents, and because there are no such

documents in Petitioner’s case, Petitioner’s prior robbery convictions do not qualify as

ACCA predicate offenses.

          C. The Maine terrorizing conviction

          According to the revised presentence investigation report, Petitioner was convicted

of the offense of terrorizing with a weapon in 1988. The criminal history section of the

report lists the offense as one on which Petitioner’s status as an armed career criminal was

based. The Government argues that the terrorizing conviction qualifies as an ACCA

predicate offense under the force clause. (Response at 17-19.) Petitioner maintains the

terrorizing conviction does not qualify. (Reply at 25-26.)15



15
     At the time of Petitioner’s conviction, 17-A M.R.S. § 210 provided:

          1.      A person is guilty of terrorizing if he communicates to any person a threat to
          commit or to cause to be committed a crime of violence dangerous to human life, against
          the person to whom the communication is made or another, and the natural and probable
          consequence of such a threat, whether or not such consequence in fact occurs, is:

              A. To place the person to whom the threat is communicated or the person threatened
              in reasonable fear that the crime will be committed; or

              B. To cause evacuation of a building, place of assembly or facility of public transport.

          2.      Violation of subsection 1, paragraph A, is a Class D crime. Violation of subsection
          1, paragraph B, is a Class C crime.

P.L. 1977, ch. 510, § 45; P.L. 1977, ch. 671, §§ 23, 24. Section 210 has since been amended, and, as a
result, the current version of the statute is different from the text quoted above.


                                                      14
Case 2:04-cr-00123-GZS Document 49 Filed 03/30/17 Page 15 of 18                             PageID #: 297



        The Government concedes that a conviction under 17-A M.R.S. § 210, without

more, would not qualify as a felony under the ACCA, because a violation under one of the

subsections was a Class D crime punishable by less than one year in jail. (Response at 18.)

The Government, however, argues that the offense is an ACCA violent felony because the

sentencing class was elevated, pursuant to 17-A M.R.S. § 1252(4), due to the fact that

Petitioner committed the offense with a dangerous weapon.16 (Id.)

        For an offense to qualify as a violent felony under the force clause, it must have “as

an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of

another.” 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(i). “‘Elements’ are the ‘constituent parts’ of a crime’s

legal definition−the things the ‘prosecution must prove to sustain a conviction.’” Mathis,

136 S. Ct. at 2248. (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 634 (10th ed. 2014)). The Court

looks to state law to determine the elements of the offense of conviction. See United States

v. Tavares, 843 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 2016) (noting that “[t]he substantive definition of

[assault and battery with a dangerous weapon] . . . is supplied by case law applying the

crime’s common law definition”) (citing, inter alia, Commonwealth v. Porro, 458 Mass.

526, 939 N.E.2d 1157, 1162 (2010)); United States v. Whindleton, 797 F.3d 105, 112

(1st Cir. 2015) (“‘The crime of [assault with a dangerous weapon] adds one additional

element, namely, that the assault was perpetrated by means of a dangerous weapon.’”)



16
  Section 1252(4) provides in pertinent part: “If the State pleads and proves that a Class B, C, D or E crime
was committed with the use of a dangerous weapon then the sentencing class for such crime is one class
higher than it would otherwise be.” (Id.) Thus, if a terrorizing conviction were pursuant to
17-A M.R.S. § 210(1)(A), the sentencing class would be elevated from Class D to Class C, and if a
conviction were pursuant to section 210(1)(B), the sentencing class would be elevated from Class C to
Class B.

Case 2:04-cr-00123-GZS Document 49 Filed 03/30/17 Page 16 of 18               PageID #: 298



(quoting Commonwealth v. Melton, 436 Mass. 291, 763 N.E.2d 1092, 1096 (2002)). The

Maine Law Court evidently considers the use of a dangerous weapon in the commission of

a crime, pursuant to 17-A M.R.S. § 1252(4), to be an element of the crime. See State v.

Kline, 2013 ME 54, ¶ 10, 66 A.3d 581 (noting that “the evidence was sufficient for the jury

to have rationally found each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt,” and citing

17-A M.R.S. §§ 211(1), 1252(4)).

       The analysis of whether Petitioner’s prior offense of terrorizing with a dangerous

weapon qualifies as an ACCA offense is similar to the analysis in Whindleton, in which

the First Circuit concluded that on a conviction for assault with a dangerous weapon, the

dangerous-weapon component of the crime comprised an element of the offense under

Massachusetts law. Whindleton, 797 F.3d at 113 (“The statute can be understood as having

two elements: the attempted or threatened battery (simple assault) and the use of a

dangerous weapon.”) (citing Melton, 763 N.E.2d at 1096). The First Circuit determined

that the Massachusetts statute met the ACCA requirement of force because the statute

applied when the crime was accomplished “by means of,” i.e., through the use of, a

dangerous weapon. Id. at 113-14.

        Petitioner argues that the offense of terrorizing under 17-A M.R.S. § 210 is not an

ACCA violent felony under the force clause, because section 210 provides that an

evacuation is one of two alternate “natural and probable consequence(s)” that may be

proven, and the statute does not require that the evacuation itself occur under an additional

threat of violence. (Reply at 25.)



                                             16
Case 2:04-cr-00123-GZS Document 49 Filed 03/30/17 Page 17 of 18                           PageID #: 299



        Petitioner’s argument fails. “[A] threat to commit or to cause to be committed a

crime of violence to human life,” when committed with a dangerous weapon, meets the

ACCA force clause requirement, regardless of whether the conduct places “the person to

whom the threat is communicated or the person threatened in reasonable fear that the crime

will be committed,” under 17-A M.R.S. § 210(1)(A), or results in an “evacuation of a

building, place of assembly or facility of public transport,” under 17-A M.R.S. § 210(1)(B).

In other words, Petitioner’s conduct, rather than the consequence of the conduct, is the

relevant element on which the Court must focus to determine whether the offense

constitutes an ACCA violent felony. Thus, a conviction for terrorizing with a dangerous

weapon, regardless of whether it is under section 210(1)(A) or 210(1)(B), satisfies the

ACCA’s force clause requirement.

                                         III.    CONCLUSION

        Based on the foregoing analysis, Petitioner has at least three qualifying convictions

under ACCA. I recommend, therefore, that the Court deny Petitioner’s motion for habeas

relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. I further recommend that the Court grant a certificate of

appealability pursuant to Rule 11 of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Cases. 17




17
  Because the Court issued a certificate of appealability on the burglary issues raised in McCurdy, Dimott,
Collamore, Casey, it is appropriate to issue one here as well. The issues are (1) whether the retroactive
application of Johnson II permits re-examination of prior crimes that are predicates under the enumerated
crimes clause of 18 U.S.C. § 924(e); and (2) whether Mathis overrules Duquette. See McCurdy, 2017 WL
74695, at *5, 2017 U.S. Dist. Lexis 1947, at *14; Dimott, 2016 WL 6068114, at *4, 2016 U.S. Dist. Lexis
