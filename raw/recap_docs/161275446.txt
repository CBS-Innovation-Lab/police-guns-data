            RECOMMENDED DECISION ON 28 U.S.C. § 2255 MOTION

       Petitioner moves pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 to vacate, set aside or correct his

sentence. (Motion, ECF No. 211.) The Government asks the Court to dismiss the matter

because Petitioner filed the motion after the statute of limitations expired. (Response, ECF

No. 219.)

       Following a review of Petitioner’s section 2255 motion, the Government’s response,

and the record, I recommend the Court dismiss the motion.

                 FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

       In April 2015, the grand jury issued a superseding indictment against Petitioner for

conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base in

violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 846, 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(B), possession with intent to

distribute cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(B), possession

of a firearm by a felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2), and use of a

person under age eighteen in drug operations in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 861(a)(1).

(Superseding Indictment, ECF No. 68.) After an unsuccessful attempt to suppress certain
Case 2:15-cr-00010-DBH Document 225 Filed 02/19/21 Page 2 of 6              PageID #: 1179




evidence, Petitioner pled guilty to the conspiracy charge in February 2016. (Order Denying

Motion to Suppress, ECF No. 109; Change of Plea Hearing, ECF No. 135.)

       In July 2016, the Court sentenced Petitioner to 114 months in prison, to be followed

by five years of supervised release. (Judgment, ECF No. 170.) Petitioner appealed based

on the suppression order; the First Circuit affirmed in August 2017. United States v. Dent,

867 F.3d 37 (1st Cir. 2017). Petitioner filed his § 2255 motion in June 2020. (Motion,

ECF No. 211.)

                                       DISCUSSION

       Title 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f) provides:

       A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a motion under this section. The
       limitation period shall run from the latest of –

          (1) the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final;

          (2) the date on which the impediment to making a motion created by
          governmental action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United
          States is removed, if the movant was prevented from making a motion by
          such governmental action;

          (3) the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the
          Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme
          Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or

          (4) the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims
          presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due
          diligence.

When there are multiple claims at issue, “the period of limitation in 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f)

should be applied on a claim-by-claim basis.” Capozzi v. United States, 768 F.3d 32, 33

(1st Cir. 2014).

Case 2:15-cr-00010-DBH Document 225 Filed 02/19/21 Page 3 of 6                   PageID #: 1180




           Petitioner does not allege, nor does the record reflect, that the Government imposed

an impediment to a timely filing; Petitioner’s claim does not rely on a right newly-

recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral

review;1 and Petitioner does not allege newly-discovered facts in support of his section

2255 claims. Because paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) do not apply, therefore, the limitations

period began to run when Petitioner’s judgment of conviction became final.

           The Court entered Petitioner’s judgment of conviction on July 19, 2016. (Judgment,

ECF No. 170.) The First Circuit upheld the judgment on August 8, 2017. (United States

v. Dent, 867 F.3d 37, 38 (1st Cir. 2017). Petitioner then had ninety days to seek a writ of

certiorari from the United States Supreme Court. Sup. Ct. R. 13. Petitioner’s judgment

became final following the expiration of the ninety-day period on July 7, 2017.

See Clay v. United States, 537 U.S. 522, 532 (2003) (“We hold that, for federal criminal

defendants who do not file a petition for certiorari with this Court on direct review,

§ 2255’s one-year limitation period starts to run when the time for seeking such review

expires”). The limitation period for filing a section 2255 motion to challenge the judgment

expired one year later, on July 7, 2018. See Rogers v. United States, 180 F.3d 349, 355

n.13 (1st Cir. 1999) (“‘When a statute of limitations is measured in years, the last day for

instituting the action is the anniversary date of the start of the limitations period.’”) (quoting

Ross v. Artuz, 150 F.3d 97, 103 (2d Cir. 1998)). Petitioner filed his motion on June 15,

2020, nearly two years after the limitations period expired.

       Petitioner argues his filing was timely under § 2255(f)(3) as a result of the Supreme

Court’s June 21, 2019 decision in Rehaif v. United States, 139 S. Ct. 2191 (2019). Under

18 U.S.C. § 922(g), it is unlawful for certain persons, including individuals with prior

felony convictions, id. § 922(g)(1), to possess a firearm or ammunition. The statute

contains three elements: (1) a status element (belonging to one of the listed categories of

persons), (2) a possession element, and (3) a jurisdictional element (in or affecting

commerce). Rehaif, 139 S. Ct. at 2196. Before 2019, courts interpreted “knowingly” in

the penalty provision (§ 924(a)(2)) to apply only to the possession element, but under

Rehaif, “knowingly” also applies to the status element. Id. “To convict a defendant, the

Government therefore must show that the defendant knew he possessed a firearm and also

that he knew he had the relevant status when he possessed it.” Id. at 2194.

       The Rehaif decision applies retroactively to initial postconviction petitions, and the

uniform and longstanding authority that Rehaif reversed can provide cause to excuse a

petitioner’s failure to raise the issue earlier, see Brake v. United States, No. 2:13-CR-

00160-GZS, 2021 WL 388439, at *3–4, 10 (D. Me. Feb. 3, 2021); Macarthur v. United

States, No. 1:12-CR-00084-JAW, 2020 WL 7079134, at *11 (D. Me. Dec. 3, 2020). The

date of the Rehaif decision is irrelevant here, however, because Petitioner’s ground for

relief is not based on an asserted error related to a knowledge-of-status issue within §§

922(g) and 924(a). Petitioner was not convicted of an offense under §§ 922(g) and 924(a).

The felon-in-possession charge against Petitioner was dismissed when he plead guilty to

the drug distribution conspiracy charge. Petitioner challenges a guideline sentencing



                                             4
Case 2:15-cr-00010-DBH Document 225 Filed 02/19/21 Page 5 of 6                                PageID #: 1182




enhancement unrelated to the felon-in-possession statutes. For those reasons, Petitioner

does not assert a newly recognized right and Section 2255(f)(3) does not apply.2

        In sum, because Petitioner did not file the § 2255 motion within the applicable

limitation period, and because equitable tolling does not apply,3 dismissal is warranted.

                                                CONCLUSION

        Based on the foregoing analysis, I recommend that the Court dismiss Petitioner’s

motion for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. I further recommend that the Court deny

a certificate of appealability pursuant to Rule 11 of the Rules Governing Section 2255

Cases because there is no substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right within

the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).

                                                  NOTICE

               A party may file objections to those specified portions of a magistrate
        judge’s report or proposed findings or recommended decisions entered
        pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B) for which de novo review by the district
        court is sought, together with a supporting memorandum, within fourteen
        (14) days of being served with a copy thereof. A responsive memorandum
        shall be filed within fourteen (14) days after the filing of the objection.

  Petitioner appears to maintain that Rehaif established a principle that generally requires the Government
to prove a defendant knew of any relevant status in order for that status to have a legal consequence.
Petitioner appears to extend that argument not only to statutes in addition to the felon-in-possession statutes,
but also to the advisory sentencing guidelines. Petitioner’s argument suggests that the guideline
enhancement for employing a minor in the drug distribution scheme required the Government to prove that
Petitioner knew that the individual was under the age of eighteen when Petitioner employed that individual
to distribute controlled substances. Petitioner’s argument fails in that it would extend Rehaif well beyond
its scope, which involved the statutory interpretation of the specific language in §§ 922(g) and 924(a).

  “[T]he AEDPA statute of limitations defense is not jurisdictional” and “is subject to equitable tolling in
appropriate cases.” Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, 645 (2010) (internal quotations omitted). “To obtain
tolling . . . a petitioner bears a substantial burden to establish . . . that he exercised reasonable diligence in
trying to preserve his rights but was prevented from timely filing by extraordinary circumstances.”
Dominguez v. Duval, 527 F. App’x 38, 40 (1st Cir. 2013); see also Trapp v. Spencer, 479 F.3d 53, 61 (1st
Cir. 2007) (discussing illustrative cases). “The diligence prong covers those affairs within the petitioner’s
control, while the extraordinary-circumstances prong covers matters outside his control.” Blue v. Medeiros,
913 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2019). Petitioner does not allege any circumstances warranting equitable tolling.

             Failure to file a timely objection shall constitute a waiver of the right
      to de novo review by the district court and to appeal the district court’s order.
