                         ORDER AFFIRMING THE
              RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE


       The United States Magistrate Judge filed with the Court on July 6, 2012, her Recommended

Decision (ECF No. 175). Movant filed his Objection to the Recommended Decision (ECF No. 176)

on July 30, 2012.

       I have reviewed and considered the Magistrate Judge's Recommended Decision, together

with the entire record; I have made a de novo determination of all matters adjudicated by the

Magistrate Judge's Recommended Decision; and I concur with the recommendations of the United

States Magistrate Judge for the reasons set forth in her Recommended Decision, and determine that

no further proceeding is necessary.

       1.      It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the Magistrate Judge
               is hereby AFFIRMED.

       3.     It is ORDERED that no certificate of appealability shall issue in the event Movant
