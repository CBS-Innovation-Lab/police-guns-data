                   UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                         DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO


 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
  Plaintiff,
                                                          Criminal No. 99-044 (HL)
 v.

 CARLOS O. DIAZ-DIAZ [3],
  Defendant.



                                           ORDER

        Before the Court is petitioner Carlos O. Diaz-Diaz’s “Motion to Vacate, Set Aside or
Correct Criminal Sentence” (docket no. 813) made pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255. In this two
paragraph motion, assisted by counsel, petitioner requests that the Court vacate his criminal
sentence pursuant to Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (2004), and Dodd
v. United States, 125 S.Ct. 2478 (2005). The Court hereby denies said motion for three
reasons.
        First, the present motion is devoid of any facts or argument. A motion to vacate, set
aside, or correct sentence must, inter alia, “(1) specify all the grounds for relief available to
the moving party; (2) state the facts supporting each ground; [and] (3) state the relief
requested.” Rule 2(b) of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings for the United States
District Courts. Petitioner has failed to specify any grounds for relief or to state any facts
supporting relief. See id.
        Second, petitioner does not appear to have a viable claim which can be asserted under
29 U.S.C. § 2255. It is well settled that, if a “sentence was imposed consistent with then-
prevailing law and that sentence is not otherwise subject to collateral attack, the prisoner has
no claim to bring under section 2255.” See Sepulveda v. United States, 330 F.3d 55, 65 (1st
Cir.2003). The rights newly recognized to the United States Supreme Court in Blakely v.
Washington and United States v. Booker, 125 S.Ct. 738 (2005), are not retroactively applicable

to cases on collateral review. See Cirilo-Muñoz v. United States, 404 F.3d 527, 532-33 (1st
Cir.2005); United States v. Fraser, 407 F.3d 9, 11 (1st Cir.2005). The Court of Appeals for
the First Circuit has held that petitions under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 are not available to advance
Blakely or Booker claims in the absence of a Supreme Court decision rendering these decisions
retroactive. See Cirilo-Muñoz, 404 F.3d at 532-33; Fraser, 407 F.3d at 11. Cf. Sepulveda v.
United States, 330 F.3d 55, 63 (1st Cir.2003) (holding that Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S.
466, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (2000), applies only on direct appeal and not on § 2255 motion).
       Finally, petitioner’s motion is time-barred. Section 2255 provides a one-year period
of limitation for filing motions under the section. See 28 U.S.C. § 2255 at ¶6. In relevant
part, the limitation period runs from the latest of “the date on which the judgment of
conviction becomes final” or “the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by
the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made
retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.” Id. at ¶6(1), (3) (emphasis ours). In
the instant case, judgment was entered on September 5, 2003. (See docket no. 750). Petitioner
never appealed this judgment. Thus, more than one-year elapsed between the date on which
petitioner’s judgment of conviction became final and July 23, 2005, the date that petitioner
filed his section 2255 motion. See Fed.R.App.P. 4(b). Further, petitioner specifically asserts
his motion pursuant to Blakely v. Washington, which, as discussed above, has not been made
retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. See Cirilo-Muñoz, 404 F.3d at 532-33;
Fraser, 407 F.3d at 11.
       For the aforementioned reasons, petitioner Carlos O. Diaz-Diaz’s motion to vacate, set
aside, or correct criminal sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 is hereby DENIED.



       IT IS SO ORDERED.
