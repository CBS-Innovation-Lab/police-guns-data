    THE GOVERNMENT'S MOTION FOR AN ORDER OF EXCLUDABLE DELAY
                          (Assented to)

     The United States of America, by Michael J. Sullivan, United

States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, respectfully

moves for an order of excludable delay under the Speedy Trial

Act, 18 U.S.C. §3161.       The Defendant has assented to this motion

to exclude the time from July 18, 2005, through November 14,

2005.

     In support of this motion the government states that on July

18, 2005 this Court scheduled the Defendant’s trial for November

14, 2005.    This was the first available trial date when taking

into consideration the respective schedules of counsel, the

undersigned U.S. Attorney, and the Court.         The Court indicated it

would accommodate the Defendant’s request for an earlier trial

date, but the Defendant through his counsel requested the

November date.    The time should be excluded for reasons of

continuity of counsel and in the best interests of justice.

     It is in the best interests of the Defendant, the

government, and the public, to exclude the time from July 18,

2005, until November 14, 2005, from the period within which the

trial of this case must commence under the Speedy Trial Act.

                                       Respectfully submitted,

                                       MICHAEL J. SULLIVAN
