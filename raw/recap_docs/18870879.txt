                   UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                                      Case No. 07-cr-45-PB

John Douglas



                               O R D E R

     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

August 19, 2008 trial in the above case, citing the need for

additional time to consider the results of the competency

evaluation recently completed and prepare a defense or negotiate

a plea agreement.   The government does not object to a

continuance of the trial.

     Accordingly, for the above reason and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from August 19, 2008 to November 4, 2008.          In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
