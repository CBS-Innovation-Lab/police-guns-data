 ORDER AFFIRMING RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE


      On January 3, 2011, the United States Magistrate Judge filed with the
court, with copies to counsel, his Recommended Decision on Motions to
Suppress. The defendant filed his objection to the Recommended Decision on
April 8, 2011.   I have reviewed and considered the Recommended Decision,
together with the entire record; I have made a de novo determination of all
matters adjudicated by the Recommended Decision; and I concur with the
recommendations of the United States Magistrate Judge for the reasons set
forth in the Recommended Decision, and determine that no further proceeding
is necessary.
      It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the Magistrate
Judge is hereby ADOPTED. The defendantâ€™s motions to suppress are DENIED.

      SO ORDERED.

      DATED THIS 26TH DAY OF APRIL, 2011
