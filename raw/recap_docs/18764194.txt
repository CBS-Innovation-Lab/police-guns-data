                     UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                           DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

              v.                                  Criminal No. 05-cr-138-01-PB

Jamison Mims



       The defendant has moved to continue the February 7, 2006 trial in the above

case. Defendant cites the need for additional time to complete efforts to negotiate a

non-trial disposition or otherwise prepare for a trial or other disposition of this case. The

government does not object to a continuance of the trial date.

       Accordingly, in order to allow the parties additional time to negotiate a non-trial

disposition, or properly prepare for trial, or other disposition, the court will continue the

trial from February 7, 2006 to April 4, 2006. In agreeing to continue the trial, the court

finds pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the best interests of the public

and the defendant in a speedy trial.
