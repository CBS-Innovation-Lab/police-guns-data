                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 09-cr-167-PB

Charles A. Allen, III

                                   O R D E R


     The defendant has moved, through counsel, to continue the

trial scheduled for December 1, 2009 for a period of 60 days to

allow time to engage in plea negotiations and to resolve a

pending supervised release issue in case no. 99-cr-001-JD.               The

government does not object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reasons and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from December 1, 2009 to February 2, 2010.              In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(7)(A) that for the above-stated reason, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
