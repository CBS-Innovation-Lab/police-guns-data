                                 REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
10
            Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Count IV of the Indictment (Docket No. 526) must be granted
11
     without prejudice on ex post facto grounds pursuant to the First Circuit’s opinion on appeal. See
12
     United States v. Vega Molina, 407 F. 3d 511, 524-526 (1st Cir. 2005), pet. for cert. filed on August
13
     16, 2005. In its opinion, the Court of Appeals held that the penalty provision at issue — 18 U.S.C.
14
     § 1203(a) — was inexistent at the time defendant committed the offense.
15
            Notwithstanding this ruling, the Government may move to amend the indictment to charge
16
     a Section 371 conspiracy or a direct violation of Section 1203. See Vega Molina, supra at 526.
17
     More so, as the Circuit recognized, “the appellant’[s] inattentiveness [in not raising the issue until
18
     direct appeal] should not redowned to [his] benefit”.
19
            The Court RECOMMENDS that the Government be given twenty (20) days to decide
20
     whether to correct the indictment in regards to Count IV.
21
            The Government’s reply (Docket No. 528) and defendants’ response (Docket No. 529) have
22
     been duly NOTED and considered by the Court.
23
            Under the provisions of Rule 72(d), Local Rules, District of Puerto Rico, any party who
24
     objects to this report and recommendation must file a written objection thereto with the Clerk of the
25
     Court within ten (10) days of the party’s receipt of this report and recommendation. The written
26
     objections must specifically identify the portion of the recommendation, or report to which objection
27
     is made and the basis for such objections. Failure to comply with this rule precludes further
