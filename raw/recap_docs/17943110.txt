JOHN THOMAS HINES                       )


              ORDER ON DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS


      On May 9, 2014, based on intervening Supreme Court and First Circuit

authority, the Court vacated the conviction of John Thomas Hines, but refused to

dismiss the indictment. Order on Def.’s Mot. to Vacate and Dismiss (ECF No. 116).

On July 16, 2014, Mr. Hines moved again to dismiss the indictment, noting that two

district judges in the District of Maine had dismissed indictments in similar

circumstances. Def.’s Mot. to Dismiss (ECF No. 131). The Government opposes the

motion to dismiss, preferring to wait for the resolution of an appeal pending in the

First Circuit Court of Appeals, which should resolve whether the Government may

proceed in this case. Resp. of United States of America to Def.’s Third Mot. to Dismiss

the Indictment (ECF No. 133).

      The Court concludes that the wiser course is to wait for the First Circuit.

According to the Government, the appeals in United States v. Armstrong, No. 12-

1216, and United States v. Voisine, No. 12-1216, were scheduled to be argued on

September 8, 2014. Id. at 1. There is no timetable for the Court of Appeals to decide

these cases; however, a decision by the appellate court must be in the offing. The

potential prejudice to the Government, if it prevails on appeal, will be significant
because it will be required to present this case again to the grand jury and obtain an

indictment. Although the Court is concerned about Mr. Hines living in the shadow

not only of an indictment, but also of bail conditions while these legal issues are

resolved, the Court sought to minimize his conditions of release to those acceptable

to him.

      Balancing the Government’s and the Defendant’s rights, the Court strikes a

middle ground and will not dismiss the indictment until the First Circuit has spoken.

With this said, the Court dismisses Mr. Hine’ motion to dismiss without prejudice. If

the First Circuit rules against the Government in Armstrong and Voisine, the Court

expects that Mr. Hines will promptly file a renewed motion to dismiss.

      The Court DISMISSES without prejudice Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss (ECF

No. 131).

      SO ORDERED.
