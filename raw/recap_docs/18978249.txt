                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                        DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

             v.                           Criminal No. 11-cr-43-01-JL

James Spaulding


                                  O R D E R


        The assented to motion to reschedule jury trial (document no.

13 ) filed by defendant is granted in part.             The continuance is

limited to 60 days.        No further continuances without a hearing.

Final Pretrial is rescheduled to August 25, 2011 at 2:30; Trial is

continued to the two-week period beginning September 7, 2011,

09:30.

        Defendant shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights within 10

days.    The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting

a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv), for the

reasons set forth in the motion.

        SO ORDERED.
