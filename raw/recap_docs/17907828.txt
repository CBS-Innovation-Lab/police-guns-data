               ORDER ON DEFENDANT’S PENDING MOTIONS



      On May 22, 2014, the defendant Theodore Thomes filed an Opposition to

Co-Defendant’s Motion to Continue; Motion to Sever Defendants for Trial

Purposes; A Final Alternative to Reopen Detention Proceedings in this Matter.

(ECF No. 79). I treat this filing also as an objection to Magistrate Judge Rich’s

Speedy Trial Order of May 19, 2014, granting the co-defendant Renee Thomes’s

motion for continuance from the June trial list.        On May 29, 2014, the

government filed its response to the Opposition/Objection (ECF No. 83) and the

co-defendant Renee Thomes filed her own motion to sever (ECF No. 81).            I

OVERRULE the Opposition/Objection to the continuance from the June trial list

that Judge Rich granted, because it is necessary that I consider the merits of the

co-defendant Renee Thomes’s motion to sever before I can determine whether

this defendant should proceed to trial earlier and alone.      (This defendant’s

alternative motion to sever is based solely upon his expressed desire to avoid
delay, rather than upon concerns about the nature of a joint trial.) The co-

defendant Renee Thomes’s May 29, 2014, filing of a motion to sever stops the

Speedy Trial Clock regardless. United States v. Casas, 425 F.3d 23, 31 (1st Cir.

2005). The defendant’s own filing on May 22, 2014, probably stopped the clock

as well.

      I DEFER ruling on the defendant Theodore Thomes’s concurrent motion to

sever until his co-defendant’s motion to sever is fully briefed.

      The motion to reopen detention proceedings is DENIED for the reasons that

Judge Rich stated in denying that same motion on April 15, 2014.

      SO ORDERED.

      DATED THIS 30TH DAY OF MAY, 2014
