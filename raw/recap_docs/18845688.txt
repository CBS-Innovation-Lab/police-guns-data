Richard Ellison



                                      ORDER

     Re: Document No. 19, Motion for Subpoena for Suppression
Hearing/Trial

     Ruling: Denied.    Under the provisions of L. Cr. R. 17.1(a)
up to five subpoenas are available to appointed counsel for the
asking. More than five requires prior court approval. While the
line might be drawn in different places, the rule recognizes that
appointed counselâ€™s judgment, as officers of the court,         can
generally be relied upon and the public expense associated with
issuing and serving subpoenas, as well as the inconvenience imposed
upon those subject to issued subpoenas, will by and large be
warranted. Beyond five, however, the court must be satisfied that
the costs and impositions are actually warranted and counsel must
justify the additional expense and inconvenience to those whose
personal appearance is desired.     The motion for eight subpoenas
makes no effort at all to justify the need for more that five.
Counsel has been provided with the five permitted by rule, and the
balance is denied for failure to offer any explanation or
justification for the additional three.
