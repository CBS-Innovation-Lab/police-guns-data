UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND

UNITED STATES
v. Cr. No. 05-074-T
C.A. NO. 08-O40-T
WILLIAM J. BENNETT
MEMORANDUM AND ORDER DENYING SECTION 2255 MOTION
Ernest C. Torres, Senior United States District Judge.

William J. Bennett has filed a pro se motion to Vacate, set
aside or correct sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255. For the
reasons that follow, that motion is denied.

Background

Bennett pled guilty to a one~count indictment charging him
with being a felon in possession of a firearm, in Violation of 18
U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). Bennett’s plea agreement stated: (l) that if
the Court determined him to be an.Armed Career Criminal pursuant to
18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1), he would face a minimum sentence of 15 years
imprisonment and a maximum of life imprisonment but that,
otherwise, the maximum term of imprisonment would be 10 years
imprisonment (Plea Agreement q 5); and (2) that the Court was not
bound by the Government's recommendations and was free to impose
any' sentence it deemed. appropriate, up to and including the
statutory maximum. (ld. Ill). During the plea colloquy, Bennett
confirmed that he had read the Plea Agreement; that he had

discussed it with his counsel; that he understood it; and that he

voluntarily signed it. (ld. II 15, 16). After the AUSA explained
that parties disagreed as to whether Bennett's criminal record made

him an armed career criminal, this Court questioned Bennett as

follows:
Q. Also, do you understand, as Mr. Chafee earlier said, and
as is set forth in your plea agreement, you understand that if
your guilty plea is accepted -- well, first of all, as Mr.

Chafee indicated, there's going to be some disagreement here
between the United States Attorney and Mr. Fitzgerald as to
what guideline range applies in your case, whether you do have
enough previous convictions to classify you as an armed career
criminal or not, and that will make a difference in your
guideline range. Do you understand that?

A. Yes, your Honor.

Q. But do you also understand that if your guilty plea is
accepted, you could receive a sentence of at least 15 years
and up to life in prison if you're found to be an armed career
criminal, and followed by a period of supervised release of at
least five years and up to life, a fine of $250,000 and a
special assessment of at least $100. And if you're not an
armed career criminal, if you're not found to be an armed
career criminal, then your sentence would be -- could be up to
10 years in prison followed by up to three years of supervised
release, a fine up to $250,000, and a special assessment of
$100. You understand that?

A. Yes, your Honor.

(Plea Tr. at 13-14). (Emphasis added)

The presentence report (PSR) prepared by the U.S. Probation
Office showed that Bennett had three prior convictions for crimes
of violence, which made him an armed career criminal under 18
U.S.C. § 924(e) and elevated his guideline range from 24-30 months
to 135-168 months. (PSR 11 22).

Bennett objected to the armed.career criminal designation, and

Case 1:05-cr-00074-|\/|-LDA Document 33 Filed 03/16/09 Page 3 of 5 Page|D #: 151

his counsel filed two memoranda arguing that Bennett’s prior state
conviction for breaking and entering a storage shed in violation of
R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-8-5 (Dkt. No. W2/94-0326A) did not qualify as
a crime of violence. At the sentencing hearing, counsel pressed
that objection but this Court found that the offense was a crime of
violence. Consequently, this Court imposed the mandatory minimum
sentence of 15 years. (Sentencing Tr. 14-19)

Bennett's challenge to that finding was rejected by the Court
of Appeals which affirmed Bennett's conviction and sentence. gee
United States v. Bennett, 469 F.3d 46 (1st Cir. 2006).

In his Section 2255 motion, Bennett claims that his counsel
provided ineffective assistance by: (1) permitting Bennett “to
enter into a Plea Agreement that failed to establish by agreement
whether [he] was an armed career criminal;” and (2) advising
Bennett to plead based on an erroneous estimate of the potential

sentence he might receive.l

 

l

Bennett has requested an evidentiary hearing on his claims.
However, no hearing is required in connection with any issues
raised by his motion to vacate, because, as discussed infra, the
files and records of this case conclusively establish that the
claims in the motion to vacate are without merit. §§§ David v.
United States, 134 F.3d 470, 477 (1st Cir. 1998) (district court
properly may forego any hearing “when (1) the motion is inadequate
on its face, or (2) the movant's allegations, even if true, do not
entitle him to relief, or (3) the movant's allegations ‘need not be
accepted as true because they state conclusions instead of facts,
contradict the record, or are inherently incredible.'") (citation
omitted). See also Panzardi-Alvarez v. United States, 879 F.2d
975, 985 n.8 (1st Cir. 1989) (no hearing is required where the
district judge is thoroughly familiar with the case). Thus, his

Analysis

A defendant who claims that he was deprived of his Sixth
Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel must
demonstrate: (1) “that counsel's performance fell below an
objective standard of reasonableness;” and (2) “a reasonable
probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the
result of the proceeding would have been different.” Strickland v.
Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064-65,
2068, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).

Bennett’s claim rests on the assertion that he was not
informed. that he faced. the possibility' of a 15 year minimum
sentence and that, if he knew that, he would. not have pled.
However, that assertion is flatly contradicted by the record.

Bennett's plea agreement clearly provides that, if classified
as an armed career criminal, he would be subject to a minimum
sentence of 15 years. (Plea .Agreement IB). Furthermore, the
possibility of a 15 year mandatory minimum was specifically
explained to Bennett at the change of plea hearing, and Bennett
stated that he understood.

Nor can Bennett's counsel be faulted for failing to persuade
the Court that Bennett was not an armed career criminal. Counsel
submitted two thoughtful memoranda on the subject and, at the

sentencing hearing, ably argued that Bennett’s burglary conviction

 

request for hearing will be denied.

did not qualify as a predicate offense.

Conclusion

For all of the foregoing reasons, Bennett’s motion to vacate

under Section 2255 is hereby DENIED and dismissed.

SO ORDERED:
