                        DEFENDANT        )


                    ORDER ON DEFENDANT’S MOTIONS


      The motions to alter or modify sentence are DENIED. I have no authority

to alter a sentence once imposed, as Mr. Small has requested. However, at my

request this District’s Probation Office has contacted Mr. Small’s case manager

at BOP and I understand that part of what Mr. Small desires may be

accomplished through his assignment to a halfway house in Maine before

Christmas.

      The motion for sentencing transcripts is also DENIED, as there is no need

for a transcript in the absence of a motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.

      SO ORDERED.

      DATED THIS 4TH DAY OF SEPTEMBER, 2014

                                             /S/D. BROCK HORNBY
