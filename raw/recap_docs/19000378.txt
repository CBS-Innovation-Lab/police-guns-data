                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 12-cr-17-PB

Derek Kucinski



                                  O R D E R


     The defendant has moved through counsel to continue the

April 3, 2012 trial in the above case, citing the need for

additional time to consider plea negotiations or prepare a

defense.     The government does not object to a continuance of the

trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reasons and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from April 3, 2012 to June 5, 2012.             In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ' 3161(h)(7)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy

trial.
