                                              ORDER OF DETENTION PENDING TRIAL


         In accordance with the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C., Section 3142(f), a detention hearing
has been held. I conclude that the following facts require the detention of the defendant pending
trial in this case.

                                                      Part I - Findings of Fact

              []            (1)     The defendant is charged with an offense described in 18 U.S.C. Section
                            3142(f)(1) and has been convicted of a (federal offense)(state of local offense that
                            would have been a federal offense if a circumstance giving rise to federal
                            jurisdiction had existed) that is

                            [ ] a crime of violence as defined in 18 U.S.C. Section 3156(a)(4).
                            [ ] an offense for which the maximum sentence is life imprisonment or death.
                            [ ] an offense for which the maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is
                            prescribed in ____________________________________________________.
                            [ ] a felony that was committed after the defendant had been convicted of two or
                            more prior federal offenses described in 18 U.S.C. Section 3142(f)(1)(A)-(C), or
                            comparable state or local offenses.
              []            (2)      The offense described in finding (1) was committed while the defendant
                            was on release pending trial for a federal, state or local offense.
              []            (3)      A period of not more than five years has elapsed since the (date of
                            conviction)(release of the defendant from imprisonment) for the offense described
                            in finding (1).
              []            (4)      Findings Nos. (1)(2) and (3) establish a rebuttable presumption that no
                            condition or combination or combinations of conditions will reasonably assure the
                            safety of (an) other person(s) and the community. I further find that the defendant
                            has not rebutted this presumption.




                                                                  1

                                       Alternate Findings (A)
       []      (1)       There is probable cause to believe that the defendant has committed an
               offense
                              []      for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or
                       more is prescribed in the Controlled Substances Act.
                              []      under 18 U.S.C. Section 924(c).
       []      (2)     The defendant has not rebutted the presumption established by finding 1 that
               no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of
               the defendant as required and the safety of the community.

                                      Alternate Findings (B)
       [X]     (1)    There is a serious risk that the defendant will not appear.
       [X]     (2)    There is a serious risk that the defendant will endanger the safety of another
               person or the community.

                     Part II - Written Statement of Reasons for Detention

         The defendant has been charged by complaint with being a felon in possession of a firearm
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). Four felony convictions are alleged in the complaint. All
appear to be “crimes of violence,” as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 3156(a)(4), and “violent felonies”
within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 924(e). The government seeks the detention of the defendant as
a risk of flight and a danger to the community.

         The evidence against the defendant is strong. There is substantial circumstantial evidence
that late at night on April 26th he and an associate committed a violent, armed invasion of the
residence and bedroom therein of Mark Luxton in Buxton, Maine, during which shots were fired at
Luxton. The defendant’s DNA was found on several pieces of evidence in the Luxton residence
related to the home invasion, including on a metal fragment believed to be part of a spent bullet
and on a portion of a latex glove. His DNA was also found on a beer bottle and napkin found
behind the Free Will Baptist Church located approximately 100 yards from the Luxton residence.
Other physical evidence found in the Luxton home is in the process of being tested. There is also
evidence indicating that the defendant has been threatening and tormenting Luxton for at least a few
years in retaliation for Luxton’s cooperation with the state in one of its prior felony prosecutions
against the defendant.

        The defendant is 22 years old and has lived in southern Maine his whole life. His mother
and sister live together in Biddeford. His father resides in Gorham. The defendant is single and
has no dependants. He does not have a fixed residence and is unemployed.

       The defendant has a long history of substance abuse. He claims that he has been drug and
alcohol free for a year and a half until recently suffering a relapse with the use of alcohol.
Although the defendant has been involved in a long-term substance abuse rehabilitation program at
Serenity House, the director of Serenity House reports that he would not be allowed back in the
program because of the present circumstances.




                                                  2
 Case 2:06-cr-00052-DBH Document 10 Filed 06/12/06 Page 3 of 3                       PageID #: 26



        The defendant also has a lengthy and troublesome adult criminal history despite the fact
that he has been an adult for only four years. He has ten felony convictions, including seven for
burglary, a crime of violence. He also has three state probation revocations and a fourth now
pending arising from the home invasion. One of his felony convictions is for violating conditions
of release. The instant offense was committed while on state probation. On the instant charge he
faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years with a Guidelines range of 262 to 327 months.

       Although the defendant contested the government’s motion for detention, he offered no
argument at the close of the evidence and did not propose any conditions of release or even an
appropriate residential placement.

        On the basis of the foregoing, I find by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant
poses a serious risk of non-appearance and that there are no available conditions of release that
will reasonably assure his appearance as required. I also find, by clear and convincing evidence,
that the defendant poses a serious risk of danger to the safety of the community if released and that
there are no conditions of release that will reasonably assure community safety. I therefore
ORDER that the defendant be detained pending trial.

                            Part III - Directions Regarding Detention

        The defendant is committed to the custody of the Attorney General or his designated
representative for confinement in a corrections facility separate, to the extend possible, from
persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody pending appeal. The defendant
shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity for private consultation with defense counsel. On order
of a court of the United States or on request of an attorney for the government, the person in charge
of the corrections facility shall deliver the defendant to the United States Marshal for the purpose
of an appearance in connection with a court proceeding.
