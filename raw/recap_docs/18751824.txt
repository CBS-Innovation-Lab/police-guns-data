                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                        DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE

United States of America

      v.                                   Criminal No. 04-cr-192-JD

Bruce Belton


                               PROCEDURAL ORDER

      The court met with counsel on October 4, 2005, to discuss

the scheduling of this case.          The defendant had not yet returned

to the state of New Hampshire following his hospitalization.

Defense counsel indicated that he expects that the defendant

would be returning soon and that he wanted the opportunity to

meet with the defendant to review his case.

      Therefore, in the interest of justice, the trial of this

matter is rescheduled to December 6, 2005.

      Defense counselâ€™s motion to allow a day off during the trial

that was originally scheduled for November (document no. 29) is

moot.

      SO ORDERED.
