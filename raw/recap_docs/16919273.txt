                                     SENTENCING ORDER

       On September 8, 2004, a jury found Defendant Daniel Ralph Bishop guilty of being a

felon in possession of a firearm, a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). Scheduled to be sentenced

on May 9, 2005, Mr. Bishop has raised three legal issues: 1) whether his 1978 conviction for

burglary is a violent felony; 2) whether his 1991 conviction for possession of an unregistered

firearm is a violent felony; and, 3) whether he should be entitled to a two-level reduction for

acceptance of responsibility.    This Court concludes that Mr. Bishop’s 1978 conviction for

burglary and his 1991 conviction for possession of an unregistered firearm are violent felonies

within the meaning of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), and that,

because he went to trial and failed to convince a jury that his possession of the firearms was

justified, he is not entitled to a two-level reduction under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(a).

I. DISCUSSION

       A. Whether his 1978 Conviction for Burglary is a Violent Felony

       Mr. Bishop was convicted on October 5, 1978 in Piscataquis County Superior Court in

the State of Maine of a July 25, 1978 burglary at Berg’s General Store. He was sentenced to

eighteen months in the Maine Correctional Center. Mr. Bishop argues this conviction should not

count as a “violent felony” under the ACCA. See 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B). Mr. Bishop
Case 1:04-cr-00024-JAW Document 55 Filed 04/22/05 Page 2 of 6                                      PageID #: 162



concedes his 1978 burglary conviction would constitute a predicate felony for ACCA purposes if

he committed the crime as a principal.1 See United States v. Fiore, 983 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1992).

However, he questions whether the ACCA definition of “violent felony” applies if he had been

found guilty of the burglary only as an accomplice.

         Mr. Bishop’s argument tracks the logic of Shepard v. United States, __ U.S. __, 125 S.

Ct. 1254 (2005): if the statute allows for both predicate and non-predicate felonies, and if court

documents fail to clarify the facts underlying the crime, the court cannot engage in fact-finding

without running afoul of the Sixth Amendment. Id. at 1262. Here, Mr. Bishop contends that,

because Maine law permits accomplice liability without requiring an overt act, he may have been

convicted of being an accomplice, which he argues would not constitute a predicate felony. Mr.

Bishop, however, is incorrect.

         First, in examining the indictment and the judgment, as permitted by Shepard, there is no

evidence Mr. Bishop was charged and pleaded guilty as an accomplice, and not as a principal. 2

Mr. Bishop’s contention that he was only an accomplice is not substantiated by the court

documents, and under Shepard, this Court cannot look beyond “the statutory definition, charging

document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by

the trial judge to which the defendant assented.” Id. at 1257. A federal sentencing court “may

not hold a mini-trial on the particular facts underlying the prior offense in an effort to determine


1
  This Court has already made this determination. See United States v. Bishop, 350 F. Supp. 2d 127, 130-32 (D. Me.
2004). In reviewing Bishop, this Court painted with too broad a brush when it stated that in Taylor v. United States,
495 U.S. 575 (1990), the Supreme Court “recognized that Congress included all types of burglaries as predicate
offenses of the ACCA because every burglary inherently presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to
another.” Bishop, 350 F. Supp. 2d at 132. As Shepard v. United States, __ U.S. __, 125 S. Ct. 1254, 1257 (2005),
made clear, this statement is true only as to generic burglaries, not to other types of burglaries, such as the burglary
of a motor vehicle or boat.
2
  The indictment charges that “DANIEL R. BISHOP did enter in a structure, to wit, Berg’s General Store, of the
property of Ralph Berg, knowing that he was not licensed or privileged to do so, with the intent to commit theft
therein.” The judgment reflects that Mr. Bishop pleaded guilty to burglary. There is no mention of accomplice
liability.

whether the defendant’s conduct was violent.” United States v. Dueno, 171 F.3d 3, 5 (1st Cir.

1999); see also United States v. Damon, 127 F.3d 139, 144 (1st Cir. 1997).

       Second, Mr. Bishop’s description of accomplice liability in Maine, though correct as far

as it goes, does not tell the whole story. It is true, as he states, that Maine law does not require an

“overt act of assistance or actual physical participation in the commission of the crime.” State v.

Pheng, 2002 ME 40, ¶ 9, 791 A.2d 925, 928. However, Maine law does require more than

“mere presence at the scene”; it requires proof of “any conduct promoting or facilitating,

however slightly, the commission of the crime.” Id. ¶ 9, 791 A.2d at 927. Pheng itself states

that accomplice liability may attach if “a person, intending that a crime be committed, aids by

actively furnishing advice and encouragement.” Id. ¶ 9, 791 A.2d at 927-28. Thus, for example,

a person who drives an automobile to the scene of a burglary may be convicted of burglary, even

though another actually entered the building. State v. Bradley, 414 A.2d 1236 (Me. 1980).

       Finally, the First Circuit quickly dispatched a similar argument in United States v.

Mitchell, 23 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1994). Mitchell states that “aiding and abetting ‘is not a separate

offense’ from the underlying substantive crime.” Id. at 2 (quoting United States v. Sanchez, 917

F.2d 607, 611 (1st Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 977 (1991)). Mitchell held that “aiding and

abetting the commission of a crime of violence is a crime of violence itself.” Id. at 3.

       This Court concludes Mr. Bishop’s 1978 conviction for burglary constitutes a “violent

felony” under § 924(e) and U.S.S.G. § 4B1.4. See § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)(the term “violent felony”

includes burglary); Bishop, 350 F. Supp. 2d at 130-32.

       B. Whether his 1991 Conviction for Possession of an Unregistered Firearm
       Constitutes a Violent Felony

       On October 23, 1990, Mr. Bishop was indicted by a Grand Jury in the United States

District Court for knowing possession of “a loaded . . . 12 gauge shotgun . . . with a barrel length



                                                  3
Case 1:04-cr-00024-JAW Document 55 Filed 04/22/05 Page 4 of 6                                PageID #: 164



of approximately 14 ¾ inches and with an overall length of approximately 24 ¼ inches, not

registered to him in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.” On April 12,

1991, Mr. Bishop pleaded guilty to a violation of 25 U.S.C. § 5861(d), possession of an

unregistered firearm, and was sentenced to thirty months incarceration.

        The First Circuit has held that “possession of a sawed-off shotgun is a ‘violent felony’

within the meaning of ACCA.” United States v. Fortes, 141 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1998), cert.

denied, 524 U.S. 961 (1998). Undeterred, Mr. Bishop argues that Fortes is not good law

because: (1) the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial requires that the jury, and not the court,

determine whether his conviction for possession of an unregistered firearm constitutes a “violent

felony”; (2) the Ninth Circuit, upon which Fortes relied, has not “followed its own logic”; and,

(3) United States v. Doe, 960 F.2d 221 (1st Cir. 1992), is more persuasive. This Court disagrees.

Fortes remains the “law of the circuit,” and this Court, as a lower court, is required to apply it.

See United States v. Chhien, 266 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1150 (2002).

There is no indication the First Circuit is going to revise its holding in Fortes. See Dueno, 171 F.

3d at 4 (citing Fortes with approval). But, if Fortes is to be changed, it is for the First Circuit,

not this Court, to change it. Under Fortes, Mr. Bishop’s 1991 conviction for possession of an

unregistered firearm constitutes a “violent felony” within the meaning of the ACC.

        C. Whether Mr. Bishop Should be Accorded a Two-Point Reduction Under
           U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1 for Acceptance of Responsibility

        Mr. Bishop’s final argument is that he should be accorded a two-point reduction for

acceptance of responsibility under Guideline § 3E1.1. 3 Mr. Bishop did not plead guilty to this

crime. Instead, he proceeded to trial and was convicted by a jury on September 8, 2004. Mr.

Bishop bears the burden to establish his entitlement to a reduction for acceptance. United States

3
  Mr. Bishop’s argument is confined to the two -level reduction under Guideline § 3E1.1(a). He makes no argument
that he is entitled to the additional one-level reduction under Guideline § 3E1.1(b).

v. Baltas, 236 F.3d 27, 37 (1st Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 1030 (2001). If the defendant

put the government to its proof at trial, the Guidelines provide the reduction is to be allowed only

in “rare situations,” where a defendant can “clearly demonstrate an acceptance of responsibility

for his criminal conduct even though he exercises his constitutional right to a trial.” U.S.S.G. §

3E1.1, Application Note 2.

       Nevertheless, Mr. Bishop points out that the Commentary does not preclude a defendant

who goes to trial from receiving an acceptance reduction, and he contends he did not “challenge

the factual elements of guilt.” Def.’s Sentencing Mem. (Docket # 53) at 5. He says at trial he

only argued the statute should not be applied to him “because of the doctrine of necessity.” Id.

To deny the reduction, he argues, would impermissibly penalize him “for asserting his

constitutional right to trial.” Id. (quoting United States v. Fells, 78 F.3d 168, 172 (5th Cir. 1996),

cert. denied, 519 U.S. 847 (1996)).

       Although Mr. Bishop asserted a necessity defense, he failed to convince the jury. In

circumstances of this sort, as the First Circuit recently reiterated, “binding circuit precedent

precludes a decrease.” United States v. Gorsuch, No. 03-2337, 2005 WL 895209, at *2 (1st Cir.

Apr. 19, 2005). Gorsuch addressed a defendant who asserted she lacked the requisite mens rea

for the imposition of criminal liability, and the First Circuit concluded the sentencing court was

precluded from granting acceptance. Id. at *2-5. As Gorsuch noted, the First Circuit has applied

this same rule to a defendant who asserted self-defense. Id. at *2 (citing United States v. Bello,

194 F.3d 18 (1st Cir. 1999)); see also United States v. Mikutowicz, 365 F.3d 65, 75-77 (1st Cir.

2004); United States v. Waloke, 962 F.2d 824 (8th Cir. 1992).

        Even if Mr. Bishop did not deny possessing the firearms, 4 he urged the jury to conclude

his possession was justified by necessity. This Court cannot distinguish between the justification

of self-defense, which failed in Bello, and the justification of necessity, which must fail here.

Moreover, upon hearing Mr. Bishop’s explanation, this Court concluded during trial that he had

not sufficiently raised the evidentiary predicate for asserting the necessity defense to generate a

jury instruction. See United States v. Smith, 982 F.2d 681, 685 (1st Cir. 1993); United States v.

Harper, 802 F.2d 115, 117 (5th Cir. 1986).

II. CONCLUSION

        This Court concludes that Mr. Bishop’s 1978 burglary conviction and his 1991

possession of an unregistered firearm conviction are “violent felonies” within the meaning of the

ACCA and that he is not entitled to a two-level reduction for acceptance under U.S.S.G. §

3E1.1(a).

  There is some disagreement between the Government and Mr. Bishop as to which weapons he admitted
possessing. However, in view of the basis for the decision in this case, it is unnecessary to resolve this disparity.
