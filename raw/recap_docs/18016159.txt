                  ORDER AFFIRMING THE
       RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE

        The United States Magistrate Judge filed with the Court on September

  19, 2014 his Recommended Decision (ECF No. 105 at 1:11-cr-00132-JAW;

  ECF No. 54 at 1:11-cr-00235-JAW). The Petitioner filed his objections to the

  Recommended Decision on May 14, 2015 (ECF No. 116 at 1:11-cr-00132-JAW;

  ECF No. 69 at 1:11-cr-00235-JAW).        I have reviewed and considered the

  Magistrate Judge’s Recommended Decision, together with the entire record; I

  have made a de novo determination of all matters adjudicated by the

  Magistrate Judge’s Recommended Decision; and I concur with the

  recommendations of the United States Magistrate Judge for the reasons set

  forth in his Recommended Decision, and determine that no further

  proceeding is necessary.

        1. It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the
           Magistrate Judge be and hereby is AFFIRMED.

        2. It is further ORDERED that the Petitioner’s 28 U.S.C. § 2255

           Petition (ECF No. 87 at 1:11-cr-00132-JAW; ECF No. 37 at 1:11-cr-
           00235-JAW) be and hereby is DISMISSED.

        3. It is further ORDERED that no certificate of appealability should
           issue in the event the Petitioner files a notice of appeal because
           there is no substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional
           right within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).

        SO ORDERED.
