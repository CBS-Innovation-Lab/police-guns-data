          GOVERNMENT’S OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR
                       COMPASSIONATE RELEASE

       The United States of America, through undersigned counsel, hereby submits this

opposition to the Defendant’s Motion for Compassionate Release under 18 U.S.C. §

3582(c)(1)(A) (“Defense Motion”), ECF #66. Defendant’s motion fails on several grounds and

should be denied.

       First, Lenord has not yet exhausted his administrative remedies as required by 18 U.S.C.

§ 3582(c)(1)(A). Every appellate court that has considered the issue has held that this statute

established a mandatory claims-processing rule that federal inmates must follow before seeking

relief in federal court. See United States v. Franco, ___ F.3d ___, 2020 WL 5249369, *2-*3 (5th

Cir. Sept. 3, 2020); United States v. Alam, 960 F.3d 831, 832 (6th Cir. 2020); United States v.

Raia, 954 F.3d 594, 597 (3d Cir. 2020); United States v. Springer, ___ Fed.Appx. ___, 2020 WL

3989451, at *3 (10th Cir. July 15, 2020). Where Congress “includes administrative exhaustion

in the relevant statute… ‘courts have a role in creating exceptions only if Congress wants them

to.’” United States v. Monzon, No. 99CR157 (DLC), 2020 WL 550220, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4,

2020) (quoting Ross, 136 S. Ct. at 1857); see also United States v. Ramirez, No. CR 17-10328-

WGY, 2020 WL 2404858, at *8 (D. Mass. May 12, 2020) (“statutory requirements are more

rigid than judge-made law, and are subject to very few exceptions”). Because Lenord has not

exhausted his administrative remedies, his motion must be denied.

       Second, even if administrative exhaustion were not applicable, Lenord is a healthy, 28

year old male, who does not suffer from a medical condition that constitutes an “extraordinary

and compelling reason” sufficient to warrant modification of his sentence pursuant to

§ 3582(c)(1)(A)(i).

       Third, FCI-Schuylkill (where Lenord is incarcerated) currently has zero cases of COVID-

19 among staff and inmates.1 This strongly suggests that the policies and procedures

implemented by the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) at FCI- Schuylkill have proven successful in

containing and mitigating the spread of the virus, and further counsel that release is

inappropriate.

       Fourth, even if Lenord were able to satisfy the “extraordinary and compelling reason”

threshold necessary to consider compassionate release, the balance of the remaining factors set

forth in § 3553(a) do not weigh in favor of his release. The Court has already carefully weighed

the plea agreement, and probation’s evaluation of the offense level and criminal history in the

PSR. The parties were able to agree to a sentence of 37 months (ECF #44) that satisfied the

Section 3553 factors, while permitting the Defendant an opportunity for rehabilitation, release

and reentry to society much sooner than he may have otherwise. In the context of a healthy

young man incarcerated pursuant to a joint sentencing recommendation at a facility with zero

cases of COVID-19, the Defendant’s release would present an untenable risk of danger to the

community, would undermine the significance of the agreed-to sentence and the Court’s findings

in adopting it, and would otherwise not be “consistent with applicable policy statements issued

by the Sentencing Commission,” 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A), or the sentencing factors under

Section 3553.

       For all of these reasons, this Court should deny Lenord’s motion for release.

                                             CONCLUSION

       For the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny Defendant’s Emergency Motion for

Compassionate Release from Incarceration.
