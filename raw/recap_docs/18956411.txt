          The assented to motion to reschedule jury trial (document no.

24    )    filed    by   the   government   is   granted;   Final   Pretrial   is

rescheduled to October 21, 2010 at 3:00pm; Trial is continued to

the two-week period beginning November 2, 2010, 09:30.

          Defendants shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights within

10 days.        The court finds that the ends of justice served by

granting a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and

the defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv), for

the reasons set forth in the motion.

          SO ORDERED.
