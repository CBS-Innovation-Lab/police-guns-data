KEVIN EARL SPRING                              )


                   ORDER ON THIRD MOTION FOR ACQUITTAL

       On December 15, 2011, the Court in a bench trial found Kevin Earl Spring,

who had previously been involuntarily admitted to a mental health institution

under 34-B M.R.S. § 3863, a provision of Maine law, guilty of making a false

statement in connection with the acquisition of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C.

§ 922(a)(6) and making a false statement during the purchase of a firearm in

violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(a)(1)(A) based on his statements on an ATF Form that

he had not previously been involuntarily committed to a mental health institution.1

On January 13, 2012, after conviction but before sentencing, the First Circuit issued

United States v. Rehlander, 666 F.3d 45 (1st Cir. 2012), overruling United States v.

Chamberlain, 159 F.3d 656 (1st Cir. 1998), and holding that an involuntary

emergency psychiatric admission under 34-B M.R.S. § 3863 does not constitute a




1       A number of provisions in Title 18 cover the making of a false statement in the acquisition of
a firearm. The Indictment charged Mr. Spring in Count One with a violation of 18 U.S.C. §
922(a)(6), making a false statement in connection with the acquisition of a firearm, and in Count
Two with a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(a)(1)(A), making a false statement during the purchase of a
firearm. Indictment (Docket # 57). The Indictment charged the same false statement in both Counts
One and Two, namely that Mr. Spring falsely denied he had been involuntarily committed to a
mental institution. Id.
Case 1:11-cr-00053-JAW Document 170 Filed 08/09/12 Page 2 of 17                 PageID #: 531



commitment under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(4).2 At trial, Mr. Spring was also convicted of

a third count, possession of a firearm by a prohibited person. Because, in the wake

of Rehlander, Mr. Spring’s emergency admission in Maine did not constitute a

commitment, the Government promptly dismissed Count III, the possession charge.

However, the Government has not moved to dismiss Counts I and II, the false

statement convictions, contending instead that the crime of making a false

statement must be measured by the law in effect at the time of the statement and

the crime was complete when Mr. Spring’s statement, which was then false, was

made. Citing Rehlander, Mr. Spring has moved for acquittal.

       In Rehlander, the First Circuit predicted that “[c]omplications may result, in

relation to prior convictions of others based on Chamberlain,” but explained that

“the problems will be resolved if and as they are presented.” 666 F.3d at 51. This

case presents such a problem.          The question is whether Rehlander mandates

acquittal of a defendant convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(a)(6) and

924(a)(1)(A) based on Chamberlain but not yet sentenced.                 With considerable

hesitation, the Court concludes that the convictions must not stand.

I.      STATEMENT OF FACTS

       A.      The Case Pre-Rehlander

       Based on the law before Rehlander, the Government presented an especially

compelling case against Kevin Earl Spring. In December 2010, Mr. Spring was

living in his house in Owl’s Head, Maine when he began to act oddly. Believing that


2      The First Circuit’s opinion in Rehlander addressed the involuntary commitment underlying
Mr. Spring’s statements leading to the false statement charges in both Counts.

Case 1:11-cr-00053-JAW Document 170 Filed 08/09/12 Page 3 of 17        PageID #: 532



neighborhood teenagers had entered his home by a secret entrance to steal his

copper piping, he boarded up some of the windows in his house and stood guard.

After Mr. Spring called his neighbors, asking them for help in fending off people

who were supposedly trying to enter Mr. Spring’s house, and after they saw him

with a gun, the neighbors called the police.

      When the police arrived on December 29, 2010, Mr. Spring was visibly

agitated and disheveled, but he let them in. He told the police that people were

trying to break into his house and steal from him. He claimed that they had taken

his furnace and copper piping and pointed to what he termed a “secret entrance” on

the floor, which was secured by a piece of plywood. The police inspected his house

and found no evidence of forced or secret entry. Upstairs in Mr. Spring’s bedroom,

however, they found a loaded bolt-action shotgun with a round in the chamber and

three rounds in the clip.

      The police told Mr. Spring that they were concerned about his mental health

and intended to take him to the hospital for evaluation. Mr. Spring did not like the

idea because he was worried that in his absence, the house would be broken into,

but he was cooperative. The police told him he had no choice and they intended to

take him to the hospital. Placing his shotgun in the trunk of the cruiser, the police

placed Mr. Spring in the back seat of the cruiser and took him to the local hospital

for evaluation.

      At PenBay Medical Center, Mr. Spring was evaluated by Dr. James Curtis,

an emergency room physician. Mr. Spring told the doctor that the night before, he




                                          3
Case 1:11-cr-00053-JAW Document 170 Filed 08/09/12 Page 4 of 17       PageID #: 533



had heard people sawing his copper pipes all night long. He also told the doctor

that there is a secret passageway that leads to his basement and these young adults

had found the passageway. The doctor checked with police and they confirmed they

had found no evidence that any teenagers had entered the home and no secret

passageway. After completing his examination of Mr. Spring, Dr. Curtis completed

an Application for Emergency Involuntary Admission to a Mental Hospital,

certifying that Mr. Spring had a mental illness that caused a substantial risk of

harm to others. On December 30, 2010, pursuant to 34-B M.R.S. § 3863, a justice of

the peace approved the application for emergency involuntarily admission.

      During his admission to the psychiatric ward of the hospital, Mr. Spring was

seen by Dr. Van Lonkhuyzen, a PenBay psychiatrist. Dr. Lonkhuyzen confirmed

the need for hospitalization based on his view that Mr. Spring was suffering from a

form of psychosis and represented a danger because of the loaded gun.           Dr.

Lonkhuyzen said that Mr. Spring asked to be released but the doctor had told him

that he was being held involuntarily.    At one point, Mr. Spring threatened to

contact the American Civil Liberties Union and to sue the police on the ground that

he had been illegally transported to PenBay. Under 34-B M.R.S. § 3863(5-A)(C), a

hospital is not allowed to involuntarily detain a person who has been involuntarily

admitted on an emergency basis beyond three days. However, Mr. Spring agreed to

remain in the psychiatric unit until January 4, 2011, when he was discharged.

      On January 26, 2011, Mr. Spring began to look for a gun. He traveled to a

gun dealer in Vassalboro, Maine and expressed interest in attending a basic




                                        4
Case 1:11-cr-00053-JAW Document 170 Filed 08/09/12 Page 5 of 17       PageID #: 534



handgun course, which is a requirement for obtaining a concealed gun permit. The

gun dealer, Charles Cabaniss, testified that Mr. Spring appeared extremely

agitated. He said that Mr. Spring told him that he needed the gun because people

were breaking into his house and stealing copper and he wanted a gun to protect

himself. Mr. Spring showed Mr. Cabaniss a photograph of his basement and asked

Mr. Cabaniss if he could see a person in the photograph. Mr. Cabaniss could not see

anyone in the photograph.

      Mr. Spring expressed an interest in purchasing either a revolver or a

handgun. The gun dealer, however, was extremely concerned about whether Mr.

Spring was in his right mind and had Mr. Spring fill out the top part of ATF Form

4473 to obtain identifying information about him. Mr. Cabaniss directly asked Mr.

Spring whether he had ever been committed to a mental institution and Mr. Spring

stumbled, telling Mr. Cabaniss that his lawyer would take care of all of this. Mr.

Cabaniss informed Mr. Spring that anyone who had been involuntarily placed in a

mental institution was prohibited from purchasing a firearm and Mr. Cabaniss told

Mr. Spring that he needed to do some research to determine whether he could sell

him a firearm. Mr. Spring left. Mr. Cabaniss was so concerned about Mr. Spring

that he emailed an ATF agent about him and later emailed a deputy sheriff, raising

concerns about Mr. Spring’s mental state and his interest in purchasing a firearm.

      The next day, on January 27, 2011, despite the fact that Ellsworth is a

considerable distance from Rockland, Mr. Spring drove to Ellsworth, Maine to

purchase a firearm. Mr. Spring went to a firearms dealer in Ellsworth and told the




                                         5
Case 1:11-cr-00053-JAW Document 170 Filed 08/09/12 Page 6 of 17        PageID #: 535



dealer that the reason he wanted to buy a gun was that people were after him and

his property and that he was in fear of his life.    He focused on a 9mm Glock

handgun, completed and signed a Form 4473 in which he denied that he had ever

been committed to a mental institution, and paid for the firearm. The actual sale of

the Glock was delayed by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.

      At his trial, Mr. Spring did not testify but he presented a strong argument

that a reasonable person would not construe an involuntary emergency psychiatric

admission under 34-B M.R.S. § 3863 as an involuntary commitment within the

language of the ATF form.     His argument was weakened, however, by his own

actions. Something out of the ordinary had taken place on December 29-30, 2010,

when he had been taken by the police against his will to the mental health ward of

a hospital and held there against his will. Furthermore, Mr. Spring was clearly

placed on notice by the first dealer that he probably was prohibited from purchasing

a firearm but, the next day, he drove miles away from his home and purchased a

gun from a second dealer without revealing his prior involuntary admission on the

required forms and without confirming whether he was prohibited from possessing

a firearm under then current law.

      Mr. Spring’s defense foundered on clear and unequivocal First Circuit

precedent. See United States v. Chamberlain, 159 F.3d 656, 665 (1st Cir. 1998)

(concluding “that a five-day emergency detention [under 34-B M.R.S. § 3863] is a

‘commitment’” for purposes of the Gun Control Act); see also United States v. Holt,

464 F.3d 101, 105 (1st Cir. 2006) (“the [Chamberlain] court held that the five-day




                                         6
Case 1:11-cr-00053-JAW Document 170 Filed 08/09/12 Page 7 of 17        PageID #: 536



detention was a ‘commitment,’ concluding that the substance of the mental institute

admission procedures, rather than the label of the procedures as a ‘commitment,’ is

controlling for the federal statute”); United States v. Small, No. CR-09-184-B-W,

2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13698, at *5 (D. Me. Feb. 16, 2010) (noting that “ordinary

meaning, First Circuit precedent, and statutory context provided ample notice that

emergency hospitalization under Maine law qualified as committed under

§ 922(g)(4)”) (internal punctuation omitted). Applying Chamberlain and its progeny

to these facts, the Court found Mr. Spring guilty of two counts of making a false

statement in connection with the acquisition of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C.

§ 922(a)(6).

      B.       The Case Post-Rehlander

      On January 13, 2012, the First Circuit reversed Chamberlain.              See

Rehlander, 666 F.3d 45, 50-51 (“[t]he district court cannot be faulted for following

Chamberlain, but the panel is constrained to abandon that decision”). The First

Circuit stated:

      As we read section 922 in light of the concerns already discussed, a
      temporary hospitalization under section 3863 does not constitute a
      “commitment” under section 922just as it clearly does not constitute
      a commitment under Maine law itself.

Id. at 50.     Applying Rehlander to these facts, if Mr. Spring had attempted to

purchase a firearm after that case was issued, the Court would have been compelled

to acquit Mr. Spring because his answer to the ATF question about whether he had

been previously involuntarily committed to a mental institution would no longer be

false because his involuntary emergency psychiatric admission under 34-B M.R.S. §



                                         7
Case 1:11-cr-00053-JAW Document 170 Filed 08/09/12 Page 8 of 17          PageID #: 537



3863 would not have constituted a commitment under 18 U.S.C. § 922. But because

Mr. Spring made his statement on the ATF Form prior to the Rehlander change in

law, the question becomes whether Rehlander’s ruling on what constitutes a

“commitment” for purposes of the Gun Control Act alters Mr. Spring’s false

statement liability.

II.    THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

       Mr. Spring argues that his statements were not false because his temporary

hospitalization did not constitute a commitment under Maine law in light of

Rehlander’s January, 2012 change in law. In his Reply, Mr. Spring contends that

the Government’s position is internally inconsistent:

       The government argues . . . that although Mr. Spring had never been
       involuntarily committed to a mental institution, and could lawfully
       possess a firearm, it was unlawful for him to tell a firearms dealer that
       he had never been involuntarily committed or to write that fact on a
       federal firearms form.

Def.’s Reply at 2.

       The Government’s response is that the timing of Mr. Spring’s statement is

instructive and that he “is not entitled to the benefit of a First Circuit decision

issued a year after his false statement because the law governing commitments was

different when he made the statement.” Gov’t’s Supp. Br. at 1. To support its

position that the verdicts on the false statement counts should be sustained, the

Government refers to case law that has upheld firearms convictions based on false

statements about underlying felony convictions that were later vacated.

III.   DISCUSSION

       A.    The Timing of False Statements

       The closest analogue to Mr. Spring’s false statement conviction is a series of

cases involving convicted felons, whose disqualifying felony was valid as of the date

of purchase but was later overturned. Courts have concluded that despite the later

annulment of the person’s felony, the applicant still owed a legal duty to be truthful

as of the date of purchase and his later vindication did not affect his conviction for

false statement. See, e.g., Cassity v. United States, 521 F.2d 1320, 1322 (6th Cir.

1975); United States v. Graves, 554 F.2d 65, 70-72 (3d Cir. 1977) (en banc); United

States v. Allen, 556 F.2d 720, 722 (4th Cir. 1977); United States v. Ransom, 545 F.2d

481, 484 (5th Cir. 1977); United States v. Edwards, 568 F.2d 68, 70 (8th Cir. 1977);

United States v. Johnson, 612 F.2d 305, 306 (7th Cir. 1980). Indeed, in 1981, the

First Circuit affirmed without opinion a district court decision that arrived at the

same result. See United States v. Kozerski, 518 F. Supp. 1082, 1092 (D.N.H. 1981),

aff’d 740 F.2d 952 (1st Cir. 1984).

       These cases show that a defendant who makes a false statement where the

underlying prohibition later changes or is found to be invalid remains liable for the

separate crime of making a false statement. See, e.g., Graves, 554 F.2d at 79 (“[w]e

are satisfied that § 922(a)(6) compels disclosure of all convictions which have not

been set aside, whether ultimately shown to have been valid or not” and that

§ 922(a)(6) “penalizes [a defendant] not for being a convicted felon, but for failing to

tell the truth about the conviction”); see also Cassity, 521 F.2d at 1323 (“[w]e




                                           9
Case 1:11-cr-00053-JAW Document 170 Filed 08/09/12 Page 10 of 17          PageID #: 539



 conclude . . . that the careful statutory scheme of gun control Congress has provided

 would be seriously jeopardized if a person convicted of a felony could, when

 purchasing a firearm, make the statement that he had never been convicted of such

 felony based upon his own subjective belief that his conviction was constitutionally

 defective where such conviction had not prior to been set aside”) (emphasis supplied).

 In other words, these cases represent the basic premise that false statement

 liability attaches where the statement was false when made, despite subsequent

 legal or factual developments that would counsel a different answer on a later date.

 By the same logic, Mr. Spring’s false statement conviction does not penalize him or

 remove his individual right to bear arms for having been involuntarily admitted to a

 mental institution; it penalizes him for falsely reporting in January, 2011 that he

 was not a prohibited person when, at that time under governing law, he was.

       In United States v. Wright, 537 F.2d 1144 (1st Cir. 1976), the First Circuit

 addressed the situation where a defendant thinks that he is or should be permitted

 to own a gun but as a matter of law is not, and nevertheless answers questions

 falsely on the federal ATF forms in order to obtain one. Id. at 1146. The Wright

 defendant had a previous felony conviction but possessed a state-issued firearm

 permit that he believed entitled him to own a gun; when filling out the required

 forms he represented he did not have a prior felony conviction. See id. at 1144-45.

 In Wright, the Court held that “[e]ven if he could be found to think that the state

 permit allowed him to purchase guns, he could not think that it permitted him to

 make ‘false and fictitious statements’ to the federal government, the offense with




                                          10
Case 1:11-cr-00053-JAW Document 170 Filed 08/09/12 Page 11 of 17          PageID #: 540



 which he is charged.” Id. at 1146. The First Circuit went on to note that “[t]he

 most that could be said is that a belief on [the defendant]’s part that he had a right

 to purchase the gun bore on the recklessness vel non with which he signed the

 federal form.”    Id. (upholding false statement conviction based on reckless

 disregard).

       At trial, Mr. Spring took a similar position: that he did not know his

 involuntary admission constituted a commitment, which is what the ATF form asks.

 However, the Court found that under the law as it existed at the time, he had been

 so committed when he tried to make the firearms purchases and that he had lied

 when he completed the forms. As several other Circuits have acknowledged, the

 underlying congressional intent in imposing false statement liability on federal

 firearm acquisition forms is to compel full and honest disclosure. See Cassity, 521

 F.2d at 1323 (“[w]e think it apparent from the language employed that Congress

 intended to provide a scheme of regulation by compelling full and honest

 disclosure”); see also Ransom, 545 F.2d at 483-84 (“[w]e agree with the rationale of

 Cassity”). The plain fact is that Mr. Spring did not fully and honestly disclose his

 involuntary admission on the ATF forms, and his answer was false at the time he

 made it.

       As Mr. Spring’s statement on the forms that he had not been committed was

 false under the governing law, these cases support the conclusion that Mr. Spring is

 not permitted to avoid criminal liability for making a statement that was false when

 he made it, only because the First Circuit later changed its position as to the degree




                                          11
Case 1:11-cr-00053-JAW Document 170 Filed 08/09/12 Page 12 of 17           PageID #: 541



 of due process required under Maine state law before prohibited person status

 attaches. To allow individuals seeking firearms in the future to provide answers to

 these forms based on their “guesses” as to the state of the law in a week, a month,

 or a year would arguably run afoul of the purpose of these forms: to “compel[] full

 and honest disclosure” from persons seeking to purchase firearms. Cassity, 521

 F.2d at 1323.

       B.     Retroactivity and Rehlander

       Nevertheless, this is a hard case, and the Court is uneasy about finding Mr.

 Spring guilty for actions that under current law would not constitute a criminal

 offense.   To be clear, its wariness is not because Mr. Spring was wrongfully

 convicted under the law as it stood as of the date of his offenses or as of the date of

 his trial. Nor is it because Mr. Spring was found guilty of a technical violation of

 the criminal law. To the contrary, from a policy viewpoint, the Court is comfortable

 that the people of this Country, especially Mr. Spring’s immediate neighbors and

 the teenage boys in his community, would be safer if Mr. Spring, with his psychoses,

 paranoia, and delusions, were barred from purchasing a firearm to defend his

 property from imaginary trespassers and if the police had the authority to take his

 guns from him. The unquestioned wisdom of preventing mentally ill individuals

 from purchasing firearms and ammunition is forcefully brought home in the terrible

 tragedies that periodically take place in this Country when paranoid or psychotic

 persons gain access to firearms.




                                           12
Case 1:11-cr-00053-JAW Document 170 Filed 08/09/12 Page 13 of 17          PageID #: 542



       Furthermore, in Heller, the Supreme Court itself was careful to observe that

 “nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions

 on the possession of firearms by . . . the mentally ill,” Dist. of Columbia v. Heller,

 554 U.S. 570, 626 (2008), and in Rehlander, the First Circuit did not question the

 wisdom of Congress’s determination that those who are mentally ill should be

 prohibited from purchasing firearms, Rehlander, 666 F.3d at 48 (“[t]he Supreme

 Court made clear in Heller that its decision did not undercut traditional restrictions

 on the possession of arms by those who were mentally ill”). Rather, the Rehlander

 Court was concerned with the absence of due process under Maine statutory law

 before a person like Mr. Spring is deprived of the constitutional right to bear arms.

 Id. at 48-49.   In keeping with this precedent, the Court readily concludes that Mr.

 Spring and those around him would be safer and better off if he did not have the

 right to bear arms and, but for Rehlander, the Court would not hesitate to issue a

 judgment that constrained that right for Mr. Spring.

       The Heller Court left much unanswered. However, there is no suggestion

 that the Supreme Court’s or the First Circuit’s interpretation of the Second

 Amendment allows the potential purchaser of a firearm to lie about his mental

 health history on an ATF form. See, e.g., United States v. Knight, 574 F. Supp. 2d

 224, 226 (D. Me. 2008) (“Heller certainly does not eliminate the crime of false

 statements”).    The Rehlander Court addressed the extent of the due process

 required to prohibit firearm possession, but the First Circuit did not eliminate the

 crime of false statements, and Mr. Spring’s argument that Rehlander directly




                                          13
Case 1:11-cr-00053-JAW Document 170 Filed 08/09/12 Page 14 of 17        PageID #: 543



 removes his false statement liability because of the changing nature of the right to

 bear arms necessarily fails.

       The Court’s disquiet is based on the principle that when the First Circuit

 announces a change in the criminal law that grants additional individual rights

 based on an application of a Supreme Court interpretation of the United States

 Constitution, the persons whose cases are pending at the time of the decision should

 benefit from the more expansive reading of individual rights.        But for these

 convictions, if Mr. Spring were today to proceed to a licensed firearms dealer, he

 could legally answer “no” to the “have you been committed” question and legally

 purchase a firearm. Why then should he remain convicted of a crime, which would

 not be a crime if he committed the same act today?

       The answer to this question depends on how the courts apply changes in

 constitutional interpretation.   If Mr. Spring’s case were over, he would have a

 difficult time persuading a court that the criminal judgment should be set aside

 because of a new constitutional doctrine. However, in Mr. Spring’s case, the Court’s

 judgment was not final on January 13, 2012, when the First Circuit issued

 Rehlander, and it seems harsh to hold Mr. Spring to the letter of a law that after

 the decision would clearly apply to similarly situated individuals. See Teague v.

 Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 300 (1989) (“once a new rule is applied to the defendant in the

 case announcing the rule, evenhanded justice requires that it be applied

 retroactively to all who are similarly situated”).   The Court turns, then, to the

 question of how the courts apply a decision announcing a new constitutional

 doctrine.

       “Generally speaking, where the Supreme Court announces ‘a new rule, that

 rule applies to all criminal cases still pending on direct review.” United States v.

 Thomas, 627 F.3d 534, 537 (4th Cir. 2010) (quoting Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 U.S.

 348, 351 (2004)). Even for cases not on direct review, a new substantive rule will

 apply retroactively; new substantive rules are those where the scope of a criminal

 statute     is   narrowed   by   interpreting    its   terms   or   where   “constitutional

 determinations [] place particular conduct or persons covered by the statute beyond

 the State’s power to punish.” Schriro, 542 U.S. at 351-52. The Supreme Court’s

 decision in Heller was one such new substantive rule, affording an individual right

 to bear arms not previously acknowledged by the Court and the First Circuit’s

 decision in Rehlander, which flowed from Heller, also afforded an individual a basic

 range of due process rights before his Second Amendment rights are foreclosed.

       Under Supreme Court precedent, Mr. Spring’s case is not yet final. Clay v.

 United States, 537 U.S. 522, 527 (2003) (“[f]inality attaches when [the Supreme

 Court] affirms a conviction on the merits on direct review or denies a petition for

 writ of certiorari, or when the time for filing a certiorari petition expires”).

 Applying this definition to Mr. Spring, the case against him is still pending and a

 new rule would apply. The Rehlander Court announced such a new rule. Under

 Chamberlain, a class of persons—namely, individuals who had been subject to an

 emergency involuntary psychiatric admission under Maine law—were required to




                                             15

 reveal on the ATF form that they had been “committed” to a mental health

 institution; since Rehlander, “particular conduct or persons covered by the

 statute”—namely, those same people—are “beyond the [Government’s] power to

 punish.” Schriro, 542 U.S. at 352

       Although distinctions may be made between unlawful possession and making

 a false statement in connection with the acquisition of a firearm, in Rehlander, the

 First Circuit reversed the convictions for both Nathan Rehlander and Benjamin

 Small, each of whom had been convicted for possessing firearms after having been

 “committed to a mental institution.” Rehlander, 666 F.3d at 46, 50-51. These men

 violated the law by possessing the firearms under Chamberlain because they had

 been “committed to a mental institution” under § 922(g)(4), but in Rehlander, the

 First Circuit concluded that because their admissions were not commitments, they

 had not violated the law against possession by a person so committed. Id. at 50.

 Here, Mr. Spring is a step removed from actual possession, but the same principle

 applies. As a consequence of Rehlander, neither Mr. Rehlander nor Mr. Small is

 guilty of actual possession of a firearm by a person who had been committed to a

 mental institution because the First Circuit’s reading of the United States

 Constitution dictates that they had not been committed. The same principle should

 apply to Mr. Spring and he should not stand convicted of saying he was not

 committed when, under Rehlander, he has not. Based on Schriro and Rehlander,

 the Court applies Rehlander’s change to the definition of “commitment” to Mr.

 Spring’s case and grants the Defendant’s third motion for acquittal.
