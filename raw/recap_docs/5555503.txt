     MOTION TO SET STATUS CONFERENCE AND EXTEND TIME TO REPORT ON
                        STATUS OF PLEA PROPOSAL

       The Court previously imposed a deadline of June 23, 2008, by

which the government was to report to the Court the status of a

proposed universal plea agreement.           The government hereby

requests an extension of that deadline to August 29, 2008.                 As

grounds, on June 10, 2008, Judge Gorton set a trial date of June

30, 2008, in the case United States v. Toussaint, 07-10046-NMG.

On June 23, 2008, defense counsel advised the government of

Toussaint’s intention to plead guilty.           On June 24, 2008,

Toussaint entered a plea of guilty.           Notwithstanding Toussaint’s

guilty plea, AUSA Connolly spent the time from June 10, 2008, to

June 24, 2008, preparing for trial in the Toussaint case, and was

unable to devote any time to resolving this case.

       Accordingly, the government requests an extension of time to

August 29, 2008, and further requests that the Court set a status

conference date in October 2008.
