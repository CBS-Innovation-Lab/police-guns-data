STATEMENT OF REASONS

VII COURT DETERM]`NATIONS OF RESTITUTION
A 11 restitution Not Appitcable.
B Total Amount ot"Restitution:

C Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

l l:l For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S¢C. § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

2 m For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
issues offact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to providc restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(B).
3 l:l For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S,C_ § 3663 and/or required by thc sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting ti'om the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh

the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(l)(B)(ii).

4 |:\ Restitution is not ordered for other reasons (Explain.)

D l:l Partial restitution is ordered for these reasons (18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)):
