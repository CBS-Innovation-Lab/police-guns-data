                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 06-cr-105-PB

Vincent Chaney



                                  O R D E R

     The government has moved to continue the trial scheduled for

February 3, 2009, citing the need for additional time to resolve

an interlocutory appeal currently pending in the First Circuit

Court of Appeals and scheduled for argument on March 2, 2009.

The defendant does not object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reason and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from February 3, 2009 to May 5, 2009.                 In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
