  MOTION TO VACATE OR CORRECT SENTENCE UNDER 28 U.S.C. § 2255;
         DEFENDANT CONVICTED UNDER 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)

        Now comes Defendant through undersigned counsel, and moves to vacate and
 correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 and Johnson v. United States, 135 S. Ct.
 2551, 2563 (2015) (Johnson II).
        Mr. Floyd was convicted of use and possession of a firearm during and in
 furtherance of a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c). The predicate
 crimes of violence were carjacking, death resulting, and conspiracy to commit carjacking
 in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 371 & 2119(3).
        In Johnson II, the Supreme Court struck the “residual clause” of the Armed Career
 Criminal Act (“ACCA”) violent felony definition, see 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), as
 unconstitutionally vague. In Welch v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 1257 (2016), the Supreme
 Court held that the rule announced in Johnson II is substantive and therefore retroactive
 to cases on collateral review. The residual clause at 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(3)(B) is
 substantially similar to the ACCA’s residual clause, struck in Johnson II. Following Johnson
 II, §924(c)(3)(B) is also void for vagueness. See In re Hubbard, No. 15-276, 2016 WL
 3181417 (4th Cir. June 8, 2016); Dimaya v. Lynch, 803 F.3d 1110, 1115 (9th Cir. 2015);
 United States v. Vivas-Ceja, 808 F.3d 719,720, 723 (7th Cir. 2015). Because the Supreme
 Court declared Johnson II retroactive as a substantive rule, the vagary of §924(c)(3)(B)

                                                     1

 should also apply retroactively. See, e.g., Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 620 (1998)
 (decision narrowing the elements of § 924(c) was retroactive).
        Mr. Floyd’s carjacking convictions satisfied 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) based on the now
 defunct residual clause. After Johnson II, defendant no longer has the predicate
 convictions to satisfy 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) and is therefore actually innocent of that
 offense. He is presently in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons serving an invalid
 sentence that is based on this conviction.
        A Memorandum in Support of this Motion will be filed in accordance with this
 court’s scheduling order.
