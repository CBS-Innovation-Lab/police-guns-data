                 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                       DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                   Criminal No. 10-cr-120-01-JL

Raymond Alleyne


                    ORDER OF DETENTION PENDING TRIAL


     In accordance with Section 3142(f) of the Bail Reform Act, 18

U.S.C. '' 3141 et seq., a hearing was conducted on October 6, 2010,

for the purpose of determining whether to detain defendant, Raymond

Alleyne, who has been indicted on a charge of possession of a firearm

by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. ' 922(g)(1).

     Under 18 U.S.C. ' 3142(b), a court, in making a determination

regarding detention, must evaluate the risk of the defendant=s flight,

the risk to the safety of any other person, and the risk to the safety

of the community.      In circumstances when detention is not mandated

by the court, the court is nonetheless empowered to impose conditions

on release.     18 U.S.C. ' 3142(c).

     Pursuant to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. ' 3142(g), a court, in

assessing the risks noted in 18 U.S.C. ' 3142(b), shall consider the

following: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense charged;

(2) the weight of the evidence as to guilt; (3) the history and



                                      1
          Case 1:10-cr-00120-JL Document 9 Filed 10/07/10 Page 2 of 5




characteristics of the accused, including family ties, past history,

financial resources and employment; and (4) the nature and

seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that would

be posed by a release.

     During the course of a hearing conducted pursuant to 18 U.S.C.

' 3142, the government retains the burden of persuading the court that

A>no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure

the defendant=s presence at trial.@        United States v. Perez-Franco,

839 F.2d 867, 870 (1st Cir. 1988) (quoting United States v.

Palmer-Contreras, 835 F.2d 15, 17-18 (1st Cir. 1987)); United States

v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d 789, 793 (1st Cir. 1991).          For its part, the

government is required to offer clear and convincing evidence of

dangerousness; and a preponderance of the evidence to prove risk of

flight.    See Patriarca, 948 F.2d at 792-93.       Facts necessary to find

that no combination will reasonably assure the safety of any person

and the community require satisfaction of the Aclear and convincing@

standard.    18 U.S.C. ' 3142(f)(2).

     Here, the government and the defendant agreed to conduct the

hearing by offers of proof.        The government did not argue that

defendant was a flight risk.        Rather, the government argued that

defendant's release would pose a danger to the community.               For the

reasons stated more fully on the record in this case, I find that



                                      2

the government satisfied its burden of persuading the court by clear

and convincing evidence that there are no conditions or combination

of conditions that will reasonably assure the safety of the

community.

     In so finding, the court stated on the record the factors upon

which it relied.     I summarize those factors below:

          The weight of the evidence is strong.

          The nature of the charge involves an inherently dangerous

          activity.    Defendant, a convicted felon, allegedly

          possessed a firearm.      The government's proffer included

          evidence that defendant was involved in selling guns and

          stated, on one occasion, that he wanted to "rob" gun

          suppliers in order to obtain more guns.

          Defendant has a substantial criminal record, which

          includes two prior drug convictions, and one burglary

          conviction.

          Defendant is a drug user.       Defendant admitted "daily"

          consumption of marijuana.       On the date of his initial

          appearance, defendant tested positive for marijuana and

          cocaine.




                                    3

          Although defendant has a current job, he has only had the

          job for a few months.       Defendant admitted to pretrial

          services that he does not keep his jobs for "any

          significant amount of time."

          The government's proffer included evidence that defendant

          supplements his income through gun sales.

     Upon full consideration of the arguments offered by the

government and defense, and for the reasons stated on the record,

I am satisfied that the government has met its burden of persuading

the court that defendant's release, even on strict conditions, would

pose a serious danger to the community.     For the reasons listed supra

and stated on the record, I find that there are no conditions or

combination of conditions that will assure the safety of the

community.   Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the defendant be

detained pending trial.

     The defendant is committed to the custody of the Attorney

General or his designated representative for confinement in a

corrections facility separate, to the extent practicable, from

persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody

pending appeal.   The defendant shall be afforded a reasonable




                                    4
         Case 1:10-cr-00120-JL Document 9 Filed 10/07/10 Page 5 of 5




opportunity for private consultation with defense counsel.             On order

of a court of the United States or on request of an attorney for the

Government, the person in charge of the corrections facility shall

deliver the defendant to the United States Marshal for the purpose

of an appearance in connection with a court proceeding.

      SO ORDERED.
