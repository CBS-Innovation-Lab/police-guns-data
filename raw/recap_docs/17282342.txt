                   DECISION AND ORDER ON DEFENDANT’S
                     MOTION TO DISMISS INDICTMENT


      The issue here is whether the recent Supreme Court decision in District of

Columbia v. Heller, 128 S. Ct. 2783 (2008), affects question 12.h on ATF Form

4473, the question that asks a firearms purchaser, “Are you subject to a court

order restraining you from harassing, stalking, or threatening your child or an

intimate partner or child of such partner?” I conclude that Heller does not affect

the materiality of the answer to question 12.h, and deny the defendant’s motion to

dismiss the indictment against him.

      The indictment charges the defendant with making a materially false

statement on October 14, 2004, in trying to purchase a firearm. According to 18

U.S.C. § 922(a)(6), it is unlawful for a firearms purchaser to make a “false . . .

written statement . . . intended or likely to deceive . . . [a firearms] dealer . . . with

respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale.”           Specifically, the

indictment charges that the defendant falsely answered “No” to question 12.h on

ATF From 4473, whereas just such an Order had been entered against him on

August 26, 2004.

      The defendant asks me to dismiss the Indictment as a result of the recent

Supreme Court decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, 128 S. Ct. 2783. In

Heller, the Court recognized for the first time an individual right under the Second

Amendment to bear arms, and struck down the District of Columbia’s outright

ban on handgun possession. But Heller also stated that “nothing in [its] opinion

should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of

firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms

in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings,” id. at 2816-17,

and made clear that those were only examples of presumptively lawful

prohibitions, not an exhaustive list. Id. at n.26. Heller made no specific reference

to prohibitions on firearms possession on the part of defendants subject to

domestic abuse protection orders, a prohibition that is not as “longstanding” as

the prohibition on felons possessing firearms.       Nor did Heller refer to false

statement crimes.

      I observe first that this defendant is not charged with illegally possessing a

firearm. Instead he is charged with giving a materially false answer to an ATF-

crafted question while he was attempting to purchase a firearm. Heller certainly

does not eliminate the crime of false statements. The defendant’s argument needs

to be (neither he nor the government address their arguments this way) that his

false answer is no longer, in the words of the statute, “material to the lawfulness

of the sale.” 18 U.S.C. § 922(a)(6). In other words, his argument must be that, if
                                                                                  2
Case 2:07-cr-00127-DBH Document 67 Filed 09/04/08 Page 3 of 5               PageID #: 149



he is correct that people subject to a harassment order can no longer be

prohibited from carrying firearms, then the truthfulness of his answer to question

12.h is no longer material to the lawfulness of the sale. I will proceed on the

premise that this is the nature of the dispute here.

      The answer to question 12.h is material to a firearms dealer in selling a

firearm only if § 922(g)(8) lawfully prohibits people who are subject to certain

court orders from possessing a firearm.          If Heller makes such a prohibition

unconstitutional, then the § 922(g)(8) crime can no longer exist and the answer to

question 12.h is no longer material.         I conclude that Heller does not make

unconstitutional the § 922(g)(8) crime. Unlike Heller, the § 922(g)(8) crime is not

an outright ban on firearm possession. Instead, the prohibition lasts only as long

as the underlying state court order is in effect. And the scope of the prohibition is

actually quite narrow. It applies only if the pertinent court order:

             (A) was issued after a hearing of which such person received
             actual notice, and at which such person had an opportunity
             to participate;
             (B) restrains such person from harassing, stalking, or
             threatening an intimate partner of such person or child of
             such intimate partner or person, or engaging in other conduct
             that would place an intimate partner in reasonable fear of
             bodily injury to the partner or child; and
             (C) (i) includes a finding that such person represents a
             credible threat to the physical safety of such intimate partner
             or child; or
             (ii) by its terms explicitly prohibits the use, attempted use, or
             threatened use of physical force against such intimate partner
             or child that would reasonably be expected to cause bodily
             injury.

18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(8). Reducing domestic violence is a compelling government

interest, see United States v. Lippman, 369 F.3d 1039, 1043 (8th Cir. 2004), cert.


                                                                                        3

denied, 543 U.S. 1080 (2005), and 922(g)(8)’s temporary prohibition, while the

state court order is outstanding, is narrowly tailored to that compelling interest.

Id. Accord United States v. Emerson, 270 F.3d 203 (5th Cir. 2001), cert. denied,

536 U.S. 907 (2002).1        The threatened conduct that is a prerequisite to the

prohibition is serious: “harassing, stalking, threatening,” or other conduct that

would cause “reasonable fear of bodily injury”; and the court order must make a

specific finding of “a credible threat to the physical safety” of an intimate partner

or child or an explicit prohibition on the use of force “that would reasonably be

expected to cause bodily injury.” 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(8). These are narrowly crafted

limits on when a citizen may possess a firearm and well tuned to the legitimate

concerns of avoiding serious physical injury to a partner or child. I conclude that

Heller does not make the prohibition unconstitutional. Since the prohibition is

still valid, the answer to question 12.h remains material.

       The defendant makes a number of other arguments that are premised on

what he believed at the time he tried to purchase the firearm, what his lawyer told

him, what the state judge said in his order (that the order did not prohibit firearm

possession), etc. But all of these, if they are relevant at all, affect only whether the

government can prove the necessary state of mind for the crime, not the

constitutionality of § 922(g)(8), and hence the materiality of the defendant’s false

answer.

       For those reasons, the motion to dismiss the indictment is DENIED.
