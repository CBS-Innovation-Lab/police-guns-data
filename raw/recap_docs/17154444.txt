                   RECOMMENDED DECISION ON MOTION TO DISMISS


       The defendant, charged with possession of a shotgun by a person convicted of a misdemeanor

crime of domestic violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(9) and 924(a)(2) and possession of an

unregistered shotgun in violation of 26 U.S.C. §§ 5841, 5861(d) and 5871, Indictment (Docket No. 1)

at 1-2, moves to dismiss the indictment on the basis of “pre-accusatory delay.” Motion to Dismiss,

Pre-Accusatory Delay (Docket No. 19) at 1. Specifically, he alleges that he has suffered “actual

prejudice and presumed prejudice” because the indictment charges him with misconduct alleged to

have occurred from January 2001 to March 2002, yet the indictment was not returned until October

2006. Id. He asserts that “[i]t is not practical to mandate the defendant to recreate an alibi which is

so old” and that “[t]he retrieval of defenses, witnesses, items and exhibits from 5 years ago or more is

so prejudicial as to be presumptive.” Id. Finally, he asserts that the government “still has not

produced evidence (after a discovery request) showing the witnesses who will allege that Defendant

possessed the firearm from January 2001 to March 2002.” Id. at 2.

       The government responds that the statute of limitations applicable to the crimes charged does

not expire until March 4, 2007. Government’s Opposition to Defendant’s Motion[] to . . . Dismiss

(“Opposition”) (Docket No. 32) at 10. If that is the case, the defendant must demonstrate that he has

suffered “actual, substantial prejudice [and] that the prosecution orchestrated the delay to gain a

tactical advantage over him.” United States v. Kenrick, 221 F.3d 19, 33 (1st Cir. 2000). The

government also professes to be unaware of any request from counsel for the defendant for discovery

concerning witnesses, but avers that it has provided to the defense “the record of Mr. Randall’s

admissions to Detectives Lucier and Tapley.” Opposition at 10.

        The indictment alleges that both charged crimes continued “until about March 3, 2002 and

thereafter.” Indictment at 1 & 2. The statute of limitations applicable to these crimes requires that the

indictment be found “within five years next after such offense shall have been committed.” 18 U.S.C.

§ 3282(a). The indictment, returned on October 24, 2006, id. at 2, thus was brought within the period

of the statute of limitations. The First Circuit stated in Kenrick that a defendant seeking dismissal of

an indictment on the basis of pre-indictment delay must make the showing described above and may

not rely on “mere speculation and bare allegations.” 221 F.3d at 33. That is all that the defendant

offers here. The motion to dismiss should be denied.

        If the defendant continues to believe that the government has not provided him with discovery

to which he is entitled, that matter must be brought to the court’s attention by an appropriate motion.

On the showing made, such a lack of response adds nothing to the motion to dismiss.

        For the foregoing reasons, I recommend that the defendant’s motion to dismiss be DENIED.
