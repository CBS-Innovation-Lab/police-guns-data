                     MOTION FOR SOME DISPOSITION

TO THE HONORABLE JUAN M. PEREZ-GIMENEZ
U.S. DISTRICT COURT JUDGE
DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO

     COMES NOW, SILVIA ORTIZ-IZQUIERDO U.S. PROBATION OFFICER of

this Court, presenting an official report on the conduct and

attitude of releasee, Manuel Fernández-Torres, who on June 11,

2002, was sentenced to forty-one (41) months of imprisonment and a

three (3) year term of Supervised Release, after pleading guilty of

violating Title 18, United States Code, Sections 2113(a)and 2 in

criminal case 01-CR-401-04. On the same date, Mr. Manuel Fernández-

Torres, was also sentenced under criminal case number 99-CR-111-04,

to forty-one (41) months of imprisonment after pleading guilty of

violating Title 18, United States Code, Section 1951 (a), both

sentences were to be served concurrently.         As special conditions,

he was ordered to submit to urinalysis, provide access to any

financial information, make restitution in the amount of $900 to

Loomis Fargo & Co and pay $100 special assessment in each case.

Mr. Fernández-Torres’ supervised release commenced on June 11, 2002

     RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING CLARIFICATION OF SENTENCE:

     Although Mr. Fernández-Torres paid in full the Court Ordered

Sanctions, to wit: the $100 SMA and the $900 restitution imposed in

case number: 99CR401-04(PG), it has been a doubt whether the Court

intended to impose the same amount of restitution and SMA in case

number 99CR111-04(PG).

     WHEREFORE, in lieu of the aforementioned, it is respectfully

requested that the Court clarify this matter so that the U.S.

Probation Officer may appropriately enforce said conditions.

     In San Juan, Puerto Rico, this 11th day of May, 2005.



                                    Respectfully submitted,
