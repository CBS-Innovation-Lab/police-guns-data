                 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                      DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America,
      Plaintiff

            v.
                                        Case No. 12-cr-62-01-SM

Martin Philip Vachon,
      Defendant

                                ORDER


      Defendant Vachon’s motion to continue the final pretrial

conference and trial for 60 days is granted (document no. 9).

Trial has been rescheduled for the month of October 2012.

Defendant Vachon shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights not

later than August 6, 2012.

      The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting

a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A) and (B), in

that failure to grant a continuance would unreasonably deny the

defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective prepara-

tion taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances.

      Final Pretrial Conference is rescheduled for October 5,

2012 at 2:00 p.m.
