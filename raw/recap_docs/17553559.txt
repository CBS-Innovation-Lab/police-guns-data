C Reason(s) for Sentence Outside the Advisory Guide|ine System (Check all that apply.)

the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(3)(1)

to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to providejust punishment for the offense (18 U,S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A))
to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct( 13 U.S.C. § 3553(3)(2)(B))

to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant (18 U.S.C. § 3553(3)(2)(€))

ISLS[SLSE

to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner
(l8 U.S,C, § 3553(a)(2)(D))
|:| to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants (i 8 U.S.Cl § 3553(21)(6))

l:l to provide restitution to any victims ofthe offense (l8 U.S.C\ § 3553(a)(7))

D Explain the facts justifying a sentence outside the advisory guideline system. (UseSection VIII if necessary.)

] . The criminal history calculation does riot take into account that as to counts 6-8 the juvenile offense described in Par. 60
was completed more than 5 years earlier. Elimination of that offense would reduce the Criminal History Cat. to II and the
range to 22-41 months.

2. Defendant has been charges in a related case in which he has been in pretrial detention for 3 months The government has
agreed to dismiss that indictment and the sentence in this case reflects a reduction of this sentence by the period of detention
for which no credit is otherwise available

3. The sentence will hopefully, allow defendant to gain some structure, education and medical attention

STATEMENT OF REASONS

vii CoURT osTERMiNATioNS oF RESTiTu'rioN
A m institution Not Appiicabie.

B Total Amount of Restitution:
C Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

1 l:l For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under |8 U.S,C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S,C. § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

2 m For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(l3)‘
3 |:l For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines restitution is not
ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh

the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U.S C` § 3663(21)(1)(3)(ii).
