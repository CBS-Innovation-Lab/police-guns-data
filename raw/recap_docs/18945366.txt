                 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                       DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                   Criminal No. 10-cr-75-01-JL

Joseph M. Roux



                    ORDER OF DETENTION PENDING TRIAL


     In accordance with Section 3142(f) of the Bail Reform Act,

18 U.S.C. §§ 3141 et seq., a hearing was conducted on June 15,

2010, for the purpose of determining whether to detain defendant,

Joseph M. Roux, who has been indicted on one count of Possession

of a Firearm by a Prohibited Person, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §

922 (g)(1).

     When making a determination regarding detention under 18

U.S.C. § 3142(b), a court must evaluate the risk of the

defendant’s flight, the risk to the safety of any other person,

and the risk to the safety of the community.            In circumstances

when detention is not mandated by the court, the court is

nonetheless empowered to impose conditions on release.              See 18

U.S.C. § 3142(c).

     Pursuant to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) a court,

in assessing the risks noted in 18 U.S.C. § 3142(b), shall
          Case 1:10-cr-00075-JL Document 12 Filed 06/15/10 Page 2 of 4




consider the following:        (1) the nature and circumstances of the

offense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence as to guilt;

(3) the history and characteristics of the accused, including

family ties, past history, financial resources and employment;

and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or

the community that would be posed by a release.

     During the course of a hearing conducted pursuant to 18

U.S.C. § 3142, the government typically retains the burden of

persuading the court that “‘no condition or combination of

conditions will reasonably assure’ the defendant’s presence at

trial.”    United States v. Perez-Franco, 839 F.2d 867, 870 (1st

Cir. 1988)(quoting United States v. Palmer-Contreras, 835 F.2d

15, 17-18 (1st Cir. 1987)); see also United States v. Patriarca,

948 F.2d 789, 793 (1st Cir. 1991).          For its part, the government

is required to offer a preponderance of the evidence to prove

risk of flight.      See Patriarca, 948 F.2d at 792-93.         Facts

necessary to find that no combination will reasonably assure the

safety of any person and the community require satisfaction of

the “clear and convincing” standard.          See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f)(2).

     In the case at hand, the indictment itself constitutes

probable cause to believe that the offenses charged have been



                                       2

committed and that the defendant has committed them.

     Here, I find that the government has met its burden with

regard to risk of flight and danger to the community.          In so

finding, I rely on the following factors:        (a) the nature of the

charge involves the possession of a firearm by a felon; (b) the

circumstances of the charged offense include that the defendant

was highly intoxicated and discharged a weapon multiple times,

possessed numerous firearms, drove a vehicle through a garage

door, utilized a laser scope while brandishing a firearm, and

then was uncooperative with the police and resisted arrest; (c)

the defendant’s criminal record includes serious drug offenses

for which he served state prison sentences, and a prior

conviction for felon in possession; (d) the defendant has a

significant and unaddressed substance abuse problem; and (e)

while the defendant is a lifelong resident of New Hampshire, he

has not held a steady job for approximately twelve years.

     I am satisfied from the representations and documents

offered during the hearing that no condition or combination of

conditions will reasonably assure the safety of the community.

Upon full consideration of the arguments offered by the

government and defense, I am satisfied that the defendant poses a



                                    3
          Case 1:10-cr-00075-JL Document 12 Filed 06/15/10 Page 4 of 4




risk of flight and danger to the community.           Accordingly, I order

the defendant be detained pending trial.

        The defendant is committed to the custody of the Attorney

General or his designated representative for confinement in a

corrections facility separate, to the extent practicable, from

persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody

pending appeal.       The defendant shall be afforded a reasonable

opportunity for private consultation with defense counsel.               On

order of a court of the United States or on request of an

attorney for the Government, the person in charge of the

corrections facility shall deliver the defendant to the United

States Marshal for the purpose of an appearance in connection

with a court proceeding.

        SO ORDERED.
