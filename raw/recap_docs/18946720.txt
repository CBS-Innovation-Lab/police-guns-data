                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 09-cr-188-PB

John Selden

                                  O R D E R

     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

trial scheduled for July 7, 2010, citing the need for additional

time to finalize plea negotiations.          The government does not

object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reasons, the court will continue

the trial from July 7, 2010 to September 8, 2010.            In agreeing to

continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ยง

3161(h)(7)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the ends of

justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the best

interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.

     The June 21, 2010 final pretrial conference is continued to

August 30, 2010 at 2:30 p.m.         No further continuances.
