Gary Loranger

      The assented to motion to reschedule jury trial (document no.

39) filed by defendant Gary Loranger, with the assent of all

co-defendants, is granted; the continuance is limited to 60 days.

Trial is continued as to all defendants to the two-week period

beginning January 18, 2012, 9:30 AM.

rights within 10 days.       The court finds that the ends of justice

served by granting a continuance outweigh the best interest of the

public    and    the   defendant    in   a    speedy   trial,   18   U.S.C.   '

3161(h)(7)(B)(iv), for the reasons set forth in the motion.

      SO ORDERED.
