                   IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                     FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO


UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

       Plaintiff,

                   v.                             Criminal No. 18-363 (FAB)

VÍCTOR NATAL-RIVERA,

       Defendant.




                                         ORDER

      Pursuant    to     the    Fourth    Amendment      of     the       United   States

Constitution, defendant Víctor Natal-Rivera (“Natal”) moved to

suppress evidence seized by the Puerto Rico Police Department.

(Docket No. 20.)        The Court referred Natal’s motion to suppress to

Magistrate      Judge      Camille       Vélez-Rivé       for         a     report     and

recommendation (“R & R”).          The magistrate judge denied the motion

to   suppress    because       Natal   failed     to   attach    an       “affidavit   or

document setting forth or evidencing facts on which the motion is

based” in contravention of Local Rule 147(a) (“Rule 147(a)”).

(Docket No. 23.)        Natal objected to the R & R, asserting that “the

facts were based on the affidavit filed by the investigating

agent.”      (Docket No. 24 at p. 1.)

      This    Court     rejects    the    R   &    R   because    Rule       147(a)     is

inapplicable.      Rule 147(a) pertains to dispositive motions; it

provides that “[a]ffidavits and other documents setting forth or
Criminal No. 18-363 (FAB)                                            2

evidencing facts on which the motion is based shall be filed with

the motion.”   Loc. R. 147(a).   Natal’s motion to suppress seeks

the exclusion of evidence, the disposition of which does not

determine the outcome of this criminal action.    Consequently, the

R & R is misguided because Natal’s motion to suppress is not

dispositive within the meaning of Rule 147(a).

     The submission of an affidavit in conjunction with a motion

to suppress is permissive, not mandatory, pursuant to Federal Rule

of Criminal Procedure 47(a) (“Rule 47”).     Fed. R. Crim. P. 47(a).

Rule 47 states that a “motion may be supported by affidavit.”    Id.

(emphasis added); see United States v. Matías-Maestres, 738 F.

Supp. 2d 281, 285 (D.P.R. 2010) (Besosa, J.) (holding that the

“government incorrectly claims that [the defendant’s] affidavit is

necessary to file a motion to suppress properly”).      Accordingly,

this Court rejects the R & R, and refers this matter back to

Magistrate Judge Vélez-Rivé to hold a hearing and for an R & R

that is consistent with this Order.

     The jury trial scheduled to commence on August 1, 2018 is

VACATED.

     IT IS SO ORDERED.

     San Juan, Puerto Rico, July 30, 2018.
