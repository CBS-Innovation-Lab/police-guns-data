VII   COURT DETERMINATIONS OF RESTITUTION

      A    Qf    Restitution Not Appl icable.

      B    Total Amount of Restitution:

      C    Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

                 o	 For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
                      identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.SC § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

           2     0	   For offenses for which restitution is otherw ise mandatory under 18 U.S.C § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
                      issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims' losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
                      that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.SC § 3663A(c)(J)(B l.

                 o	 For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, reslitution is not
                      ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a resutution order outweigh
                      the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U.S C § 3663(a)( I)(B)(ii).
