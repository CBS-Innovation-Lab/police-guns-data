                             MEMORANDUM AND ORDER

WOLF, D.J.                                                  March 21, 2008

     Defendant Jeremias Guzman is serving a 210 month sentence for,

among other things, conspiring to distribute cocaine base.                As a

result of Amendment 706 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines

("U.S.S.G."), which generally retroactively reduces by two levels

the offense level for crimes involving crack cocaine and became

effective March 3, 2008, Guzman moved for a reduction of his

sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §3582(c)(2) and U.S.S.G. §2B1.10

(the "Motion").      As Guzman is indigent, counsel was appointed to

represent him. The government and counsel for the defendant have

conferred and filed a joint memorandum which addresses the Motion.

     The parties correctly agree that Guzman is eligible for a

reduction of his sentence.           They also agree that no hearing is

necessary or appropriate.          See Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(b)(4) (stating

that defendant need not be present for a reduction of sentence

under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)).         The government joins the defendant in

recommending      that    Guzman    receive   the   full   benefit   of    the

retroactive amendment because "neither considerations of public

safety, nor defendant's conduct while in the custody of the Bureau

of Prisons, warrants denial of the sentence reduction to which he

is   otherwise    entitled."      Joint     Memorandum   of    Government   and

Defendant    Regarding        Defendant's     Eligibility      for    Sentence

Modification and Joint Sentencing Recommendation at 5-6 n.2; see

also   U.S.S.G.    §1B1.10.    A.N.    1(B)(ii)   &   (iii).    The   Probation

Department states that Guzman has not incurred any disciplinary

infractions in the past five years, and is subject to immediate

deportation proceedings. Therefore, the parties request that to

implement their recommendation the court resentence the defendant

to "Time Served."

       The court agrees.      Therefore, it is hereby ORDERED that:

       1.   The Motion (Docket No. 122) is ALLOWED.

       2.   The defendant's sentence is REDUCED to Time Served.

       3.   The term and conditions of Supervised Release previously

imposed are not altered.

       4.   The   attached     Order    Regarding     Motion    for    Sentence

Reduction Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §3582(c)(2) and an Amended Judgment

shall enter forthwith.
