                     MOTION TO CONTINUE EMPANELMENT AND
                   ENLARGE TIME FOR FILING PRETRIAL MOTIONS

       Now comes the accused, Souvanh Keosouvanh, by and through his counsel, and moves this
Honorable Court to continue this matter currently scheduled for empanelment in October 2008 for
an additional thirty (30) days and to enlarge the time for filing pretrial motions for an additional
thirty (30) days as well.
       In support of this motion counsel states that the defendant remains at a facility for
determination of competence and the additional time is needed for the preparation of the report and
the final determination of competence.
       The Government and public will not be prejudiced by the delay, but will be benefitted by the
assurance that the criminal justice system is dedicated to fairness for all parties. As such, the
interests of justice in allowing this excludable time outweigh the interests of the public and the
defendant in a speedy trial. The time requested under this motion should be deemed excludable
under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 USC ยง 3161(h)(8).
       The Government, through Assistant United States Attorney Peter Neronha, indicates it has
no objection to the granting of this motion.

                                                     Respectfully submitted
                                                     Souvanh Keosouvanh
