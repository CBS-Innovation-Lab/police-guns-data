                            DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS



    UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
                                                Criminal No. 05-CR-10094
                   v.



           JEROME PENROSE



                        ASSENTED-TO MOTION TO CONTINUE

        Counsel hereby move that the Sentencing Hearing, presently scheduled for May 8, 2006

at 2:00 p.m., be continued until the week of May 22, 2006. In support of this motion, defense

counsel states that Ms. Tara Muise, girlfriend of Defendant and mother of Defendantâ€™s son,

Jayden Penrose, has a vacation planned for the week of May 8, 2006. Since the sentencing will

effect both the Defendant and Ms. Muise, who Defendant has an ongoing relationship with, we

ask that this hearing be rescheduled so that she may attend. Defense counsel has obtained the

assent of both AUSA Robert Richardson and Probation Officer Tricia Marcy.

                                          Respectfully submitted,

                                          JEROME PENROSE

                                          By his attorneys,
