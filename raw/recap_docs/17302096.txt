                            ORDER APPOINTING COUNSEL

       Before the Court is Defendant’s Pro Se Motion for Clarification of Sentence (Docket #

17). By this Order, the Court RESERVES RULING on the Motion and APPOINTS COUNSEL

to assist Defendant in connection with proceedings related to the Motion for Clarification of

Sentence.

       The Court takes this action after reviewing the Government’s Response (Docket # 20), in

which the Government indicates that the Defendant is in fact entitled to a clarification of his

sentence. As the Government indicates, in order for this Court to grant Defendant the relief he

seeks, the Court would need to convert Defendant’s Motion to a habeas petition pursuant to 28

U.S.C. §§ 2241 & 2255. Such a conversion may impact the Defendant’s ability to pursue any

habeas petition in the future and, thus, the Court believes it would be inappropriate to act on

Defendant’s Pro Se Motion without first giving him an opportunity to confer with counsel. See

28 U.S.C. §§ 2244(b) & 2255(h).

       Therefore, the Court hereby APPOINTS Attorney Matthew Erickson to represent the

Defendant in connection with the pending request for sentence clarification. Attorney Erickson

shall counsel Defendant on his options as they are laid out in the Government’s Response and
 Case 2:07-cr-00048-GZS Document 21 Filed 11/14/08 Page 2 of 2                    PageID #: 44



this Order. If Defendant determines that he wishes to pursue habeas relief before this Court,

Attorney Erickson shall file a separate habeas petition. In light of the Government’s apparent

agreement that the Court should order the federal sentence imposed in this case to be served

concurrent to the state sentences, the Court would act quickly on any petition filed. To the extent

Defendant chooses, after conferring with counsel, to pursue sentence clarification via the state

courts in order to preserve any rights he may have under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, Attorney Erickson

shall file a withdrawal of the pending Pro Se Motion.

       The Clerk is hereby directed to mail a copy of this Order to the Defendant.

       SO ORDERED.
