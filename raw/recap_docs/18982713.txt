        The assented to motion to reschedule jury trial (document no.

18) filed by defendant is granted; Trial is continued to the two-

week period beginning November 8, 2011, 9:30 AM.

days.    The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting

reasons set forth in the motion.

        SO ORDERED.
