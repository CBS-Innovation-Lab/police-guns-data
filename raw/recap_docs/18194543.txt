                     RECOMMENDED DECISION ON 28 U.S.C. § 2255 MOTION

        On July 11, 2016, Petitioner Eugene Allen filed a petition, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241,

in the Eastern District of North Carolina, Western Division.1 (Petition, ECF No. 1; Order, ECF

No. 9.) The North Carolina Court construed the petition as a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255,

added the United States as a respondent, and transferred the case to the District of Maine because

the motion challenges this Court’s sentence in Petitioner’s criminal case, docketed under the name

Eugene Erwin Allen, Jr., at No. 1:03-cr-00058-JAW. (Order at 1.) The Eastern District of North

Carolina determined that Petitioner must seek relief in this Court, or he must seek authorization

from the First Circuit Court of Appeals to file a second or successive section 2255 motion. (Id. at

4.)

        The First Circuit previously denied Petitioner’s request, which Petitioner based on Johnson

v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015), for permission to file a second or successive section 2255

motion to challenge the sentence. Allen v. United States, No. 16-1456 (1st Cir. June 23, 2016).

On that basis, this Court dismissed a prior section 2255 motion Petitioner filed in this Court.2

  The recommended decision, which recommended dismissal of the section 2255 motion, and the order adopting the

        In addition to citing Johnson, in his pending motion, Petitioner cites the United States

Supreme Court’s decision in Mathis v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2243 (2016), as a basis for relief.

Petitioner contends that based on Mathis, at least some of his prior convictions no longer qualify

as predicates under the Armed Career Criminal Act (18 U.S.C. § 924(3)). Petitioner thus argues

that his sentence is unlawful.

        The Supreme Court decided Mathis on June 23, 2016, which was the date of the First

Circuit’s judgment denying Petitioner’s request to file a second or successive motion. Given the

date of the Mathis decision and the date of the First Circuit decision, Petitioner did not raise and

the First Circuit did not address the Mathis decision when it denied Petitioner’s request to proceed

on a second or successive section 2255 motion.

        As the First Circuit has explained, this Court is without jurisdiction to consider Petitioner’s

second or successive section 2255 motion unless the motion is authorized by an appellate court:

“We have interpreted [section 2255(h)] as ‘stripping the district court of jurisdiction over a second

or successive habeas petition unless and until the court of appeals has decreed that it may go

forward.’” Trenkler v. United States, 536 F.3d 85, 96 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Pratt v. United

States, 129 F.3d 54, 57 (1st Cir. 1997)). A review of the record reveals Petitioner has not obtained

the First Circuit’s authorization to file a second or successive motion based on Mathis.

        Because the record lacks any evidence that the First Circuit has authorized Petitioner to

proceed on the pending motion, the Court is without jurisdiction to consider the merits of the

motion. First Circuit Rule 22.1(e) provides that if a second or successive section 2255 petition is

filed in the district court without the required authorization from the First Circuit, the district court

“will transfer the petition to the court of appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1631 or dismiss the

petition.”3 The issue, therefore, is whether the Court should dismiss or transfer the matter.

           Title 28 U.S.C. § 2255 provides:

             A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a motion under this section. The
             limitation period shall run from the latest of—

               (1) the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final;

               (2) the date on which the impediment to making a motion created by
             governmental action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States
             is removed, if the movant was prevented from making a motion by such
             governmental action;

               (3) the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme
             Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made
             retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or

               (4) the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could
             have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.


In citing Mathis, Petitioner presumably maintains he has one year from the date of the Mathis

decision (June 23, 2016) to file the instant motion. While “transfer may be preferable in some

    Title 28 U.S.C. § 1631 states:

           Whenever a civil action is filed in a court as defined in section 610 of this title or an appeal, including
           a petition for review of administrative action, is noticed for or filed with such a court and that court
           finds that there is a want of jurisdiction, the court shall, if it is in the interest of justice, transfer such
           action or appeal to any other such court in which the action or appeal could have been brought at
           the time it was filed or noticed, and the action or appeal shall proceed as if it had been filed in or
           noticed for the court to which it is transferred on the date upon which it was actually filed in or
           noticed for the court from which it is transferred.

First Circuit Rule 22.1(e) states:

           If a second or successive § 2254 or § 2255 petition is filed in a district court without the requisite
           authorization by the court of appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(3), the district court will
           transfer the petition to the court of appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1631 or dismiss the petition. If
           the petition is transferred, the petitioner must file a motion meeting the substantive requirements of
           Loc. R. 22.1(a) within 45 days of the date of notice from the clerk of the court of appeals that said
           motion is required. If the motion is not timely filed, the court will enter an order denying
           authorization for the § 2254 or § 2255 petition.


                                                                 3

situations in order to deal with statute of limitations problems or certificate of appealability issues,”

United States v. Barrett, 178 F.3d 34, 41 n.1 (1st Cir. 1999), given that Petitioner would have

nearly six months to seek permission from the First Circuit if he intends to pursue a second or

successive motion, and given that the First Circuit very recently considered and denied a request

from Petitioner to file a second or successive motion, dismissal is appropriate. Upon dismissal,

Petitioner can assess whether he wants to request the First Circuit’s authority to file a second or

successive motion and, if so, he can file an appropriate motion with the First Circuit in which he

sets forth the bases for his request.

                                            CONCLUSION

        Based on the foregoing analysis, I recommend the Court dismiss Petitioner’s section 2255

motion. (Petition, ECF No. 1.)          I further recommend that the Court deny a certificate of

appealability pursuant to Rule 11 of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Cases because there is no

substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. §

2253(c)(2).
