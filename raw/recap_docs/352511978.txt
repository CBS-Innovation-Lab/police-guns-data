                              MEMORANDUM & ORDER


 Mary S. McElroy, United States District Judge.

       Miguel E. Pavao was indicted on March 16, 2022, for possession of a firearm

 after a previous felony conviction. The firearm was seized during a search of his

 vehicle undertaken after a traffic stop for swerving between lanes. Mr. Pavao moved

 to suppress the firearm as the product of an unlawful frisk of his person during an

 unlawfully prolonged detention on the highway. The Court held an evidentiary

 hearing on May 15, 2023, at which Warwick Police Officer Connor R. Bemis, the

 officer responsible for the stop and frisk, testified. Based on Officer Bemis’ testimony,

 after hearing the arguments of counsel, and reaching conclusions on the mixed

 questions of law and fact presented, the Court GRANTS Mr. Pavao’s Motion to

 Suppress the firearm (ECF No. 18), all testimony about the firearm, the marijuana

 found by the police after a call for backup was made and any statements made by Mr.

 Pavao after that call.

                                      I.     FACTS

          The Court finds the testimony of Officer Bemis both straightforward and

 truthful and the facts found are based on his testimony. At 7:53 p.m. on February 6,

 2022, Officer Bemis stopped the car Mr. Pavao was driving because it was swerving.

 The vehicle stopped promptly when the cruiser’s lights were activated. A license plate

 check conducted as the officer pulled over came back negative for stolen vehicle. The

 officer then approached the passenger side of the car. Mr. Pavao was alone in the

 vehicle. Mr. Pavao, compliant and cooperative throughout the incident, produced a

 license and registration. 1    Almost immediately, the officer noticed the odor of

 marijuana.      Mr. Pavao’s hand was shaking, and he was chain-smoking cigarettes.

 Officer Bemis described the ensuing conversation this way: “I had asked him why he

 was swerving originally, and he said he had been reaching around or messing around

 with stuff inside the vehicle. He also informed me he had smoked a marijuana joint

 earlier in the day and was tired.” (Tr. at 11.) 2 The officer noticed residue on the

 floorboard, which Mr. Pavao identified as “marijuana crumbs.” (Tr. at 43.)

          At 7:55 p.m. – just two minutes after pulling the Pavao car over — Officer

 Bemis called for backup because he had decided to search the vehicle for additional

 contraband, and it was Warwick’s practice not to permit searches by officers who were

 alone. He testified that he “radioed for back up within a minute or two of [arriving



 1 The officer testified he did not want to leave Mr. Pavao in order to go back to the
 cruiser to verify the license and registration. He acknowledged he had the ability to
 make those checks from his portable radio, but he chose not to do so.

 2   The transcript has been filed with the Court.
                                             2
Case 1:22-cr-00034-MSM-PAS Document 33 Filed 06/09/23 Page 3 of 15 PageID #: 269




 at the passenger window],” Tr. at 11, which is consistent with the call for backup

 coming just two minutes after he radioed dispatch that he was stopping a vehicle. At

 about the same time, he testified, he saw Mr. Pavao reach down to the waistband of

 his pants as if to adjust his pants, “fidgeting with the waistline.” (Tr. at 15.) This

 was a gesture that Mr. Pavao repeated over the course of the seven or so minutes

 until another officer responded and Mr. Pavao was taken out of his vehicle. During

 that interval, while waiting for backup, Mr. Pavao pulled a baggie that appeared to

 contain marijuana out of his jacket, declaring something to the effect of “now you

 don’t need to search my car, here you go, something along those lines.” 3 (Tr. at 16.)

 As soon as Mr. Pavao was out of the vehicle, he was patted down, revealing a .40

 caliber semi-automatic pistol. The gun was seized, and he was arrested for possession

 of the weapon.

       Officer Bemis made it evident several times in his testimony that he could not

 recall when he saw Mr. Pavao fumble with his waistband in relation to the time he

 radioed for backup. Both events are important. It is the call for backup that indicates

 beyond doubt that the stop was extended for the purpose of searching the vehicle for

 contraband. The officer testified to that, and it is consistent with what he said was

 Warwick’s practice not to allow solo officers to conduct searches of vehicles. Second,

 it is the fumbling with the waistband that the government rests on to establish an

 objective fear for officer safety such that the frisk would be lawful under Terry v.



 3A second similar baggie of marijuana was discovered hidden in the vehicle during a
 subsequent full search of the car. The two baggies together weighed 1.1 oz.

 Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 21 (1968), and might serve as a basis for prolonging the stop. Officer

 Bemis testified several times about the timing, consistently choosing the words, “[at

 about] the same time.” (Tr. at 59.) But in response to the Court’s questioning, he

 acknowledged that it was the odor of marijuana and the crumbs that caused him to

 detain the car for a further search. 4

                                    II.   ANALYSIS

        Mr. Pavao puts forth two reasons why the seizure of the gun was

 unconstitutional. First, he maintains that instead of simply giving him a citation for

 erratic driving and permitting him to leave, the officer deliberately prolonged the stop

 in order to conduct a search of the vehicle unrelated to the mission of the stop. This

 would violate the proscriptions of Rodriguez v. United States, 575 U.S. 348, 350, 352

 (2015), which mandates that “a police stop exceeding the time needed to handle the

 matter for which the stop was made violates the Constitution’s shield against

 unreasonable seizures,” unless the additional time is supported by “reasonable

 suspicion” of another crime. Second, even if the stop were not unlawfully prolonged,

 Mr. Pavao contends that the pat-down of his person violated Terry because it was not



 4      THE COURT: So the waistband touching wasn’t part of you asking for backup
        to search the car. Your probable cause was the odor of marijuana and the
        crumbs on the floor?

        THE WITNESS: Originally, yes, and then it developed further.

        THE COURT: Okay. But originally.

        THE WITNESS: Originally, yes, your Honor.

 supported by an objectively reasonable fear for the officer’s safety. United States v.

 Harrington, 56 F.4th 195, 203-04 (1st Cir. 2022) (fear for safety is objective, not

 subjective).

          The burden here is on the government to justify, by a preponderance of the

 evidence, 5 both the detention and the frisk.       Whenever a search or seizure is

 performed without a warrant and on less than probable cause, “the government bears

 the burden of proving that the seizure was sufficiently limited in its nature and

 duration to satisfy the conditions of a Terry-type investigative stop.” United States

 v. Acosta-Colon, 157 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir. 1998).

          A. Prolonged Stop

          Officer Bemis’ testimony left no doubt that as soon as he saw Mr. Pavao’s hands

 shaking, smelled marijuana and saw crumbs on the floor, he made up his mind to

 search the vehicle: he called for backup and everything that happened next occurred

 only because he was waiting for backup to conduct the search. Because he had by

 that time completed the mission of the stop – which was for the driving infraction of

 swerving – the wait can be justified only by a reasonable suspicion that there was

 additional marijuana in the car which exceeded the 1 oz. demarcation between a civil

 and criminal violation. 6



 5   United States v. Matlock, 415 U.S. 164, 177 n.14 (1974).

 6 Rhode Island decriminalized marijuana in 2013. Ch. 12-221, amending R.I.G.L. §
 21-28-4.1(c)(2)(iii). While it remained against the law, the simple possession of less
 than 1 oz. became a civil infraction. Id. A lawful stop rests upon a reasonable
 suspicion “that the person apprehended is committing or has committed a criminal
 offense.” Arizona v. Johnson, 555 U.S. 323, 326 (2009) (emphasis supplied). Thus,
                                             5
Case 1:22-cr-00034-MSM-PAS Document 33 Filed 06/09/23 Page 6 of 15 PageID #: 272




       A seizure justified by the interest in issuing a ticket reaches the “unreasonable”

 point “if it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably required to complete that

 mission.” Illinois v. Caballes, 543 U.S. 405, 407 (2005). The brief questioning of Mr.

 Pavao by Officer Bemis after he first approached the passenger window was

 consistent with the stop for a traffic infraction. But nothing in those two minutes

 gave reason to believe Mr. Pavao was committing another crime. Compare United

 States v. Clark, 879 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2018) (the three differing dates of birth given

 by the driver led to outstanding warrants); United States v. Dunbar, 553 F.3d 48, 56

 (1st Cir. 2009) (inconsistent answers given by driver while officers were writing out

 the ticket revealed an expired license). Here, everything the officer learned in the

 two minutes before he decided to hold the vehicle for a full search was consistent with

 Mr. Pavao’s declaration that he had smoked a joint earlier in the day. That explained

 the odor of marijuana and the crumbs on the floor. Officer Bemis testified directly

 that he never put Mr. Pavao through a field sobriety test because he did not think he

 was operating under the influence. Clearly the Officer accepted that the odor was

 not connected to then-occurring use of marijuana, but to the past use that Mr. Pavao



 cause to suspect a civil infraction may not support a constitutional stop. The
 government defends the stop by pointing to the fact that possession of even residue
 remained a federal offense. But Officer Bevis made it clear that he was considering
 only a violation of state law; he testified that had Mr. Pavao had a medical marijuana
 card pursuant to R.I.G.L. § 21-28.6-4, he would have let him go without conducting
 a further search. Moreover, for every year since FY 2015, an appropriations rider has
 prohibited the Department of Justice from using taxpayer funds to enforce federal
 laws that conflict with state laws decriminalizing or legalizing marijuana, at least for
 medical purposes. See e.g., Consolidated Appropriation Act, 2023, H.R. 2617 (117th
 Congress).

Case 1:22-cr-00034-MSM-PAS Document 33 Filed 06/09/23 Page 7 of 15 PageID #: 273




 acknowledged. There was nothing at the time of the 7:55 p.m. call for backup to

 indicate that Mr. Pavao possessed any additional marijuana or that, if he did, the

 amount would exceed the 1 oz. that escalated a civil violation to a criminal offense.

       Contrary to the government’s assertion, this case is unlike United States v.

 Sanders, 248 F. Supp. 3d 339 (D.R.I. 2017), where another judge of this District

 upheld a continued detention in order to search a vehicle for contraband. There, the

 “totality of the circumstances” was fed by many factors not present here: in addition

 to the odor of marijuana and admission of smoking earlier in the evening, the

 defendant exhibited “furtive behavior when he moved from one seat to another while

 the car was still in motion,” the driver was “firmly clenching the steering wheel,” he

 was not simply nervous but “overly nervous,” there was an entire marijuana cigarette

 in the ashtray, the defendant kept fiddling with a GPS application on his cellphone,

 he “feign[ed] disinterest” in the interaction with the officer, and he was not wearing

 a jacket on a cool night. Id. at 347. Even these observations alone did not necessarily

 warrant prolonged detention: they justified the decision to “take a few minutes to

 run the BCI/III checks,” and it was “the extensive histories of each of the vehicle’s

 occupants” that provided enough support to hold the car in order to search it. Id. at

 347-48.

       The Court does not disagree with the Sanders court that the odor of marijuana

 is a relevant circumstance to be considered, along with others, in the determination

 of whether in the “totality of circumstances” there is reasonable suspicion to believe

 a crime is being committed. In Sanders there were numerous other factors; in this



                                           7
Case 1:22-cr-00034-MSM-PAS Document 33 Filed 06/09/23 Page 8 of 15 PageID #: 274




 case, there are none but the crumbs on the floor which are also consistent with

 smoking a joint earlier. 7   The government relies on United States v. Staula, 80 F.3d

 596, 602-03 (1st Cir. 1996). Staula indeed held that the mere odor of burnt marijuana

 justifies a full search of a vehicle, pursuant to which the car can presumably be

 detained. Staula was a 1996 case, nearly two decades before possession of small

 amounts of marijuana became decriminalized. While this Court would not lightly

 chart a course deviant from a First Circuit case, decriminalization puts the whole

 “odor of marijuana” in a different light. A search of a vehicle requires probable cause

 to believe criminal activity is “afoot.” The smell of burnt marijuana no more indicates

 that an unlawful amount of marijuana is possessed than it does that only one joint is

 in the car – or, more accurately, was in the car at the time it was smoked. Yet if there

 is not reasonable suspicion of more than 1 oz. in the car at the time of this stop, there

 was no criminal activity afoot at all.



 7
  The Court finds United States v. Thompson, No. 12-10365, 2014 WL 108312 (D.
 Mass. 2014), cited by the government, unpersuasive. That Court held that the odor
 of marijuana justified a prolonged detention at a time when, according to the
 government, small amounts of marijuana had been decriminalized. The Court is not
 inclined to agree with Thompson for several reasons. First, for support, it cited
 Flowers v. Fiore, 359 F.3d 24, 30-31 (1st Cir. 2004), but there was no marijuana, or
 odor of marijuana, in the Flowers case. Flowers involved the constitutionality of a
 stop, frisk and brief detention in a situation in which police received a report of a
 threat to send two African-American men with guns to someone’s house, an
 observation of two African-American men driving past the house in a small gray or
 black vehicle, the stop of two men matching the description in a small gray vehicle
 within a few minutes after the report, about a half mile away from the residence.
 Second, the decision in Thompson to prolong the stop was made not on the odor of
 marijuana alone, but “also when coupled with information about the [significant]
 criminal histories of [the two occupants], …” which included “gangs and guns” for one
 of them. Third, the Thompson opinion does not address, or even note, the impact of
 decriminalization.
                                             8
Case 1:22-cr-00034-MSM-PAS Document 33 Filed 06/09/23 Page 9 of 15 PageID #: 275




       Officer Bemis testified that it was his practice to search for additional

 marijuana every time he found any marijuana at all, if the subject lacked a medical

 marijuana card. 8 (Tr. at 62.) He justified it by saying he couldn’t know without

 searching whether the suspect possessed an unlawful amount. Id. The law, however,

 does not authorize a search because the officer “doesn’t know” whether a person

 possesses contraband. That rationale, if allowed, would support a search of the

 person, or the vehicle, of everyone who possessed the permitted and thoroughly

 noncriminal amount of less than 1 oz. of marijuana. 9 “Reasonable suspicion” by its

 very terms required Officer Bemis to have at minimum a suspicion of criminal

 possession of marijuana, not simply a failure to have any idea whether Mr. Pavao

 possessed a criminal quantity or not. Continued detention must be “independently

 supported by individualized suspicion” of criminal activity. Rodriguez, 575 U.S. at

 357. The fact that Mr. Pavao’s hands were shaking, or that he appeared nervous,

 adds nothing to the reasonable suspicion equation. It is not uncommon for those

 stopped by police to exhibit nervousness. See United States v. Garcia, 53 F. Supp.

 502, 511 (D.N.H. 2014) (unlawful prolonging of stop based on defendant’s

 nervousness and officer’s skepticism of his story that he and the passenger were on a

 “test drive” to check out a car repair). “Nervousness is a common and entirely natural



 8 The officer in his testimony seemed to recognize the inconsistency between
 assuming a possessor of marijuana who lacked a card might be carrying more than
 the 1 oz. permitted, but not assuming a possessor of a card might be carrying more
 than the quantity authorized by the card. (Tr. at 62-63.)

 9 Rhode Island has now gone further and legalized recreational marijuana. R.I.G.L.
 § 21-28-4.01(c)(2)(iv), (v).
                                           9
Case 1:22-cr-00034-MSM-PAS Document 33 Filed 06/09/23 Page 10 of 15 PageID #: 276




  reaction to police presence, …” United States v. McKoy, 428 F.3d 38, 40 (1st Cir.

  2005). “A person stopped by the police is entitled to be nervous without thereby

  suggesting he is armed and dangerous or, indeed, has anything to hide.” United

  States v. Spinner, 475 F.3d 356, 360 (D.C. Cir. 2007). Mr. Pavao’s nervousness was

  not accompanied by aggression or suspicious movements. See United States v. Orth,

  873 F.3d 349, 352 (1st Cir. 2017) (prolonging detention was reasonable where

  occupants exhibited abnormal nervousness, like “deer-in-the-headlights,” and the

  driver would not open glove compartment or produce registration, would not identify

  a “large black” object between his leg and the console, and became verbally

  aggressive). Nor was it accompanied by an unwillingness to provide identification.

  See United States v. Chaney, 584 F.3d 20, 26 (1st Cir. 2009) (reasonable suspicion to

  prolong stop where, in addition to nervousness, the defendant gave implausible

  answers raising a suspicion of having given a false name). Nor did Mr. Pavao

  “adjusting” his waistband add anything. At that point, he had touched his waistband

  only once and, indeed, Officer Bemis was already on his radio calling for backup,

  having made the decision to hold the vehicle to search it.

        Officer Bemis had no lawful basis to prolong the stop. 10 Mr. Pavao’s response

  to the prolonged detention, of throwing out a baggie of marijuana, cannot therefore

  be the basis of cause to continue to hold the vehicle for a further search.



  10The parties have brought to the Court’s attention State v. Junjie Li, R.I. Super.,
  K2-2019-1532A (ECF No. 18-2), currently pending on appeal in the Rhode Island
  Supreme Court. In Junjie, a Rhode Island Superior Court justice, acknowledging the
  national sea change of decriminalization and legalization of recreational marijuana,
  and analyzing the effect of that transformation of the contraband landscape upon the
                                             10
Case 1:22-cr-00034-MSM-PAS Document 33 Filed 06/09/23 Page 11 of 15 PageID #: 277




        B. The Frisk (pat-down)

        Even if the prolonged detention were lawful, that is insufficient to justify the

  frisk. United States v. Wetmore, 560 F. Supp. 3d 591, 601-02 (D.N.H. 2021), app. vol.

  dism., No. 21-1449, 2021 WL 6101509 (1st Cir. Aug. 25, 2021) (“T]here must be a

  separate analysis of whether the standard for pat-frisks has been met.”). The issue

  here is whether the totality of circumstances would have caused a reasonable police

  officer to fear for his safety, the standard for justifying a pat-down. United States v.

  Sanchez, 817 F.3d 38, 42 (1st Cir. 2016) (“totality of circumstances.”); United States

  v. Cardona-Vincente, 817 F.3d 823, 827 (1st Cir. 2016) (same). Officer Bemis never

  articulated a belief that his safety was in jeopardy; he simply reported that he was

  unsure what Mr. Pavao’s frequent touching of his waistband meant.              But the

  standard is not what the arresting officer subjectively believes; it is the objective

  question of what a reasonable officer would believe. United States v. Guerrero, 19

  F.4th 547, 557 (1st Cir. 2021). The Court finds there were no circumstances here

  prior to the frisk being carried out that would raise any suspicion that Mr. Pavao was

  armed.

        There was nothing in his speech or behavior that was aggressive or

  threatening, from which one might infer he could be violent. On the contrary, he was




  requirements of the Fourth Amendment, held that the odor of marijuana plus
  nervousness does not provide a basis to prolong a traffic stop in order to conduct a
  further search. Id. at 19. Junjie shares a factual similarity with this case: there,
  the officer called for a drug-sniffing canine to respond to the scene, signaling the
  conversion of the stop from a traffic violation to an investigation for something else.
  Similarly, the call by Officer Bemis for backup had the same legal meaning.
                                            11
Case 1:22-cr-00034-MSM-PAS Document 33 Filed 06/09/23 Page 12 of 15 PageID #: 278




  compliant, cooperative and, while nervous, not agitated. Officer Bemis testified “he

  was very polite, no aggressive actions or anything.”         He was not suspected of

  committing a violent crime, which itself would be reason to think he might be armed.

  See United States v. Belin, 868 F.3d 43, 49 (1st Cir. 2017) (quoting United States v.

  Scott, 270 F.3d 30, 41 (1st Cir. 2001)) (“[w]hen the officer suspects a crime of violence,

  the same information that will support an investigatory stop will without more

  support a frisk.”). There was nothing about the location in which he was stopped that

  might indicate gang or other criminal activity. Compare United States v. Am, 564

  F.3d 25, 30-31 (1st Cir. 2009) (officers also knew of defendant’s gang activity and

  uncharacteristic behavior in location of known gang activity). Police had received no

  information about him indicating he might be armed, as in United States v. Brake,

  666 F.3d 800, 805 (1st Cir. 2011), where, in addition to suspicious conduct reaching

  into or retrieving something from their van, the two men had been reported to be

  engaging in menacing behavior with a gun by a resident in the house they were

  apparently leaving. Mr. Pavao touching his waistband even several times was not a

  threatening gesture, nor one indicative of a person with a weapon, although Officer

  Bemis was concerned enough to tell Mr. Pavao to stop. The officer testified that a

  suspect’s “rapidly staring, you know, at a particular target area multiple times” (Tr.

  at 17) can be a sign of a weapon, but he testified that Mr. Pavao “target glanced his

  waistband” only “at one point.” Id. He unhesitatingly put his hands on his head

  when requested to do so. Officer Bemis testified that the “repeated motions for the

  waistband” made him concerned, Tr. at 19, but that concern must be supported by



                                             12
Case 1:22-cr-00034-MSM-PAS Document 33 Filed 06/09/23 Page 13 of 15 PageID #: 279




  specific behavior that would cause a reasonable officer to believe Mr. Pavao was

  armed.

        The Court recognizes the line of cases that rely on a presumption that those

  who engage in drugs can be presumed to be armed. United States v. McCoy, 773 Fed.

  Appx. 164, 165 (4th Cir. 2019) (per curiam). The Court finds that presumption

  inappropriate here for several reasons. First, in many cases there are other indicia

  of dangerousness. In McCoy itself, the officer knew the defendant had been twice

  convicted previously of armed robbery. United States v. McCoy, No. 3:17-cr-00240-

  MOC-DSC, 2018 WL 1144591, *1 (W.D.N.C. Mar. 2, 2018). Second, the First Circuit

  has not relied on such a presumption. Very recently, in United States v. Harrington,

  56 F.4th 195 (1st Cir. 2022), notwithstanding that the defendant appeared under the

  influence of opioids and admitted he had drugs on his person, the Court examined

  whether there were objective and particularized facts to support a reasonable

  suspicion that Harrington was armed and dangerous. While the Court noted a

  common association between drug transactions and weapons, it relied on

  Harrington’s noncompliance with an order to place his hands on top of his head, his

  motions instead toward his pocket, and his reaching back into the car for something

  near the center console after he was removed from the vehicle. 11 Those specific and

  articulable facts “would reasonably warrant the pat-frisk given fear for officer safety.”




  11According to the district court, Harrington was also trying to reach for something
  on the floor area. United States v. Harrington, 557 F. Supp. 3d 323, 335 (D.N.H.
  2021).

  Id. at 204. In contrast here, even though by the time of the frisk Mr. Pavao had

  touched his waistband several times, he complied with an order to place his hands on

  his head, and he neither reached for any object nor even put his hand inside his

  waistband as if to retrieve an object.

        Third, such a presumption, if reasonable, attaches to “large-scale trafficking in

  illegal drugs” – crimes that “are ‘associated with’” violence. Belin, 868 F.3d at 50. It

  is the dealing in drugs that is associated with violence and weapons. Id. (noting the

  connection to “street-dealer-level transactions, at least where the suspect also

  appeared unusually anxious at the time of the stop.”).

        Finally, the legitimacy of any presumption that a person who acknowledged

  smoking a joint of marijuana earlier and who dropped residue on the car’s floorboards,

  is armed and dangerous, must today be in question.            In 2013, Rhode Island

  decriminalized the possession of less than 1 oz. of marijuana, held for personal

  recreational use. Thus, persons in possession of small amounts of marijuana were

  not, at the time of this incident, engaging in any criminal behavior at all. And as

  recreational marijuana dispensaries have been licensed in nearby Massachusetts

  since 2018, persons smoking a joint could not be presumed to have obtained their

  marijuana through illicit means. Thus, employing a presumption that Mr. Pavao was

  armed and dangerous simply from his personal marijuana use has no logic to

  recommend it.

        Accepting the facts testified to by Officer Bemis, the Court finds there were no

  circumstances justifying the frisk of Mr. Pavao and therefore GRANTS his Motion to

  Suppress on that basis as well.


        The lawful stop conducted by Officer Bemis was unlawfully prolonged from the

  moment he called for backup and began to detain the vehicle in order to search for

  marijuana. The frisk was unlawful as it was not based on facts that would cause a

  reasonably prudent officer to fear for his safety. For both those reasons, or for either

  independently, Mr. Pavao’s Motion to Suppress (ECF No. 18) is GRANTED.


  IT IS SO ORDERED:
