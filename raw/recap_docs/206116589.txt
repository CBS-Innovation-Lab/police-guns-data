TRAVIS LEEMAN                                 )


               EMERGENCY MOTION FOR RELEASE ON CONDITIONS

       Now comes the defendant, by and through counsel, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 3142 and
3143 and asks the Court to release Travis Leeman on Conditions pending the April 4, 2022
Hearing on the Pending Release Motion (ECF # 75).


       In support and explanation of this Motion, counsel provides the following:


1.     On April 18, 2022, counsel for Travis Leeman filed a Motion for Release On
Conditions noting that Leeman was scheduled to complete the residential aspect of the
treatment program on May 4, 2022. Today at around 1:45 p.m. counsel was notified by the
Program that Leeman has completed the residential aspect of the program as of last night.
Leeman left a voice message for counsel who was on an overnight flight and scheduled be
off today. Counsel came to the office around 1 today and followed up with the treatment
program, Leeman and Probation Officer Entwistle. Leeman had been at treatment pursuant
to the Court’s Order of Limited Temporary Release. ECF # 70, 3/7/22. Under the current
Order, upon completion of the Program, Leeman must return to the Cumberland County Jail.
Id. ¶ 5.


2.         As explained in the initial motion of April 18, 2022, counsel has discussed a re-entry
plan with Supervising Officer Megan Entwistle who agrees Leeman appears ready to reside

                                                  1
in the community under conditions of release. The Court had set a release hearing for
Wednesday, May 4 at 12:30. Leeman has a safe place to live that has been approved by
probation. Leeman is presently at that location.


3.     Probation through Officer Megan Entwistle and the Government through A.U.S.A.
Jeanne Semivan have no objection to this emergency motion which we understand covers
only the period from now until the hearing on May 4.


       Wherefore we ask the court to enter an order releasing Leeman on the previously
proposed Conditions of Release effective immediately, subject to review at the scheduled in
person hearing on May 4, 2022.
