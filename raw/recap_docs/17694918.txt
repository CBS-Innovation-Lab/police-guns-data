                        RECOMMENDED DECISION ON MOTION

       James Cruz has filed what he calls a “motion filed pursuant to Title 28 U.S.C. §

2255(f)(3)” seeking to reopen his original § 2255 petition. Cruz filed the original petition on

April 24, 2000, and the Court denied it without an evidentiary hearing on the basis of the

recommendation of United States Magistrate Judge Cohen. Magistrate Judge Cohen’s

unpublished recommended decision, dated October 4, 2000, can be accessed on this Court’s

website in the index of his opinions for the year 2000. The recommendation was twenty-one

pages in length and addressed the substantive merits of the grounds raised by Cruz in his original

§ 2255 petition. It cannot be disputed but that Cruz has already filed a first motion to vacate his

conviction and thus the motion to “reopen” is actually a second or successive petition under 28

U.S.C. § 2255(h).

       Cruz argues that the motion to reopen is timely filed because it was filed within one year

after the date on which a right was initially recognized by the Supreme Court and made

retroactive to cases on collateral review under 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f)(3). Cruz relies upon the

opinion in DePierre v. United States, 131 S. Ct. 2225 (June 9, 2011), in which the Supreme

Court held that the term “cocaine base” in a federal drug statute means not just crack cocaine, but

includes all forms of cocaine in its chemically basic form. Cruz says this holding has retroactive

application to his sentence. Even if there were some validity to the argument that this Supreme

Court opinion applies retroactively to Cruz’s conviction and sentence, and that this “motion” was

timely filed, this Court could not simply “reopen” a twelve year old judgment under § 2255.

Nothing in the motion suggests that the original judgment could be reopened under any provision

of Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Munoz v. United States, 331 F.3d

151, 152-53 (1st Cir. 2003) (limiting the use of a Rule 60(b) motion in the context of § 2255

petitions to only those motions that attack the manner in which the earlier judgment was

procured).

       Judgment entered in the underlying criminal case on October 6, 1997. The First Circuit

concluded its direct review in 1998. United States v. Cruz, 156 F.3d 22 (1st Cir. 1998). Since

that time Cruz has filed a number of motions attempting to have the judgment reconsidered,

amended, or otherwise vacated. Those efforts have all been unsuccessful, most notably Cruz’s

attempt in 2010 to obtain leave from the First Circuit to file a second or successive petition based

upon the Supreme Court’s decision in Begay v. United States, 553 U.S. 137 (2008). In re:

James Cruz, No. 10-1332 (1st Cir., April 6, 2010) (see United States v. Cruz, No. 1:96-cr-00076-

GC (D. Me.): ECF No. 164.) It would appear that Cruz’s efforts to obtain review in this

instance suffer from the same infirmity as in 2010, i.e., the rule in question is one of statutory

interpretation, not constitutional law. As matters now stand this court lacks jurisdiction to hear

this motion to reopen under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2244(a), 2255(h) and Pratt v. United States, 129 F.3d

54 (1st Cir. 1997). See id. at 75 (“AEDPA’s prior approval provision allocates subject-matter

jurisdiction to the court of appeals by stripping the district court of jurisdiction over a second or

successive habeas petition unless and until the court of appeals has decreed that it may go

forward.”).

                                            Conclusion

       For the reasons above I recommend that the Court summarily dismiss without prejudice

this 28 U.S.C. § 2255 motion to reopen and recommend that the Court deny Cruz a certificate of

appealability in the event he should file a Notice of Appeal.
