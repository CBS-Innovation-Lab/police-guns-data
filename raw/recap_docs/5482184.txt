STATEMENT OF REASONS

VII COURT DETERM[INATIONS OF RESTITUT-ION
A M Restitution Not Applicable.
B Total Aniount of Restitution:

C Restitution not ordered (Check only one .):

l i:i For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under iii U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

2 i:] For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S_C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims_’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(B).
3 m F or other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U. S. C. § 3663 and/'or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh

the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U S. C. § 3663(a)(1)(B)(11)

4 i:l Restitution is not ordered for other reasons. (Explain.)

D L__l Paitiai restitution is ordered for these reasons (18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)):
