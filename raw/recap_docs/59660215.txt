STATEMENT OF REASONS
VII COURT DE'I`ERMlNATIONS OF RESTI'I`U'I`ION
A m Restitution Not Applicable.
B Total Amount of Restitution:
C Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):
l m For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S.Ci § 3663A(c){3)(A)_
2 [:I For offenses f`or which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. §3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex

issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount ofthe viciims’ losses would complicate or prolong thc sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(B).

3 [] For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not

ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh

the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U S.C. § 3663(a)(1)(B)(t'i).

4 l:l Restitution is notordered forotherreasons (Expiain)
