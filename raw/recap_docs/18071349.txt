              ORDER ON REQUEST FOR EARLY TERMINATION
                      OF SUPERVISED RELEASE


      I have considered carefully Mr. Davisâ€™s request for early termination of his

supervised release. I congratulate Mr. Davis on the progress he has made while

in prison and on supervised release, but it is still too early to end his supervision.

The request is DENIED, but   WITHOUT PREJUDICE     to its renewal at a later date.

      SO ORDERED.

      DATED THIS 1ST DAY OF DECEMBER, 2015
