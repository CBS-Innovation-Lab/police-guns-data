                   UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                        DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

              v.                             Case No. 05-cr-46-01-SM

Steven Hall

                                    ORDER

      Defendant Hall’s motion to continue the final pretrial conference and trial

is granted (document 13). Trial has been rescheduled for the November 2006

trial period. Defendant Hall shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights not later

than October 10, 2006. On the filing of such waiver, his continuance shall be

effective.

      The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18

U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would

unreasonably deny defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances.

      Final Pretrial Conference: November 2, 2006 at 3:00 p.m.

      Jury Selection: November 7, 2006 at 9:30 a.m.
