                          MEMORANDUM & ORDER

GORTON, J.

     On January 11, 2013, this Court adopted a Report and

Recommendation dismissing the habeas petition of Julio Carrion

Santiago (“Santiago”).    The Court now addresses whether Santiago

is eligible for a Certificate of Appealability.

I.   Background

     On October 27, 2006, Santiago was convicted after a ten-day

jury trial of conspiracy to distribute heroin and to possess

heroin with intent to distribute under 21 U.S.C. §§ 846,

841(b)(1), possessing firearms in furtherance of a drug

trafficking crime under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) and of possession of

unregistered firearms under 26 U.S.C. § 5861(d).       The jury also

found that the conspiracy involved at least one kilogram of

heroin.   This Court sentenced Santiago to 248 months’


                                  -1-
imprisonment.

      In his habeas petition, Santiago challenged his conviction

on the grounds that he was deprived of his Sixth Amendment right

to effective assistance of counsel and challenges the sentence

that was imposed by the Court.   This Court denied relief on those

grounds and dismissed his petition.

II.   Legal Analysis

      A.   Standard

      Section 2253(c) of Title 28 of the United States Code

provides that a Certificate of Appealability may issue “only if

the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a

constitutional right.” 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).    In order to make

a “substantial showing,” a petitioner seeking a Certificate of

Appealability must demonstrate that

      reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that
      matter, agree that) the petition should have been
      resolved in a different manner or that the issues
      presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to
      proceed further.

Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000).    The debatable-among

jurists-of-reason standard is a low barrier.    A claim is

considered “debatable” even if every reasonable jurist would

agree that the petitioner will not prevail. Miller-El v.

Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 338 (2003).    The petitioner must,

however, prove “something more than the absence of frivolity or

the existence of mere good faith.” Id.    When a habeas petition


                                 -2-
contains more than one potential ground for relief, a court must

state which issues, if any, satisfy the standard set forth in

§ 2253(c)(2). 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(3).

     B.      Application

     Santiago claims that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right

to effective assistance of counsel when his attorney failed to

introduce evidence challenging the weapons offense and failed to

subpoena the government’s chemist who was responsible for

preparing the report used to establish the nature and quantity of

the drugs seized.     Santiago claims that it was both ineffective

assistance and a violation of his rights under Brady for the

government to fail to disclose information that it allegedly held

regarding the criminal activities of a now disbarred attorney.

The subject attorney, John M. Cicilline (“John M.”), who is the

son of defense counsel, Attorney John F. Cicilline (“John F.”),

allegedly bribed a police officer not to testify in defendant’s

case.     Furthermore, Santiago challenges the application of a

five-year mandatory minimum consecutive sentence with respect to

the gun charge against him.

     This Court agreed with the Report and Recommendation of the

Magistrate Judge and adopted the following reasons for denying

all of Santiago’s claims: first, it was not unreasonable for

defense counsel to choose not to pursue a speculative line of

questioning at trial regarding the possibility that the firearm,


                                  -3-
discovered in the attic of defendant’s residence, could have been

placed there by someone else; second, defense counsel’s strategic

decision to stipulate to the admission of the report of a

forensic chemist, prior to the Supreme Court’s decision in

Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305 (2009), was not

unreasonable nor prejudicial; third, even assuming John M. was

involved in defendant’s case, defendant failed to demonstrate how

evidence of John M.’s actions was either exculpatory or

prejudicial to his defense; and fourth, defendant waived his

challenge to his sentence by failing to raise it on direct

appeal.

     Having considered its earlier findings for a second time,

the Court concludes that reasonable jurists could not debate the

outcome and a certificate of appealability is inappropriate.

                              ORDER

     In accordance with the foregoing, petitioner’s motion for a

Certificate of Appealability is DENIED.



So ordered.
