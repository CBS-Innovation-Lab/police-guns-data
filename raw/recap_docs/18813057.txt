                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                       DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

             v.                              Case No. 07-cr-53-01-SM

Timothy McComas-Lowe

                                      ORDER

      Defendant McComas-Lowe’s motion to continue the final pretrial

conference and trial is granted (document 7). Trial has been rescheduled for

the June 2007 trial period. Defendant McComas-Lowe shall file a waiver of

speedy trial rights not later than March 27, 2006. On the filing of such waiver,

his continuance shall be effective.

      The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18

U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would

unreasonably deny defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances.

      Final Pretrial Conference: May 23, 2007 at 4:30 p.m.

      Jury Selection: June 5, 2007 at 9:30 a.m.
