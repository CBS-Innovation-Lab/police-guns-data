                      DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

            v.                          Criminal N o . 09-cr-57-01-JD

Richard Pelkey


                                O R D E R


      The assented to motion to reschedule jury trial (document n o .

15) filed by defendant is granted; the continuance is limited to

one year.

      Defendant shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights within 10

days. The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting

a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), for the

reasons set forth in the motion.

      SO ORDERED.



                                        /s/ Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr.
