l ij For oi`i`enses t`or which restitution is otherwise tnandator}r under 18 U.S.C. §36(13!\‘ restitution is not ordered because the number of

l:l For ol`l`enses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.(`.. § 36()3/\, restitution is not ordered because determining complex

issues oi` fact and relating them to the cause or amount ofthe victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.(`. § 3063)’\(¢}{3){3).

3 l:l For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 li.S.C`. § 3663 andfor required by the sentencing guidelines restitution is not
