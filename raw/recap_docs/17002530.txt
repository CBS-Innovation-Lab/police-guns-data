     ORDER AFFIRMING RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE



       The United States Magistrate Judge filed with the court on January 19,

2006, with copies to counsel, his Recommended Decision on Motions to

Suppress. The defendant filed his objection to the Recommended Decision on

March 31, 2006, having been granted an extension of time to do so.

       Upon de novo review and after reading the entire transcript of the

evidentiary hearing before Magistrate Judge Cohen, I accept his recommended

decision on the defendant’s motions to suppress.

       I DENY the defendant’s request for an additional evidentiary hearing to

present the testimony of two of his younger siblings.   This is not a case like

United States v. Gabriel, 405 F. Supp.2d 50, 52-53 n.3 (D. Me. 2005), where

Judge Woodcock heard additional evidence when the government informed him

that evidence it had presented previously was incorrect.      Here, there was
Case 2:05-cr-00069-DBH Document 69 Filed 04/14/06 Page 2 of 2        PageID #: 549



abundant opportunity to present all the relevant evidence at the original hearing

before Judge Cohen. The testimony in question would be cumulative; from the

affidavits, it appears to be designed to challenge a particular factual finding that

Judge Cohen made, a finding that the defendant finds objectionable (whether law

enforcement directed the defendant to sit on a stone wall). See Def.’s Objections

to Recommended Decision at 6-7 (Docket Item 65); Jenny Poland Aff. ¶ 4; Shelby

Poland Aff. ¶ 4. Even were I to hear the additional evidence and credit it, it would

not change the correctness of the Recommended Decision.

      I have also considered the impact of Georgia v. Randolph, 126 S. Ct. 1515

(2006), a Supreme Court opinion that issued after Judge Cohen’s decision.

Randolph does not change the outcome, because I find here that both the

defendant and his parents consented to the entry and search.

      The motions to suppress are therefore DENIED.

      SO ORDERED.

      DATED THIS 14TH DAY OF A PRIL, 2006
