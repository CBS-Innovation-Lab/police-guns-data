                      ORDER AFFIRMING THE RECOMMENDED
                       DECISION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE

       On November 30, 2009, Mary Chase, acting pro se, moved for an order granting early

release. Def.’s Mot. for Order Granting Early Release (Docket # 129). The Court referred her

motion to the Magistrate Judge for recommended decision and on January 4, 2010, the

Magistrate Judge issued her Recommended Decision, recommending that the motion either be

denied or dismissed so that it could be brought in the venue where Ms. Chase is currently

imprisoned. Recommended Dec. at 6 (Docket # 130). Objections were due on January 21, 2010,

but Ms. Chase failed to file a timely objection and on January 25, 2010, the Court affirmed the

Recommended Decision. Order Affirming the Recommended Dec. of the Magistrate Judge

(Docket # 132).

       Later that same day, Ms. Chase filed a motion asking the Court to extend the time for her

objections to the Recommended Decision to February 22, 2010.           Def.’s Mot. Requesting

Extension of Time to Resp. to U.S. Magistrate Judge’s Recommended Dec. (Docket # 133). The

Court granted her motion for extension, but only to February 12, 2010. Order Granting Mot. for

Extension (Docket # 134). In excess of caution, the Court waited until February 22, 2010, the

date Ms. Chase had requested for an extension, before ruling on her objection to the

Recommended Decision. Ms. Chase has failed, however, to file her memorandum within either

the time allowed by the Court or the time she herself requested.

       Although Ms. Chase objected to the Magistrate Judge’s Recommended Decision, she has

failed to explain the basis for her objection.       The Court has reviewed and considered the

Magistrate Judge’s Recommended Decision, together with the entire record, and has made a de

novo determination of all matters adjudicated by the Magistrate Judge’s Recommended Decision.

For the reasons set forth in her Recommended Decision dated January 4, 2010, the Court adopts

the Magistrate Judge’s Recommended Decision.

       In the Recommended Decision, the Magistrate Judge suggested the Court adopt one of

two alternatives: either deny Ms. Chase’s motion on the merits or dismiss her motion because of

improper venue. The effect of the denial would be preclusive; the effect of the dismissal would

allow Ms. Chase to initiate a new motion in the district where she is currently incarcerated.

Based on its review of the Magistrate Judge’s well reasoned opinion, the Court has reservations

about the merits of Ms. Chase’s position, but in the exercise of discretion, concludes that it is

wiser to allow Ms. Chase (if she chooses to do so) to present her argument to a court in an

appropriate venue than to foreclose her from making the argument at all.

       It is hereby ORDERED that the Defendant’s Motion for Order Granting Early Release

Eligibility (Docket # 129) be and hereby is DISMISSED as it should have been brought as a

motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 in the venue where the Defendant is currently imprisoned.

       SO ORDERED.


                                             /s/ John A. Woodcock, Jr.

                                             CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
