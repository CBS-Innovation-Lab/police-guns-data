                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE




United States of America

     v.                                       Criminal No.   09-cr-76-01-B

Brian Fantry



                                  O R D E R


     The defendant has moved to continue the August 18, 2009

trial in the above case.        Defendant cites the need for additional

time to complete plea negotiations.          The government does not

object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, in order to allow the parties additional time

to complete plea negotiations and properly prepare for trial, the

court will continue the trial from August 18, 2009 to September

1, 2009.      In agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds

pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. § 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated

reasons, the ends of justice served in granting a continuance

outweigh the best interests of the public and the defendant in a

speedy trial.
