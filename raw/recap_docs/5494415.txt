UNITED STATES

V.                                                              CR. NO. 04-CR-10336-NMG

SANTIAGO ARROYO


                            DEFENDANT’S SENTENCING MEMORANDUM


         Defendant Santiago Arroyo, by his attorney, submits the following memorandum in support

of his request that he be sentenced to time served, three years supervised released, and no fine based

on his indigency.1

         Mr. Arroyo submits that as the least culpable person charged in this conspiracy, whose only

involvement was to deliver drugs on December 10, 2003, he should receive a mitigating role

adjustment of two levels per §3B1.2(a) as a minor participant.

         Application note 3(A) makes clear that this mitigating role adjustment is properly applied to

Mr. Arroyo. “A defendant who is accountable under §1B1.3 only for the conduct in which the

defendant personally was involved and who performs a limited function in concerted criminal

activity is not precluded from consideration for an adjustment under this guideline. For example, a

defendant who is convicted of a drug trafficking offense, whose role in that offense was limited to

transporting or storing drugs and who is accountable under §1B1.3 only for the quantity of drugs the

defendant personally transported or stored is not precluded from consideration for an adjustment

under this guideline.” This is exactly Mr. Arroyo’s position. The probation office rejected Mr.

Arroyo’s assertion that he receive this reduction, for the reason that he is being held accountable only

for the drugs involved on December 10, 2003. As note 3(A) explains, he is not disqualified for the

reduction on this basis. There can be no claim that Mr. Arroyo is anything but the least culpable


1 Mr. Santiago is expected to satisfy criterion 5 of §5C1.2(a), the safety valve, prior to sentencing on January 10,
2007. The memorandum assumes Mr. Santiago qualifies for safety valve reductions.

person in this conspiracy. He should be deemed a minor participant and his offense level decreased

by 2 levels.

         The advisory guideline sentencing range, assuming a minor role adjustment is based on

offense level 8, 0-6 months.

         The advisory guideline sentencing range, if Mr. Arroyo does not receive the mitigating role

adjustment is based on offense level 10, 6-12 months.

         Mr. Arroyo has spent almost five months in pre-trial detention.2

         Additionally, Mr. Arroyo was required to reside at Coolidge House as a condition of pre-trial

release from 7/6/05 to 2/13/06. While ordinarily pre-trial release conditions are not considered by a

sentencing court when determining the appropriate sentence, Mr. Arroyo presents the exception to

the rule. Mr. Arroyo would have enjoyed “full” pre-trial release, subject to the standard conditions, if

he had been able to secure a suitable residence. He was not. He was unable to reside with family

members in Massachusetts because each person presented with some factor which disqualified them

from being an appropriate person or place for Mr. Arroyo to reside. Mindful that Mr. Arroyo

qualified for release, but unable to permit release to a family residence in Massachusetts, the

Magistrate Judge struck a compromise by permitting release conditioned upon Mr. Arroyo residing in

Coolidge House. He abided by rules, regulations, and liberty restrictions different from ordinary pre-

trial release, even home confinement. He remained at Coolidge House for almost 7 months until he

was able to move to Schenectady, New York and reside with his wife. Mr. Arroyo submits that these

7 months of quasi incarceration/detention should be factored by the court under 18 U.S.C. §3553(a).

         If Mr. Arroyo’s offense level is 8, then this Court should sentence him to time served as a

sentence within the advisory guideline range.

         If Mr. Arroyo’s offense level is 10, then this Court should sentence him to time served as a

reasonable variance from the 6 month low end advisory guideline sentence. A sentence of time


2 6/2/05 – 7/6/05, 1 month c. 5 days;   9/27/06-1/10/07, 3 months, c. 14 days

served is warranted giving consideration for his minor role in the offense and his being the least

culpable person in the charged conspiracy. A sentence of time served is consonant with every factor

set forth in §3553(a).
