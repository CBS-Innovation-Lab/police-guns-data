                      UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                        DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

    v.                                    Criminal No. 10-cr-032-02-JD

Megann Glidden



                                 O R D E R


    On July 19, 2012, defendant was brought before the court

for her initial appearance and preliminary hearing under Fed. R.

Crim. P. 32.1 on seven alleged violations of conditions of

supervision, as charged in the government's petition dated July

17, 2012 (doc. no. 74).       Defendant is on release from her

conviction in 2011 for conspiracy to make a false statement to

licensee, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 371 and 922(a)(6);

“Straw Purchase” of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §

922(a)(6); and possession of a firearm by an unlawful user of

controlled substances, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(3).

    Defendant stipulated to probable cause on the violations.

I therefore find probable cause that defendant has violated the

conditions as charged in the petition.

    Defendant sought release on conditions under Rule

32.1(a)(6).    The government sought detention.         Under Rule

32.1(a)(6), defendant bears the burden of establishing by clear

and convincing evidence that she will not flee and that she

poses no danger to any other person or to the community.                At the

hearing, the court summarized its findings orally from the

bench.   Those oral findings are incorporated herein.           Based on

the evidence presented at the hearing, and for the reasons

stated on the record, defendant failed to meet her burden of

persuading the court that she poses no danger to any other

person or to the community.

    In sum, the court finds that defendant did not meet her

burden to show by clear and convincing evidence that her

release, even on strict conditions, would pose no danger to any

other person or the community.        Accordingly, it is ORDERED that

the defendant be detained pending a final revocation hearing.

    The defendant is committed to the custody of the Attorney

General or his designated representative for confinement in a

corrections facility separate, to the extent practicable, from

persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody

pending appeal.     The defendant shall be afforded a reasonable

opportunity for private consultation with defense counsel.               On

order of a court of the United States or on request of an

attorney for the government, the person in charge of the

corrections facility shall deliver the defendant to the United

States Marshal for the purpose of an appearance in connection

with a court proceeding.

      To the extent consistent with the jail's regulations, and

presuming that defendant qualifies for admission, the court

makes a recommendation that defendant be allowed entrance into

the Therapeutic Community Program, or the "T.C. Program," at the

Strafford County House of Corrections.

      SO ORDERED.
