for the District of Massachusetts

Re: RODRIGUEZ, Eduardo
Reg. No. 25479-038
Docket No. l:O4CR10374-01-DPW

Dear Judge Woodlock:

This is in response to the Court’s recommendation that
Eduardo Rodriguez serve his term of confinement at the federal
facility in Fort Dix, New Jersey. The Court also recommended he
participate in the Residential Drug Abuse Program (RDAP).

Mr. Rodriguez was sentenced in your court to a 70~month term for
Felon in Possession of Ammunition.

Unfortunately, we were unable to follow all of the Court’s
recommendations. Mr. Rodriguez has been classified as a medium
security level offender. The facility recommended by the Court
houses minimum and low security level offenders. Accordingly,
Mr. Rodriguez has been designated to the Beckley medium security
level facility in Beaver, West Virginia. Staff there will
encourage him to participate in the RDAP, if determined eligible
under the established program criteria.

Although we were unable to follow all of the Court’s
recommendations in this case, please be assured of our continued
commitment to satisfy judicial recommendations whenever possible.

Sincerely,

_/6,{,//“6{1/{~¢/ - ZM*>/
