                                            SENTENCING ORDER

           Steven Colby and Teenia Colby, husband and wife, committed the same crime, but

because of the dates of their sentencings, Steven Colby now faces years in prison, while Teenia

Colby has completed her one month incarceration. Sentenced without any enhancements in the

fog between Blakely1 and Booker,2 Teenia Colby received a prison term of one month, three

years supervised release, the first seven months to be served in home confinement. Awaiting

sentencing with full enhancements in the light of Booker, Steven Colby faces a Guideline range

of sentence between thirty-seven and forty-six months.              Following Judge Hornby’s lead in

United States v. Revock, 353 F. Supp. 2d 127, 129 (D. Me. 2005), this Court concludes the

disparity factor of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) requires a statutory sentence outside the Guideline range

for Mr. Colby, because he and his wife were engaged in joint criminal behavior and Ms. Colby –

sentenced between Blakely and Booker without an appeal of sentence – received the benefit of

this District’s post-Blakely approach, while Mr. Colby sentenced after Booker, would not

otherwise receive the same benefit.

    I.   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

         A. Steven and Teenia Colby

         Steven and Teenia Colby share much in common. Married with two daughters and living

in Maine, Teenia and Steven Colby were each convicted on April, 1990 in Hancock County

Superior Court for the state of Maine of Trafficking in a Schedule Z Drug, Marijuana. 3 These

convictions prevent both Mr. and Ms. Colby from possessing firearms.                        Despite the law,

Firearms Transaction Records reveal that Ms. Colby continued on a surprisingly regular basis to

purchase firearms from local retail merchants, beginning 1997. In early 2003, after neighbors

heard gun shots emanating from the Colby property, they alerted local police, because they were

aware neither Colby was supposed to have a firearm. On February 13, 2003, pursuant to a

warrant, the police searched the Colby home and found five firearms, ranging from a .22 caliber

rifle to a North China SKS 39m rifle. Ms. Colby admitted her purchases and possession; Mr.

Colby made no purchases, but admitted possession. Even though he had not fired the firearms,

he acknowledged he had instructed his wife on their use.

         B. Teenia Colby’s Case and Sentence

         By Information dated December 15, 2003, the Government charged Ms. Colby with

being a felon in possession of firearms, a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). Ms. Colby pleaded

guilty on January 4, 2004 and she was sentenced on September 15, 2004 after the United States

Supreme Court’s ruling in Blakely. The Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) found Ms.

Colby’s total offense level was twenty; it imposed a three level increase since the instant offense

involved between eight and twelve firearms;4 and, after granting a three-level reduction for


3
  Teenia Colby was convicted on April 2, 1990 of Trafficking in a Schedule Z Drug, a Class C felony; Steven Colby
was convicted on April 6, 1990 of Aggravated Trafficking in a Schedule Z Drug, a Class B felony. His
classification was enhanced because he carried a firearm during the commission of the crime.
4
  The PSR counted the firearms she purchased from 1997 onward plus the firearms in the Colby residence.

acceptance of responsibility; it calculated a total offense level of twenty. With a criminal history

category of I, the Guideline range of sentence was between thirty-three and forty-one months

imprisonment. 5      After Blakely, but before Booker, this District required facts supporting

Guideline enhancements either admitted by the defendant or proven to a jury beyond a

reasonable doubt. Stripped of enhancements, Ms. Colby received a sentence substantially lower

than the applicable Guideline range, spending only one month in prison and seven months in

home detention.

        C. Steven Colby’s Case and Guideline Sentence

        By Indictment dated March 9, 2004, the Government charged Steven Colby with being a

felon in possession of a firearm, a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). Mr. Colby pleaded guilty

to the charged offense on October 20, 2004.6 Mr. Colby’s PSR was completed on January 12,

2005 and revised on February 18, 2005. The Report essentially tracked Ms. Colby’s, arriving at

a total offense level of twenty. With a criminal history category II, Mr. Colby’s Guideline range

for incarceration falls between thirty-seven to forty-six months.7

        D. Teenia and Steven Colby: A Comparison

        Despite their striking similarities, there are differences between Teenia and Steven Colby.

First, because Ms. Colby’s criminal history category was Category I and Mr. Colby’s is Category

II, Mr. Colby faces a slightly higher sentencing range. This is because when they trafficked in

marijuana in 1990, Mr. Colby packed a firearm and Ms. Colby did not. He, therefore, received a

firearms enhancement and a prison term and she did not. His prior possession of a firearm

5
  The Guideline also includes a period of supervised release between two and three years, a fine between $7,500.00
and $75,000.00, and a special assessment of $100.00.
6
  It is true that Ms. Colby pleaded guilty within one month of being charged and Mr. Colby waited seven months
before pleading guilty. If he had pleaded guilty as quickly as his wife, he would likely have been sentenced under
the District policies during the interregnum. However, the delay was caused primarily by his counsel’s exploration
of a motion to suppress and by his medical condition and this Court does not hold the delay against him.
7
  He faces the same periods of supervised release, the same fine range, and the same special assessment as Ms.
Colby.


                                                        3
Case 1:04-cr-00023-JAW Document 60 Filed 05/03/05 Page 4 of 6                     PageID #: 112



during the commission of a drug trafficking offense could justify a higher sentence this time as

well, especially because the current offense is a firearms offense.

       Mr. Colby’s complicity in this crime, however, is markedly less than his wife’s. Ms.

Colby made each of the firearms purchases from 1997 onward; Mr. Colby purchased no

firearms. Further, Mr. and Mrs. Colby had been separated since 2000 and therefore, at the time

of many of Ms. Colby’s firearms purchases and at the time of the search, Mr. Colby was not

actually living in the Colby home in Franklin. He was instead living in Bar Harbor, Maine with

his father. Ms. Colby was living with one of their daughters in the residence where the firearms

were found. The regularity of his visits to the Colby home in Franklin and his instructing his wife

on the use of the firearms were sufficient to constitute constructive possession, but his actual

possession was neither alleged nor established.

       In all other respects relevant to sentencing, they are virtually indistinguishable. They

grew up in the same area of Maine and, in fact, have known each other since age fourteen. They

have been married since 1982. Ms. Colby is better educated, completing two years of college;

whereas, Mr. Colby dropped out of school in the ninth grade, and Ms. Colby has worked more

recently.   Although Mr. Colby contends with a more impressive array of medical and

psychological problems, they have each received social security disability benefits. They present

a similar history of substance abuse and have similar, though not identical, criminal records and

they responded in similar ways to the pending charges.

 II.   DISCUSSION

            A. The Guideline Sentence

       Booker instructs sentencing courts to “consult [the] Guidelines and take them into

account when sentencing.” Booker, 125 S. Ct. at 767. Consulting the Guidelines and applying




                                                  4
Case 1:04-cr-00023-JAW Document 60 Filed 05/03/05 Page 5 of 6                                 PageID #: 113



them to Mr. Colby’s case, the inescapable result is that Mr. Colby would be sentenced under the

Guidelines to a significantly harsher sentence than Ms. Colby received.8 The Defendant has not

filed a motion for downward departure and this Court is unaware of any Guideline provision that

would justify a sentence outside the Guideline range of thirty seven to forty six months. See

United States v. Thurston, 358 F.3d 51, 78 (1st Cir. 2004)(“…basing the departure on grounds of

disparity in sentence alone between Thurston and Isola was beyond the district court’s

authority.”), vacated and remanded on other grounds, __ U.S.__, 125 S. Ct. 984 (2005); United

States v. Wogan, 938 F.2d 1446, 1449 (1st Cir. 1991).

        B. The Statutory Sentence

        Once the sentencing court has taken the Guidelines into account, it is required to assess

whether the Guideline sentence meets the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).

Booker, 125 S. Ct. at 764. The Act “requires judges to consider the Guidelines ‘sentencing range

established for … the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable category of

defendant,’ § 3553(a)(4), the pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statements, the need to

avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims (citations

omitted).’” Id. at 764-65 (emphases supplied). Unlike the Guidelines, the statute expressly

provides that the sentencing court “shall consider… the need to avoid unwarranted sentence

disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar

conduct.” 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6). Under Booker, the sentencing court is not merely free to

consider, it must consider a factor impermissible under the Guidelines: whether the Guideline

sentence would perpetrate “unwarranted sentencing disparities.” 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6).


8
 In Ms. Colby’s case, the Government agreed to support a reduction under U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b); it made no similar
agreement with Mr. Colby. In sentencing Ms. Colby, the Court did not concur with the application of the sporting
use exception and there is no evidence that the exception not applicable to Ms. Colby, would be applicable to Mr.
Colby.


                                                       5
Case 1:04-cr-00023-JAW Document 60 Filed 05/03/05 Page 6 of 6                      PageID #: 114



       In making this assessment, this Court is unable to distinguish the facts in Colby from the

facts in Revock and it concurs fully with Judge Hornby’s thoughtful analysis in Revock. Judge

Hornby specifically limited application of the disparity factor of section 3553(a) to

       . . . a very narrow category of cases. It applies to defendants with similar records
       who engaged in joint criminal behavior where one participant—sentenced
       between Blakely and Booker without an appeal of the sentence—received the
       benefit of this District’s post-Blakely approach, while the other participant was
       sentenced after Booker, without receiving the same benefit.

Id. The narrow Revock holding applies with equal force here.

III.   CONCLUSION

       Applying the sentencing factor set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6), this Court imposes a

statutory sentence outside the Guideline range on Defendant Steven Colby:               one month

incarceration followed by three years supervised release, the first seven months to be served in

home confinement, and a $100.00 special assessment.

       SO ORDERED.
