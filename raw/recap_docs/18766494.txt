Robert E. Rogers, II




                                  ORDER



       Defendant's assented-to motion to continue the trial (document no. 8) is granted.

3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would unreasonably deny the

defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective preparation taking into account the
