                  ORDER AFFIRMING THE
       RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE


        The United States Magistrate Judge filed with the Court on September

  9, 2013 her Recommended Decision (ECF No. 36). The Defendant filed his

  objections to the Recommended Decision on September 26, 2013 (ECF No. 39)

  and the Government filed its response to those objections on September 27,

  2013 (ECF No. 40). I have reviewed and considered the Magistrate Judge's

  Recommended Decision, together with the entire record; I have made a de

  novo determination of all matters adjudicated by the Magistrate Judge's

  Recommended Decision; and I concur with the recommendations of the

  United States Magistrate Judge for the reasons set forth in her

  Recommended Decision, and determine that no further proceeding is

  necessary.

        1.     It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the
               Magistrate Judge is hereby AFFIRMED.

        2.     It is further ORDERED that the Defendantâ€™s Motion to Suppress
               (ECF No. 24) be and hereby is DENIED.
