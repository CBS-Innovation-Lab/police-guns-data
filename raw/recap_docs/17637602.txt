STATEMENT OF REASONS

Vll COURT DETERM]NAT[ONS OF REST|TUT|ON
A 1 Restitution Not Applicable.
B Total Amount ol` Restitution:
C Restitution not ordered (('heck onlyone.):

l |:| For oti`enses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under |8 U S C § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U S.C §3663A(c)(3)(A).

2 I:l l~`or offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U S C § 3663.1\, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
issues ofl`act and relating them to the cause or amount ofthe victims` losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(B).
3 |:I For other olt`cnses for which restitution is authorized under l8 U S L` § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
ordered because the complication and prolongation ol`the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning ofa restitution order outweigh

the need to provide restitution to any victims under 13 l.l S C § 3663(3)(|)(3)(\1).
