                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 07-cr-187-PB

Jeffrey Lance Brown



                                  O R D E R

     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

February 5, 2008 trial in the above case, citing the need for

additional time to engage in plea negotiations or otherwise

prepare for trial.       The government does not object to a

continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reasons and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from February 5, 2008 to May 6, 2008.                 In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
