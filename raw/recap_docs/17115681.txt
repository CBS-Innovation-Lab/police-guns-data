                         ORDER AFFIRMING THE
              RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE


     The United States Magistrate Judge filed with the Court on August 15, 2006 her

  Recommended Decision.       The Defendant filed his objections to the Recommended

  Decision on August 31, 2006 and the Government filed its response to those objections

  on September 1, 2006.       I have reviewed and considered the Magistrate Judge's

  Recommended Decision, together with the entire record; I have made a de novo

  determination of all matters adjudicated by the Magistrate Judge's Recommended

  Decision; and I concur with the recommendations of the United States Magistrate Judge

  for the reasons set forth in her Recommended Decision, and determine that no further

  proceeding is necessary.

         1.       It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the
                  Magistrate Judge is hereby AFFIRMED.

         2.       It is further ORDERED that the Defendantâ€™s Motion to Dismiss
                  Indictment (Docket No. 38) is DENIED.


                                              /s/John A. Woodcock, Jr.
                                              JOHN A. WOODCOCK, JR.
                                              UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE
