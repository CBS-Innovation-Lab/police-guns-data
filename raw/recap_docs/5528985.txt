                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                        DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS

UNITED STATES of AMERICA,
                                                     Case No.: 1:04-cr-10299-PBS-30
v.

GENE ANDERSON, et al,
         Defendants.
                MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
                   (OF SELF-SURRENDER DATE)

Defendant, Gene Anderson, requests an order permitting an extension of his

post-conviction release and self- reporting date by seven days. Counsel has

spoken to Cindy Mayo of US BOP’s Sentence Computation and Designations

Center in Grand Prairie, Texas and she reports that Mr. Anderson should be

designated by Monday. Given the savings to the government in allowing an

inmate to self-report and the beneficial effect on Mr. Anderson’s security

classification. Accordingly, an extension of seven days for Mr. Anderson to

report would serve the interests of justice.

       AUSA Gallagher was not available for comment at this time.

       Dated this 16th day of February, 2007 at Boston, Massachusetts

                                          Respectfully submitted,
