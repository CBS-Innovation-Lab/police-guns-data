                   UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                     DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

    v.                                 Criminal No. 06-cr-079-01-PB

Dorothy Collins


                               O R D E R


    On August 22, 2011, defendant appeared for a preliminary

hearing under Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.1 on three alleged violations

of conditions of supervision, as charged in the government's

petition dated August 18, 2011 (doc. no. 139).        Defendant is on

release from her conviction in 2007 for Interference with

Commerce by Threats or Violence, Possession of a Firearm with an

Obliterated Serial Number, and Possession of a Firearm by a

Convicted Felon.

    The government alleges that, while on supervised release,

defendant violated the conditions of her release by committing

the crimes of illegal possession and use of a controlled

substance (Standard Conditions #1 and #3) and failing to enroll

in a program for narcotic addiction or drug or alcohol

dependency (Standard Condition #2).        The defendant waived the

preliminary hearing, thereby conceding that the governmentâ€™s

                                   1

evidence was sufficient to establish probable cause that she had

violated the conditions as charged in the petition.

    Defendant sought release under Rule 32.1(a)(6). The

government sought detention.     Under Rule 32.1(a)(6), defendant

bears the burden of establishing by clear and convincing

evidence that she will not flee and that she poses no danger to

any other person or to the community.       The court issued its

ruling orally from the bench.     The court incorporates its oral

ruling herein, and for the reasons stated on the record, finds

that defendant did not meet her burden to show by clear and

convincing evidence that her release, even on strict conditions,

would pose no danger to any other person or the community.

Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the defendant be detained

pending a final revocation hearing.

    The defendant is committed to the custody of the Attorney

General or his designated representative for confinement in a

corrections facility separate, to the extent practicable, from

persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody

pending appeal.   The defendant shall be afforded a reasonable

opportunity for private consultation with defense counsel.            On

order of a court of the United States or on request of an

attorney for the government, the person in charge of the

                                   2

corrections facility shall deliver the defendant to the United

States Marshal for the purpose of an appearance in connection

with a court proceeding.

      SO ORDERED.
