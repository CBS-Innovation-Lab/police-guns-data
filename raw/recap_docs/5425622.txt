                                  )

                  ASSENTED TO MOTION FOR A CONTINUANCE

        The United States of America, by and through the undersigned

attorneys, hereby moves for a continuance of the sentencing date

in this matter for a period of 180 days from the currently

scheduled date of February 11, 2008.

        In support of its motion, the government states that the

defendant's plea agreement requires the defendant to cooperate

with the United States.     It is anticipated that the defendant

will testify in the case United States v. Arthur Gianelli, et

al., Crim. No 05-10003-NMG, a thirteen defendant racketeering

case.    Currently, the defendants in the Gianelli case are

scheduled to file pre-trial motions on February 29, 2008, and the

governmentâ€™s response is due on April 10, 2008.            Once pre-trial

motions have been resolved by the district court, the Gianelli

case will be ready for trial.      However, it is unlikely that it

will be finally resolved within the next six months.

     The defendant, therefore, assents to a continuance of his

sentencing for the reasons set forth above.
