   DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR REDUCTION OF SENTENCE PURSUANT TO
          18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) AND U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10

     The United States, by United States Attorney Michael J.

Sullivan and Assistant United States Attorney James Lang, and the

defendant Crandall Rack, by defense counsel Timothy G. Watkins,

Assistant Federal Public Defender, respectfully submit this

memorandum to address the defendant’s eligibility for a reduction

in his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) and U.S.S.G.

§ 1B1.10.   Defendant further moves under those provisions that

the Court resentence the defendant to time-served.

                       I.   JOINT STATUS REPORT

     Pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Court’s procedural order

dated March 13, 2008, the parties have conferred with each other

and with United States Probation Officer Martha Victoria, and

report as follows:
   Case 1:04-cr-10300-GAO    Document 66   Filed 04/18/2008   Page 2 of 9



     1.(a)         The parties have differing positions on
                   defendant’s eligibility for a reduction in
                   sentence in accordance with 18 U.S.C.
                   § 3582(c)(2), with the Probation Department
                   opposing and the Government taking no position
                   pending clarification by the Court.

             (i)   General background of this case.

     On September 29, 2005, the defendant was charged in a two-

count indictment charging possession with intent to distribute

cocaine base and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug

trafficking offense.     PSR at Part A, ¶ 2 & 3.      The government

also alleged that the weight of the cocaine base exceeded five

grams, and thus invoked the statutory mandatory minimum provided

in 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B)(iii).        After a bench trial, the Court

found the defendant guilty of possession with intent to

distribute cocaine base, but concluded that the government had

not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the quantity of cocaine

base exceeded five grams.

     At sentencing, the Court applied the sentencing guidelines

and held defendant accountable for between five and twenty grams

of cocaine base, and further determined that defendant had

possessed a dangerous weapon during the offense.          This yielded a

Total Offense Level of 28.      PSR at ¶ 25.

     Defendant had three criminal history points as the result of

a continued without a finding disposition; thus his Criminal

History Category was II and his Guideline Sentencing Range was

87-108 months.     PSR at ¶ 65.   The Court imposed a non-guideline

                                   -2-
   Case 1:04-cr-10300-GAO   Document 66   Filed 04/18/2008   Page 3 of 9



sentence of 60 months’ imprisonment, a sentence 31% lower than

the bottom of the Guideline Sentencing Range, citing the nature

and circumstances of the offense and that the defendant’s prior

disposition did not result in a lengthy sentence and was not

especially serious in the context of the defendant’s life.

          (ii) Pertinent legal authority.

     During the past amendment cycle, the United States

Sentencing Commission amended the crack cocaine guidelines to

lower penalties in crack cocaine offenses.1       The amendments

(Amendment 706 as amended by 711) were the result of years of

critical study and analysis by the Commission.         See Kimbrough v.

United States, 128 S.Ct. 558, 568-69 (2007).        Effective March 3,

2008, the Commission voted unanimously to apply the crack cocaine

amendments retroactively to sentences that had otherwise become

final.

     Title 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) provides:

     [I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a
     term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has
     subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission
     pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant
     or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own
     motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after
     considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the
     extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is
     consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the
     Sentencing Commission.

     The governing Sentencing Commission policy statement is


     1
      Generally, the amendments reduce the offense level in crack
cocaine cases by two levels.

U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10.    Section 1B1.10(a)(1) provides, in pertinent

part:

     (1)     In General.—In a case in which a defendant is serving a
             term of imprisonment, and the guideline range
             applicable to that defendant has subsequently been
             lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines
             Manual listed in subsection (c) below, the court may
             reduce the defendant’s term of imprisonment as provided
             by 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). . . .

(emphasis added).    Furthermore, where, as here, the court

downwardly departed from the applicable guideline sentencing

range at the original sentencing, § 1B1.10(b)(2)(B) provides that

a comparable departure from the new guideline range may be

appropriate:

     If the original term of imprisonment imposed was less than
     the term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range
     applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing, a
     reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range
     determined under subdivision (1) of this subsection may be
     appropriate. . . .

U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10(b)(2)(B).     Finally, the Commission’s crack

cocaine amendments are enumerated in § 1B1.10(c) as amendments

which may be applied retroactively.

     As discussed further below, application of the new crack

cocaine amendments lowers the guideline range applicable to the

defendant.    The defendant is therefore eligible for a reduction

under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) and U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10.

     1.(b)        Revised guideline calculation.

     Defendant remains in Criminal History Category II.           In

defendant’s view, his new     Guideline Sentencing Range is 70-87

                                  -4-
   Case 1:04-cr-10300-GAO   Document 66   Filed 04/18/2008   Page 5 of 9



months (compared to his old Guideline Sentencing Range of 87-108

months).

     1.(c)     Recommendation for sentencing.

     Defendant’s current release date is December 6, 2008.            A

report prepared by the United States Probation Office indicates

that, while incarcerated, the defendant (1) earned his GED while

in custody, (2) participated in several other education programs,

and (3) incurred just two minor disciplinary reports.           The

Probation Department’s report is attached as Exhibit A.

Defendant is now serving the final portion of his sentence at the

Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York.          According

to the Presentence Report, Mr. Rack will return to his mother’s

home in Roxbury (where she lives with a Boston Police Officer)

and will have job opportunities available to him upon his

release.

     Each of the parties - defendant, the government, and the

Probation Office - has differing view in its recommendation for

action by the Court.    The parties agree that if the Court

departed from the low-end of the Guideline Sentencing by the same

magnitude (31%) it did when it imposed the original sentence, it

would impose a sentence of 47 months - 13 months lower than the

60 months actually imposed by the court.       Because defendant has

actually completed 51 months of the previously imposed 60-month

sentence (adjusted for earned good time), he has served four


                                  -5-
   Case 1:04-cr-10300-GAO    Document 66   Filed 04/18/2008   Page 6 of 9



months longer than a proportionally-adjusted sentence and thus

appears facially eligible for a reduction to time-served and

immediate release.

     Notwithstanding his facial eligibility, however, the

Probation Department contends that the defendant is ineligible

for further reduction.      This is so, according to the Probation

Department, because the Court’s preponderance finding during the

sentencing hearing that the offense involved in excess of five

grams of cocaine base for guidelines purposes also implicitly

triggered the statutory mandatory minimum sentence making further

reduction legally impossible.      In defendant’s view, the Probation

Department’s position appears to be at odds with the Court’s

explicit determination during trial that the government had not

proved the element of weight beyond a reasonable doubt and its

further conclusion at sentencing that the mandatory minimum was

not implicated.   Sent Hrg. Tr. at 11.      That determination is

echoed in the Judgment, which states that “no count of conviction

carries a mandatory minimum sentence.”

     The government takes a middle position.         It would defer

to the Court’s clarification of the determination it made at

trial on the evidence presented as to whether the government

proved by a preponderance that the defendant possessed with

intent to distribute more than five grams of cocaine base.             If

the Court’s finding at trial was that the evidence did not


                                   -6-
   Case 1:04-cr-10300-GAO   Document 66   Filed 04/18/2008   Page 7 of 9



support even a preponderance finding (in addition to failing to

meet the beyond a reasonable doubt standard), the Court is free

to give the proportional reduction and sentence defendant to time

served.    Conversely, if the Court determines that although the

government did not reach the beyond a reasonable doubt standard

at trial it had proved the weight by a preponderance standard,

the 60-month mandatory minimum applies and no reduction can be

granted.

     1.(d)       Necessity for hearing; the defendant’s presence.

     The parties respectfully submit that a hearing in this

matter is not necessary.    The parties are available, however,

should the Court wish to conduct a hearing and, in light of the

fact that the defendant may be eligible for immediate release,

respectfully request that such a hearing be expedited.           If the

Court deems a hearing necessary, defense counsel may request that

the defendant be permitted to appear via video conference.

     1.(e)       The earliest projected release date based on the
                 low end of the revised guideline calculation.

     In defendant’s view, he is eligible for release immediately

based on a reduction from the low end of the revised guideline

calculation proportional to that the Court employed at

defendant’s original sentencing hearing.       As outlined above

however, the Probation Department’s view is that a reduction is

not possible and defendant’s release date must remain December 6,

2008.

     1.(f)      Briefing schedule.

     The parties respectfully submit that a briefing schedule is

not necessary in this case.

     1.(g)      Necessity of transcript.

     The transcript of the sentencing hearing is attached hereto

as Exhibit B.

     1.(h)      Plea Agreement.

     There was no plea agreement in connection with the

disposition of this case.

    DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR REDUCTION OF SENTENCE PURSUANT TO
          18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) AND U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10

     Based upon the foregoing, defendant hereby moves the Court

to resentence the defendant pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2)

and U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10 and to impose a sentence of time-served.

As outlined above, the government takes no position until

clarification by the Court of its finding during trial.

     RESPECTFULLY submitted this 18th day of April, 2008.
