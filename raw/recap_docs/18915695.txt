                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                       DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America,
      Plaintiff

             v.                              Case No. 08-cr-25-01-SM

Kenneth Perron,
     Defendant

                                    ORDER


      Defendant Perron’s motion to continue the trial is granted (document no.

17). Trial has been rescheduled for the month of October 2009. Defendant

Perron shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights not later than September 17,

2009. On the filing of such waiver, his continuance shall be effective.

      The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial,

18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would

unreasonably deny the defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances.
