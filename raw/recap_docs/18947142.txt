                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 10-cr-67-PB

James Matthew Grey

                                  O R D E R



     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

trial scheduled for July 7, 2010, citing a scheduling conflict

and the need for additional time to review extensive discovery

and prepare a defense.       The government does not object to a

continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reasons, the court will continue

the trial from July 7, 2010 to October 5, 2010.            In agreeing to

continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ยง

3161(h)(7)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the ends of

justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the best

interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
