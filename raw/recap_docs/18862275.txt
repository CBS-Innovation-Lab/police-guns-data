                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 07-cr-248-PB

Stephanie Nagy


                                  O R D E R

     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

May 6, 2008 trial in the above case to allow additional time to

negotiate a plea agreement.        The government does not object to a

continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reason and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from May 6, 2008 to August 19, 2008.              In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial

     The April 22, 2008 final pretrial conference is continued to

July 30, 2008 at 3:45 p.m.
