              ORDER AFFIRMING RECOMMENDED DECISION
                     OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE


      On November 13, 2015, the United States Magistrate Judge filed with the
court, with copies to the parties, his Recommended Decision on Motion for
Release. The time within which to file objections expired on December 21, 2015,
and no objection has been filed. The Magistrate Judge notified the parties that
failure to object would waive their right to de novo review and appeal.
      It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the Magistrate
Judge is hereby ADOPTED. The petitioner’s motion for release is DENIED    WITHOUT

PREJUDICE   to petitioner’s ability to reassert his request for release should
petitioner conclude that he can establish a high probability of success on his
claim or other facts that would constitute exceptional circumstances.

      SO ORDERED.

      DATED THIS 5TH DAY OF JANUARY, 2016
