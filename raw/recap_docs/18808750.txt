                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE




United States of America

     v.                                       Criminal No.   06-103-01-B

Sherry Broderick


                                  O R D E R


     The defendant has moved to continue the March 6, 2007 trial

in the above case.       Defendant cites the need for additional time

to negotiate a plea.       The government does not object to a

continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, in order to allow the parties additional time

for plea negotiations and properly prepare for trial, the court

will continue the trial from March 6, 2007 to April 3, 2007.               In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
