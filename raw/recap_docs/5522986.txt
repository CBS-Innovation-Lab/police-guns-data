                     GOVERNMENT’S STATUS REPORT

     The government respectfully submits the following as its

status report:

     On January 16, 2007, the Court issued an oral ruling

suppressing the firearm and ammunition in this case.          At the time

the Court entered its order on the docket, it stated that it

would issue a memorandum within the next two weeks more fully

explaining its determination.     As of this date, the issuance of

the Court’s memorandum is still pending.       The government

anticipates filing a notice of appeal [which in the normal

course, would be due within 30 days from the Court’s granting of

the suppression motion] or a motion for reconsideration.           The

government, however, cannot assess whether it should file a

motion to reconsider until it receives the Court’s written order.

     The government has, therefore, filed this day, a motion for

an order establishing that the 30-day period for the government

to file a notice of appeal from the court’s 1/16/06 oral

suppression order or for the filing of a timely motion for

reconsideration will not begin until the Court issues its written

opinion or rules on the government’s motion for reconsideration.

Said motion is still pending.

     Discovery has been completed.        The Court has scheduled a

Status Conference for February 1, 2007.



                                       Respectfully submitted,
