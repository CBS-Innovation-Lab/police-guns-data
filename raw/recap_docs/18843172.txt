                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                         DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                   Criminal No. 05-cr-138-01-PB

Jamison Mims


                                  O R D E R

     On November 2, 2007, defendant appeared for a “probable

cause” hearing under Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.1 on one alleged

violation of conditions of supervision.           Defendant waived his

right to a hearing for probable cause on the violations.                 I

therefore find probable cause to hold him for a revocation

hearing.

     Defendant sought bail conditions under Rule 32.1(a)(6).

Under Rule 32.1(a)(6) defendant bears the burden of establishing

by clear and convincing evidence that he will not flee and that

he poses no danger to any other person or to the community.

Defendant was given multiple opportunities to deal with his

alcoholism (December 11, 2006; July 13, 2007; August 29, 2007;

September 21, 2007).       On October 20, 2007, he was arrested for

second offense DUI, blew .27, drove all over the road and in the

wrong direction.      He is a danger to the community.         There are no

conditions which are likely to assure his presence and the safety

of the community.

      Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the defendant be detained

pending his revocation hearing.

      The defendant is committed to the custody of the Attorney

General or his designated representative for confinement in a

corrections facility separate, to the extent practicable, from

persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody

pending appeal.     The defendant shall be afforded a reasonable

opportunity for private consultation with defense counsel.             On

order of a court of the United States or on request of an

attorney for the government, the person in charge of the

corrections facility shall deliver the defendant to the United

States Marshal for the purpose of an appearance in connection

with a court proceeding.

      SO ORDERED.
