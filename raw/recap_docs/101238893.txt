      RECOMMENDED DECISION ON RULE 52(b) AND 60(a) MOTIONS

      In this action, Petitioner Xavier Watson seeks relief from the Court’s orders denying

his motion for relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. (Motions, ECF No. 306, 306-1.) Petitioner,

citing Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 52(b) and 60(a), questions whether the Court

properly considered and ruled on certain claims he raised in a series of filings

supplementing his § 2255 motion.

      Following a review of Petitioner’s filings and the record, I recommend the Court

deny Petitioner’s motions. (ECF No. 306, 306-1).

                            PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND DISCUSSION

      In May 2017, following a guilty plea, Petitioner was convicted of Hobbs Act

robbery, 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a) (Count 2); and aiding and abetting the brandishing of a

firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (Count 3); the Court

sentenced Petitioner to prison terms totaling 121 months. (Judgment, ECF No. 177 at 1-

2.) In February 2018, the Court amended the sentence, resulting in prison terms totaling
115 months. (Id.; Amended Judgment, ECF No. 264 at 1-2.) Petitioner did not appeal from

the conviction or the sentence.

       On May 14, 2018, Petitioner filed a motion to vacate, set aside or correct the

sentence, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255. (Motion, ECF No. 276.) On October 1, 2018, in

response to the Government’s answer to the motion, Petitioner filed a motion to buttress

his original arguments.    (Motion, ECF No. 279.)       On October 24, 2018, I granted

Petitioner’s motion to buttress and recommended the Court deny Petitioner’s request for

relief on his § 2255 motion.       (Recommended Decision, ECF No. 283; Amended

Recommended Decision, ECF No. 285.)1 In December 2018, Petitioner filed additional

motions to buttress and supplement his § 2255 claims, along with several other motions.

(Motions, ECF Nos. 291 – 96, 298 – 99). The Court granted one of the motions to buttress

on December 28, 2018, and on January 4, 2019, the Court accepted the recommended

decision and denied Petitioner’s § 2255 motion. (Order, ECF No. 303.)

       On February 5, 2019, I issued two additional recommended decisions addressing

Petitioner’s other motions, including the motions to buttress and supplement his § 2255

claims. (Orders, ECF Nos. 307 – 08). The Court accepted the recommended decisions on

March 19, 2018, denying Petitioner’s additional motions. (Orders, ECF Nos. 309 – 10.)

       Meanwhile, on February 1, 2019, shortly before the two additional recommended

decisions were docketed, Petitioner filed the motions presently before the Court. (Motions,

ECF No. 306, 306-1.) Petitioner seeks relief from the denial of his § 2255 motion based

  On October 30, 2019, I amended the recommended decision; the amendment did not alter the
recommendation.

oin his other motions to buttress or supplement, which were pending when the Court ruled

on the § 2255 motion. Petitioner asserts the motions would have been filed earlier but for

his inadvertence or mistake. (Motion, ECF No. 306.) Petitioner, citing Abbott v. Perez,

138 S. Ct. 2305, 2319, (2018), contends the Court’s denial of his § 2255 motion had the

practical effect of denying the constitutional claims in his other pending motions to buttress

and supplement.

        In February 2019, the Court, through the adoption of the recommended decisions,

addressed the arguments Petitioner made in his many filings.                     As explained in the

recommended decisions, even if Petitioner had presented all of his arguments timely,

Petitioner’s arguments would have failed because the arguments lack merit. The Court has

addressed Petitioner’s arguments in detail, and additional or amended findings under Rule

52(b) are not warranted, nor is Petitioner entitled to relief from the Court’s earlier orders

under Rule 60(a).2

                                             CONCLUSION

        Based on the foregoing analysis, I recommend the Court deny Petitioner’s motions.

  Conceivably, Petitioner’s motions can be construed to reference motions that have not yet been filed as a
result of inadvertence or mistake. In that event, Petitioner would not be entitled to relief because he had
sufficient opportunity to present the arguments and correct any mistake and he has not done so.
