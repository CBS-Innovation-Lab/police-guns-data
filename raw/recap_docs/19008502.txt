Carl Conkle



                                  O R D E R


     The defendant has moved to continue the August 21, 2012

trial in the above case for a period of 90 days, citing the need

for additional time to complete discovery and prepare for trial

other disposition.       The government does not object to a

continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reason and in order to allow the

parties additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court

will continue the trial from August 21, 2012 to November 6,

2012.     In agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds

pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ' 3161(h)(7)(A) that for the above-stated

reasons, the ends of justice served in granting a continuance

outweigh the best interests of the public and the defendant in a

speedy trial.
