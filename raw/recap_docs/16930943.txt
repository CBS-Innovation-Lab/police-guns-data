                             ORDER AFFIRMING THE
                 RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE


        The     United    States      Magistrate         Judge   filed   with   the

  Court    on    July    25,   2005    her       Recommended     Decision.      The

  Defendant filed his objections to the Recommended Decision

  on July 29, 2005 and the Government filed its response to

  those objections on August 11, 2005. I have reviewed and

  considered      the     Magistrate      Judge's        Recommended     Decision,

  together with the entire record; I have made a de novo

  determination of all matters adjudicated by the Magistrate

  Judge's       Recommended     Decision;          and    I   concur     with   the

  recommendations of the United States Magistrate Judge for

  the   reasons     set    forth     in   her     Recommended     Decision,     and

  determine that no further proceeding is necessary.


          1.    It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended
                Decision of the Magistrate Judge is hereby
                AFFIRMED.

       2.    It is further ORDERED that the Defendantâ€™s
             Motion to Suppress (Docket #17) is DENIED.
