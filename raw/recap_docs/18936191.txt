                    UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                       DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

            v.                                Case No. 08-cr-129-01-SM

Anthony Rabbia



                                     ORDER



      Defendant's assented-to motion to continue the trial (document no. 45) is

granted. Trial has been rescheduled for the May 2010 trial period. Defendant has file

a waiver of speedy trial.

      The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C.

ยง 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would unreasonably deny

the defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective preparation taking into

account the exercise of due diligence under the circumstances.
