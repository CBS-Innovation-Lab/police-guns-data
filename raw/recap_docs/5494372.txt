STATEMENT OF REASONS

Vll COURT DETERMINATIONS OF RESTITUTION
A m Restitution Not Applicable.

B Total Arnount of Restitution:

 

C Restitution not ordered (Check only one.);

] l:l For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

2 j:l For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex

issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount ofthe vietims' losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 13 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(B).

3 l:l For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U,S.C. § 3663 and!or required by tim sentencing guidelincs, restitution is not

ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh
the need to provide restitution to any victims under 13 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(l)(13)(ii).

4 i:l Restitution is not ordered for other reasons. (Explain.)

D l:l Partial restitution is ordered for these reasons (18 U.S.C. § 3553(¢)):
