                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                        DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

             v.                           Criminal No. 10-cr-37-02-JL

Rebecca Paulhus


                                  O R D E R


        The assented to motion to reschedule jury trial (document no.

16 ) filed by defendant is granted; Final Pretrial is rescheduled

to July 22, 2010 at 3:00pm; Trial is continued to the two-week

period beginning August 3, 2010, 09:30am.

        Defendant shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights within 10

days.    The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting

a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv), for the

reasons set forth in the motion.

        SO ORDERED.
