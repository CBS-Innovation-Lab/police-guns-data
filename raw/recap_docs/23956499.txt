              ORDER ON REQUEST FOR EARLY TERMINATION
                      OF SUPERVISED RELEASE


      This petitioner has requested early termination of his supervised release
just over 2 years into the 5-year period. The government has responded. I agree
with the government that the petitioner has made good progress. I also agree
that termination now may be premature given the short duration of supervised
release to date and the nature of the original crimes. Probation (both the District
of Maine and the District of Vermont) does not oppose the petitionerâ€™s travel to
New York to start his own business venture, and he should seek such permission
from his supervising officer. In the meantime, I DEFER ruling on the petition
while waiting to see whether the proposed business plans materialize. Counsel
shall report by March 30, 2018, on the status of the petitioner and his plans.

      SO ORDERED.

      DATED THIS 27TH DAY OF NOVEMBER, 2017
