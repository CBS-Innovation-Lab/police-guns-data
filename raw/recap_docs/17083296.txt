                 ORDER ON GOVERNMENT’S MOTION FOR
                        AMENDED JUDGMENT


      The government has moved to amend the judgment for this defendant. The

judgment was entered on November 29, 2005, following a sentencing on

November 28, 2005. The government requests that the judgment be amended “to

reflect that the charging instrument in this case was an Information vice

Indictment.” Mot. for Amended Judgment at 1 (Docket Item 28). It also requests

that the judgment be amended to reflect that the 85-month sentence imposed was

5 months on Count I and 80 months on Count II, to be served consecutively. Id.

The requested change concerning the sentencing language was provoked by a

Bureau of Prisons inquiry to both the Court and the government, the Bureau

being uncertain how to implement the court’s sentence of “85 months on Counts I

and II.” The defendant opposes the motion.

      The motion implicates Rules 35(a) and 36 of the Federal Rules of Criminal

Procedure. Rule 35(a) provides:
Case 2:05-cr-00042-DBH Document 31 Filed 08/18/06 Page 2 of 4              PageID #: 65



             Within 7 days after sentencing, the court may correct a
             sentence that resulted from arithmetical, technical, or other
             clear error.

Rule 36 provides:

             After giving any notice it considers appropriate, the court may
             at any time correct a clerical error in a judgment, order, or
             other part of the record, or correct an error in the record
             arising from oversight or omission.

The defendant argues that because this motion affects the sentence and comes

well after the 7 days, the court lacks jurisdiction to grant the motion.

      First, there is clearly authority under Rule 36 to correct the clerical error

concerning the nature of the charging document. Accordingly, the motion is

GRANTED to amend the judgment to show that the case started by an Information.

      Second, I conclude that Rule 36 should provide authority for the second

relief requested. This is not a case involving correction of “a sentence that resulted

from arithmetical, technical, or other clear error.” Rule 35(a) (emphasis added).

The sentence imposed was “85 months on Counts I and II,” no change is proposed

in that sentence, and it did not result from arithmetical or technical error.

Instead, the error here (if there was error) was oversight or omission in failing to

specify how the 85 months relate to each of the two counts. The government does

not propose that the sentence itself—85 months—be altered; instead, the proposal

is that the judgment be corrected to supply the missing allocation in the sentence

that was actually imposed.       But I do not believe the government’s proposed

allocation (5 months to Counts I, 80 months to Count II) is appropriate. That

would mean that if the defendant found a way to vacate Count II, he would only

serve 5 months, whereas I imposed 85 months. A more appropriate correction of

                                                                                      2
Case 2:05-cr-00042-DBH Document 31 Filed 08/18/06 Page 3 of 4         PageID #: 66



the omission would be: 60 months on Count I and 85 months on Count II, the

first 60 months of which are served concurrently to Count I.

      The First Circuit, however, has said that “Rule 36 is considered generally

inapplicable to judicial errors and omissions” (citing a Seventh Circuit case).

United States v. Fahm, 13 F.3d 447, 454 n.8 (1st Cir. 1994) (emphasis original).

The error/omission here was mine, not the Clerk’s. I conclude, therefore, that I

cannot amend the judgment to reflect an allocation between Counts. I also see no

authority for making a correction under Rule 35(a) “nunc pro tunc” as the

government proposes. Rule 35(a)’s 7-day limit ran long ago. I therefore DENY the

second part of the motion.

      Nevertheless, I observe the following so as to clear up the Bureau of Prisons’

confusion. Not all 85 months can be served on Count I, the drug trafficking

count, because Count I carries a statutory maximum of 60 months. Serving 60

months on Count I followed (consecutively) by 25 months on Count II would partly

implement the sentence I imposed. Alternatively, the entire 85 months could also

all be served on Count II, the weapon count, which has a mandatory minimum

sentence of 120 months (here reduced because I granted the government’s motion

to depart under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e)). But if the defendant found a way to vacate

Count II, under each of these two scenarios he would end up serving a shorter

sentence than I imposed. On the other hand, I certainly did not intend the

defendant to serve 60 months on Count I and then an additional 85 months on

Count II. The proper execution of the 85-month sentence, therefore, is 60 months

on Count I and 85 months on Count II, the first 60 months of which are

                                                                                  3

concurrent to Count I.

      Accordingly, the motion to amend judgment is GRANTED so as to reflect that

the defendant was charged by Information and otherwise DENIED.

      SO ORDERED.
