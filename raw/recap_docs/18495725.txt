                       IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                         FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
          Plaintiff,
              v.                                  CR. NO. 05-277 (PG)
LASHAUN CASEY,
          Defendant.


                                      ORDER
     The government is seeking the death penalty as to defendant Lashaun
Casey. (Docket No. 14.) The death penalty is “unique in its severity and
irrevocability.”   Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153,       187 (1976) (internal
citations omitted).      Its finality therefore requires a greater degree of
reliability when it is imposed. See Lockett v. Ohio 438 U.S. 586, 604 (1978);
Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 290-98 (1972)(Brennan, J., concurring).
Indeed,    death   penalty   cases   require   extraordinary   procedural   and
substantive safeguards at every phase of the process.
     Death penalty prosecutions are unusual and complex cases requiring
appointment of learned counsel, extensive investigation and intensive
court involvement to properly case manage the proceedings without undue
delays consistent with fairness and due process. For these reasons it is
unreasonable to expect adequate preparation for factual proceedings or for
trial itself in this capital penalty case within the limits established
by the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. §3161.
     Here, DNA evidence has been collected from the scenes and has been
sent to the FBI lab for testing. Once the DNA results are ready, then the
latent prints will be examined. This process will take approximately one
month. Presently, the government is working on the Memorandum regarding
the death penalty certification which will be filed once the DNA results
are ready. (See Docket No. 58.)

     Furthermore, before the Court are several motions filed by the
government regarding discovery requests which also involve scientific
testing. (See Docket Nos. 17, 35, and 42.)       This evidence will put the
government in a better position to submit the case before the U.S.
Department of Justice. Defense counsel has filed extensive briefs in
response to the government’s requests. (See Docket Nos. 36 & 46.) In light
of the gravity of capital cases, the court must evaluate the parties’ motions
with extreme care. United States v. Valle-LaSalle, 36 F. Supp. 2d 445, 446
(D.P.R. 1999).
     Accordingly, the Court finds that the ends of justice outweigh the
interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial. See 18 U.S.C.
§3161(h)(8)(A) & (h)(8)(B)(ii). Therefore, the time that shall have
elapsed from August 30, 2005 until the Department of Justice notifies its
decision whether to seek the death penalty or not shall be excluded for
Speedy Trial purposes, without prejudice of other excludable time under
the Speedy Trial Act.


     IT IS SO ORDERED.

     In San Juan, Puerto Rico, June 5, 2006.
