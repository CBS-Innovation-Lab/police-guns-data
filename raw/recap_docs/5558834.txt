    JOINT STATUS REPORT OF GOVERNMENT AND DEFENDANT REGARDING
 APPLICATION OF 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) AND U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10 AND
            UNOPPOSED MOTION FOR REDUCTION IN SENTENCE

     The United States, by United States Attorney Michael J.

Sullivan and Assistant United States Attorney William Connolly,

and the defendant Javon Wooten, by defense counsel Timothy G.

Watkins, Assistant Federal Public Defender, respectfully submit

this memorandum to address the defendant’s eligibility for a

reduction in his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) and

U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10.    Pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Court’s

procedural order dated May 6, 2008, the parties have conferred

with each other and with United States Probation Officer Jennifer

Sinclair, and report as follows:

1.(a)     Defendant submits he is eligible for a reduction to 92
          months imprisonment; the government does not oppose the
          reduction because the Court, in departing from the
          career offender guideline, ultimately sentenced
          defendant within the otherwise applicable crack cocaine
          guideline range.

          (i)   General background of this case.

     On March 22, 2006, Wooten pled guilty before this Court to

possession of more than five (5) Grams of cocaine base, in
    Case 1:05-cr-10205-NG   Document 23   Filed 07/22/2008   Page 2 of 8



violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and possession of a firearm

by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. 922(g).            On

November 20, 2006, the Court sentenced Wooten to a term of 110

months imprisonment and a four year term of supervised release to

follow.    A copy of the Judgment is attached as Exhibit A to this

joint memorandum.    The sentence was imposed under the advisory,

post-Booker Sentencing Guidelines' regime, starting with a base

offense level computed under U.S.S.G. §2D1.1 for more than 5 but

less than 20 grams of crack cocaine, and including a two point

enhancement for possession of a weapon during a drug trafficking

offense.   The base offense level for the two offenses combined -

under the guidelines in effect at the time - was 28, reflecting a

base offense level of 26 for the crack cocaine and an additional

two points for the weapon.     Combined with application of the

"Career Offender" guideline pursuant to Guideline§ 4B1.1, the

level was enhanced to level 34.      Wooten received a three-point

reduction for acceptance of responsibility.        Application of the

Career Offender guideline automatically changed adjusted Wooten’s

criminal history category to a level VI, with a resulting

advisory guideline sentencing range of 188-235 months.

     The Court, however, imposed a sentence of 110 months, below

the advisory guideline sentencing range and at the bottom of the

pre-Career Offender guideline range driven the crack offense,

because the Court determined, both as a recognized pre-Booker


                                   -2-
    Case 1:05-cr-10205-NG   Document 23   Filed 07/22/2008   Page 3 of 8



departure ground and as a mitigating factor under Section

3553(a), that the career offender guideline overstated

defendant's particular criminal history.        See U.S.S.G. §4A1.3.

The Court appeared to have selected the 110 month sentence from

the low end of the crack-driven guideline sentencing range.                The

Court further relied on other § 3553(a) factors in selecting the

sentence of 110 months it ultimately imposed.

          (ii) Pertinent legal authority.

     During the past amendment cycle, the United States

Sentencing Commission amended the crack cocaine guidelines to

lower penalties in crack cocaine offenses.1        The amendments

(Amendment 706 as amended by 711) were the result of years of

critical study and analysis by the Commission.         See Kimbrough v.

United States, 128 S.Ct. 558, 568-69 (2007).         Effective March 3,

2008, the Commission voted unanimously to apply the crack cocaine

amendments retroactively to sentences that had otherwise become

final.

     Title 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) provides:

     [I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a
     term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has
     subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission
     pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant
     or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own
     motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after
     considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the
     extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is


     1
      Generally, the amendments reduce the offense level in crack
cocaine cases by two levels.

                                   -3-
    Case 1:05-cr-10205-NG   Document 23   Filed 07/22/2008   Page 4 of 8



     consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the
     Sentencing Commission.

     The governing Sentencing Commission policy statement is

U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10.    Section 1B1.10(a)(1) provides, in pertinent

part:

     (1)   In General.—In a case in which a defendant is serving a
           term of imprisonment, and the guideline range
           applicable to that defendant has subsequently been
           lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines
           Manual listed in subsection (c) below, the court may
           reduce the defendant’s term of imprisonment as provided
           by 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). . . .

(emphasis added).    Furthermore, where, as here, the court

downwardly departed from the applicable guideline sentencing

range at the original sentencing, § 1B1.10(b)(2)(B) provides that

a comparable departure from the new guideline range may be

appropriate:

     If the original term of imprisonment imposed was less than
     the term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range
     applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing, a
     reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range
     determined under subdivision (1) of this subsection may be
     appropriate. . . .

U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10(b)(2)(B).     Finally, the Commission’s crack

cocaine amendments are enumerated in § 1B1.10(c) as amendments

which may be applied retroactively.

     Defendant’s contention - which the government does not

oppose - is that application of the new crack cocaine amendments

lowers the guideline range applicable to the defendant because

the court based its sentence on the crack-driven guideline


                                   -4-
    Case 1:05-cr-10205-NG   Document 23   Filed 07/22/2008   Page 5 of 8



notwithstanding defendant’s initial designation as a career

offender, and that defendant is therefore eligible for a

reduction under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) and U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10.

     This Court, as well as two other sessions in the District of

Massachusetts, have denied relief to those initially sentenced

pursuant to the career offender guideline and who are now seeking

relief under the amended guideline.       See United States v. James

Gunn, Criminal No. 98-10185-NG (D.Mass., June 19, 2008)(oral

order denying relief); United States v. Conce, 2008 WL 2038901

(D.Mass. May 13, 2008)(Young, J.); United States v. Wilkey,

Docket # 98-10334-PBS (Unpublished Order, April 14, 2008), at

least two district courts have granted relief under the crack

cocaine amendment where, as the instant matter, the defendant was

nominally deemed a career offender but was sentenced below the

range by reference to the crack cocaine guideline.           United States

v. Poindexter, –- F.Supp.2d ----, 2008 WL 1946821 (E.D.PA, May 2,

2008);   United States v. Nigatu, 2008 WL 926561 (D. Minn. April

7, 2008).    In both Poindexter and Nigatu, the defendants were re-

sentenced to lower sentences to reflect the corresponding change

in the referenced guidelines.      Defendant thus contends that

relief is warranted under the reasoning set forth in these two

cases.

     1.(b)       Revised guideline calculation.

     The pre-career offender guideline was calculated employing a


                                   -5-
    Case 1:05-cr-10205-NG   Document 23   Filed 07/22/2008   Page 6 of 8



base offense level of 26, the level in effect at that time for

possession of between 5 and 20 grams of crack cocaine.            That base

offense level was enhanced by an additional two points - to 28 -

for possession of the weapon charged.       The base offense level was

reduced by three points, to a Total Offense Level of 25, to

reflect acceptance of responsibility.

     In the parties’ view, Wooten’s Total Offense Level (pre-

career offender) should now be reduced from 25 to 23, and the

pre-career offender guideline range thus reduced from 110-125

months to 92-115 months.     As noted, the government agrees that

defendant is eligible for a reduction given the Court’s reliance

on the crack guideline in imposing the original sentence.

     1.(c)      Recommendation for sentencing.

     The parties recommend a sentence of 92 months, the low-end

of the revised pre-career offender guideline sentencing range.

     1.(d)      Necessity for hearing; the defendant’s presence.

     The parties do not believe a hearing is necessary.            If the

Court deems a hearing necessary, defense counsel may request that

the defendant be permitted to appear via video conference.

     1.(e)      The earliest projected release date based on the
                low end of the revised guideline calculation.

     Defendant’s current release date is April 13, 2013.

Defendant will be eligible for release in October 2011 based on

the low-end of the revised pre-career offender guideline

calculation.

     1.(f)      Briefing schedule.

     The parties do not believe a briefing schedule is necessary

as the government does not oppose the reduction requested by

defendant.

     1.(g)      Necessity of transcript.

     The transcript of the sentencing hearing is attached hereto

as Exhibit B.

     1.(h)      Plea Agreement.

     There was no plea agreement in connection with the

disposition of this case.

     UNOPPOSED MOTION FOR REDUCTION OF SENTENCE PURSUANT TO
           18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) AND U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10

     Based upon the foregoing, defendant hereby moves the Court

to resentence the defendant pursuant to 18 U.S.C.

§ 3582(c)(2) and U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10 and to impose a sentence of 92

months.   The government assents.

     RESPECTFULLY submitted this 22nd day of July, 2008.

             G      Restitution Not Applicable.

       B      Total Amount of Restitution:

       C      Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

              1     G    For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
                         identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

              2     G    For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
                         issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
                         that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(B).

              3     G    For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
                         ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh
                         the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(1)(B)(ii).

              4     G    Restitution is not ordered for other reasons. (Explain.)




       D      G     Partial restitution is ordered for these reasons (18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)):



 VIII ADDITIONAL FACTS JUSTIFYING THE SENTENCE IN THIS CASE (If applicable.)

  I find that the defendant is not an Armed Career Criminal. The extraordinary increase in sentence in this case is because of
  the combination of the Career Offender guidelines and the crack cocaine disparity. Defendant's record-a District Court
  record-vastly overstates his culpability . Nevertheless, I will not depart below the range spelled out by the level 25 Criminal
  History Category VI, because of the gun chages in the defendant's record.

                PROCEEDINGS
THE CLERK: All rise.
THE COURT:   You can all be seated. I had to take time to
read the memo which I thought might be a good thing to do.
This is in Mr. Wooten's case. Has the government had an
opportunity to read the defendant's memo?
MR. CONNOLLY: I have, your Honor.
THE COURT:   You didn't file anything. Do you want to
argue?
MR. CONNOLLY: I had talked to Attorney Watkins about this a
while back. I prefer not to get into the legal merits of
the argument because it's my position that under the
circumstances of that particular case where he received a
guilty file.
THE COURT:   Right.
MR. CONNOLLY: My knowledge of what goes on and specifically
the Brockton District Court where I've practiced before that
under the circumstances of this case, I think you can use a
guilty file, but I think under the circumstances of this
particular case, I don't think it's appropriate to use it
here. I would ask the Court not to use it without making an
actual legal finding on the issue.
THE COURT:   I understand. Let's sort of deal with the
formalities of this. First, Mr. Wooten, would you please
stand. Can you raise your right hand.
(Defendant was sworn)
THE COURT:   Have you read the presentence report? You put
your hand down now. Have you read the presentence report?
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
THE COURT: Are there any other corrections in it other than
your lawyer has provided to you, anything else you want to
add to it factually?
THE DEFENDANT: My mother, my wife, my sisters, my brothers,
my cousin.
THE COURT: Oh, my. And the children?
THE DEFENDANT: My kids, too.
THE COURT: That's kind of important, don't you think?
THE DEFENDANT: Yes.
THE COURT: All right. Thank you. What is the government's
recommendation?
THE DEFENDANT: Your Honor, the government would ask for the
low end which I think comes out to 188.
THE COURT:   188 of the career offender guidelines?
MR. CONNOLLY: I'll just say a couple of words. I
understand that the defendant's asking for a significant
deviation and to the extent the Court's going to consider
it, I would just ask you to consider a couple things: 1,
although the career offender guidelines can certainly at
times be harsh, particularly in cases where the predicates
Case 1:05-cr-10205-NG   Document 23-3   Filed 07/22/2008   Page 3 of 10



result from District Court convictions, I think these
convictions I don't think fall necessarily at the lower end.
          I think they're at least somewhere in the middle
because I think they are serious domestic violence
incidents. One of them occurred while he was on probation
for the first one so I do think they're reasonably serious
predicates. It's not a situation where someone had, you
know, two guilty probations for a couple of barroom fights
or minor incidents or for a small drug case.
Secondly, I would say, I would point out to the Court even
if you cast aside the career offender guidelines, his range
would be 110 to 137 just on the guideline calculation with
his criminal history because this is a case where he gets
two criminal history category 6 on his own. He earned it.
I understand that it's mandated by the career offender
guideline, but if you put that to the side, he is a career
offender category 6.
Just finally I'd point out with the violent history,
obviously it demonstrated history of recidivism. I
recognize the familial report. I've read the presentence
report. It kind of cuts both ways. It's nice to see the
defendant in this courthouse has the support he has.
At the same time, it kind of puts him sadly almost in a
minority of defendants who come before this Court because he
had a very caring and interested mother, granted his father
stayed behind in Virginia, as you know, and a lot of
defendants we see in this defendant's position, they don't
have a single parent who has provided the support, and
clearly this defendant had a very caring mother as
demonstrated by the fact that she's adopted I think seven
children, so I would just simply ask the Court to consider
those factors if in fact the Court considers deviating from
the career offender guideline.
THE COURT: Mr. Watkins.
MR. WATKINS: Thank you, your Honor. Admittedly, this is
not an easy case to sort out. There's a lot of cognitive
dissonance here. In one sense the guideline is very high.
It's obviously boosted by the career offender status. His
record is difficult, and there's a substantial crime
underlying this. It is distribution of crack cocaine and
guns were found, things all of which are difficult things to
see.
The cognitive dissonance comes from the career offender
status particularly. While it's true he has a difficult
record, what we don't see are substantial prison sentences,
the kind of ladder that I think Congress particularly had in
mind when at first you get to the stage where they're
looking at a very, very stiff kind of sentence.
It is all District Court dispositions, and it's true it
includes some difficult cases where domestic violence were
Case 1:05-cr-10205-NG   Document 23-3   Filed 07/22/2008   Page 4 of 10



involved. Having said that, we don't see a lot of the
indicia that we I think ordinarily should see in these
career offender kind of cases. The Court has seen, and Mr.
 Connolly has pointed out the substantial, very significant
support from his family. Oftentimes we see in career
offender cases, a majority of the career offender cases,
people have burned their bridges, in addition to having the
serious criminal history burned their bridges by the long
prison sentence they've done and all of the different
chances that they've had.
That's not true for Mr. Wooten. In fact, it's quite the
opposite. He is now married to the punitive victim of one
of the domestic violence cases that makes him a career
offender, and she is fully supportive and he fully
supportive of her. Some of the children that he calls his
children are back here are actually her children that he's
become the father figure to.
And, similarly, his mother talks about the figure he's been
to the adopted siblings that he's had, and it's really
become the backbone or has always been the backbone for the
family over the years, really things we don't expect to see
in somebody that's been designated a career offender for
purposes of the sentencing guidelines.
As I pointed out, I think the breakdown comes from the way
the career offender guideline is built here in a person like
Mr. Wooten where it's the combination of the kind of street
level crime that Mr. Wooten had both in his past and in the
instant offense in combination with the kind of urban area
where he lives where an individual frankly is more likely to
be arrested and more likely to have the kinds of brushes
with the law, and the third thing that complicates it all is
the fact that there's the crack cocaine disparity which
pumps up the guideline both for the career offender purposes
and the underlying crime itself. As I pointed out, if there
were powder cocaine, we'd be looking at no mandatory minimum
and a sentence even with the guns in the range of 57 to 63
months.
So really the question is what do I do at this point? When
we look to the underlying reasons for the career offender,
it was Congress's decision and the Sentencing Commission
followed up on it that it's very easy to predict who is
going to be a recidivist. You look and you find two of
certain kinds of crimes and we know that that person for the
rest of their lives is going to be a problem that needs
protection of the public, and that means locking up for a
long period of time.
While that seems to break down in a case like Mr. Wooten's
here where he has that kind of support system where he has
relatively minor crimes, again, not to denigrate the
seriousness of any of them, but they are District Court
Case 1:05-cr-10205-NG   Document 23-3   Filed 07/22/2008   Page 5 of 10



kinds of dispositions so I think in that sense Congress and
the Sentencing Commission are wrong in a person like Mr.
 Wooten to say that those two crimes are going to be
indicators of long-term recidivism.
I think that quite the opposite is true here with Mr.
 Wooten. We have lots of indications why he's not going to
be a recidivist. I should say from Mr. Wooten's point of
view the five-year mandatory minimum is going to be enough.
It's a very, very substantial sentence given the past. He
is 29 years old. It's a very imperfectly, it's a time when
people who are in that kind of street life typically back
off it, and that seems to be the point where Mr. Wooten was.
He's going to have to do a serious sentence no matter what
the Court imposes here, and that may be enough. We simply
don't know.
Is it something in between those two ranges, the 15 years
and the 5 years? I would suggest that it probably is. I
was very torn about trying to come --
THE COURT:   Between the 15 years?
MR. WATKINS: Pardon me?
THE COURT:   There's a five-year mandatory minimum, there is
110 months you said for distribution of crack cocaine
without the career offender.
MR. WATKINS: That's correct, distribution of crack cocaine
and the two point bump for the guns.
THE COURT: Would be 110 months?
MR. WATKINS: Yes, and that would be strictly that. I would
suggest that is far more than enough in Mr. Wooten's case to
address the issue of what the Sentencing Commission thought
was important here which is whether an individual is going
recidivate or not.
110 months is nearly or just a little bit over nine years
which would put Mr. Wooten into his upper 30's, again,
empiricallly at an age we know where people have long since
stopped doing those kinds of behaviors, particularly who's
got the kind of support and shows the indicators he's
getting out of that particular kind of life. So I think
there are ample reasons under 3553A that the Court cannot
really, obviously the Court cannot cast aside and should not
cast aside the guideline sentencing range, but there are a
number of other indicators that would say that quite a bit
less is required here to effectuate that particular goal,
the recidivism goal.
I'm actually quite confident that Mr. Wooten once he does
whatever sentence this Court imposes on him is not going to
be any more of a danger to the community or any other kind
of goals that need to be addressed in this sentencing
statute. I'm quite convinced talking to his family, talking
to his wife and most importantly talking to him that this
really is the end of this criminal history here with this
Case 1:05-cr-10205-NG   Document 23-3   Filed 07/22/2008   Page 6 of 10



Federal Court indictment and the very long kind of sentence
that he's looking at. He has a family that he's committed
to, he's demonstrated that commitment. He was out on bail,
be it for a relatively short period of time, but, again he
demonstrated a break from his past.
THE COURT: Out on bail on the State charge that was the
underlying charge to this event?
MR. WATKINS: That's correct. And, again, it would have
been easy for him to perhaps leave the jurisdiction or go
back to doing the kinds of things he was doing. He didn't
do any of that. What he did was tried to take that time to
provide for his family knowing that a very serious kind of
trouble was ahead for him.
THE COURT:   The violence are the two episodes of domestic
violence?
MR. WATKINS: That's correct, that would be the two crimes
of violence that would make him a career offender at this
point. Beyond that it is again not to denigrate the
seriousness of his record, there are many criminal history
points there, but, on the other hand, it's relatively
speaking less serious kinds of crimes, a lot of possession
of cocaine. There are possession of firearms.
Again, while they are serious kinds of offenses, they are
the kinds of things we see in the inner city that Mr. Wooten
was in. I think the Court can be confident that it went
substantially under the careen offender guideline that Mr.
 Wooten is not going to be a risk to recidivate. I would
ask the Court to consider a sentence below that.
THE COURT:   Below the career offender, in other words,
below 158 months?
MR. WATKINS: It's actually 188 months.
THE COURT: With the crack cocaine?
MR. WATKINS: Because it's crack cocaine, it becomes a
40-year maximum, so it's kind of an enhanced career
offender, if you will, but I think the Court has mentioned
110 months. I would suggest even that is far more than
enough for Mr. Wooten.
THE COURT:   Mr. Wooten, do you have anything you want to
add? I welcome anything you have to say.
THE DEFENDANT: I'd just like to thank God that we're all
living today, thank my wonderful family for being with me
and all the wrong decisions I made. I would also like to
thank him for providing me with a good opportunity attorney
and the best Judge that there is in this country.
THE COURT:   Did he tell you to say that?
THE DEFENDANT: No, but I've heard a lot about you, and I've
heard a lot about you, and I know that you always are a fair
Judge.
THE COURT:   Do you want to tell me something about your
family in addition?
Case 1:05-cr-10205-NG   Document 23-3   Filed 07/22/2008   Page 7 of 10



THE DEFENDANT: I love them. They've been there for me from
day 1.
THE COURT:   All right. Give me a few minutes just to go
through this.
(A recess was taken.)
THE CLERK: All rise.
THE COURT:   You can be seated. I was struggling with your
sentence, and I really do, I was looking at one of the last
pages of Mr. Watkins' memo which I think frames this issue.
If Mr. Wooten, if this were powder and Mr. Wooten were not a
career offender, it would just be 57 to 63 months. If this
were crack and he weren't a career offender, it would be 110
months. If it were powder and he was a career offender, it
would be 151 months, and the combination of a career
offender and the crack disparity is 188 months.
It seems to me that that's a dramatic disparity not
justified by this case. There's no question that pre-Booker
Courts had a right to depart downward under      5A1.3 on
the nature of the record, and the record, I agree with you,
Mr. Watkins, does not justify the kind of bump that the
career offender provisions provide.
So that means that Mr. Wooten is somewhere between 110
months and 188 months. I understand that your argument
about the difference between crack and powder is an argument
that would put some of a downward pull even on 110 months,
and there will be a case that I will look at that more
carefully because whereas someone who distributes powder
cocaine at the lowest level can get a role adjustment, crack
is horizontally, there's a horizontal distribution, the
person gets it, cooks it and distributes it.
I would want to look who is in fact least culpable even as a
crack dealer. The problem here, and I agree with you that
this is a relatively small amount, dealing in a relatively
small amount. What keeps me from going below 110 months is
the guns and the violence. If it were only a record about
drug dealing, that would be one thing, but the guns and the
violence, even though the violence can be explained and
addressed, makes me unwilling to go below 110 months.
I think that's a very substantial sentence justified by in
part the crack powder disparity, in part by his record and
by the fact that there are guns and a record of violence and
not all the people who come here charged with crack offenses
have that, so while I appreciate the argument under U.S. v.
Foe that there's going to come a time, they'll be a
particular case where I'll say the crack powder disparity
doesn't make sense in this case, while the crack disparity
doesn't make sense in this case, there are other factors
that make sense in this case.
I appreciate that Mr. Wooten was trying to turn his life
around, and I'd love to have the Court of Appeals see what I
Case 1:05-cr-10205-NG   Document 23-3   Filed 07/22/2008   Page 8 of 10



see, which is this extraordinary family and supportive
family, and I appreciate that. That's the reason I will in
fact depart from the 188 months to 110 months. I will give
Mr. Wooten virtually almost half, half of the sentence that
he would otherwise get. I will do that.
I think 110 months reflects his record and reflects what he
has been charged with in this case and reflects some hope
for the future as well and reflects what 3553A requires, so
I'll accept the guideline calculations which are in the
presentence report which everyone has accepted.
I agree with both parties that it's not an armed career
criminal case in this particular case. I know the
government reserves the argument in other cases, and I look
forward to hearing those arguments in those other cases.
The career offender enhancement is extraordinary because of
the crack cocaine disparity and not justified by this record
which while a serious record, you know, is a record that has
an explanation, and the explanation has something to do
with, has an explanation in terms of factors which you can
control.
One factor was obviously reconciling yourself with your
wife, so that was one factor that you can control, and the
other factor is to get your life in order so that you so
that you can have a job and a family and obligations, so I'm
going to depart to actually I don't have a guideline book.
The guideline range then is total offenses of 25 and with
the career enhancement, that was up to career offender
enhancement, that was up to 31 with the criminal history 6
is 188. Under the career offender guidelines, I can decline
to enhance, that's what I'll do. I will decline to enhance
the offense level so the range is offense level 25, criminal
history 6 for a range of 110 to 137 months, and I'll
sentence you to 110 months.
Mr. Wooten, would you please stand. Thank you for your
comments. Thank you your family for coming. This is a
substantial reduction in the sentence you otherwise could
have gotten. I'm going to sentence you to 110 months. Your
time spent in state custody, in federal custody will be
credited, 110 months on each count to be served
concurrently.
While you're in prison, I will make a recommendation that
you participate in an anger management program, and though I
know that you said you didn't have a drug problem, I'm going
to recommend you participate in the 500-hour drug program.
If you do, it results in a reduction in your sentence if you
complete it successfully so there's really every incentive
for you to do that.
Upon your release, you're placed on supervised release for
four years on each count, all counts to run concurrently.
Within 72 of hours of your release, you're to report to the
Case 1:05-cr-10205-NG   Document 23-3   Filed 07/22/2008   Page 9 of 10



district into which you've been released. You're not to
commit another federal, state or local crime or possess an
illegal substance. You're to refrain from any unlawful use
of a controlled substance and submit to drug testing within
15 days of your release and at least two periodic drug tests
thereafter not to exceed 104 tests per year.
I will not require a DNA sample. That's still being
litigated. I don't want to impose it. You're to comply
with the standard conditions, and, in addition, you're
prohibited from possessing a firearm or other dangerous
weapon. You're to participate in an anger management
program as directed by probation, and you're to pay a
special assessment of $200, which is due immediately.
You understand that I've reduced the sentence as far as I
can go I think logically. The reason I'm not reducing it
any further is because of the guns and the violence in your
background. There would be no justification for going any
further. I think that 110 months is more than enough to
meet the purposes of sentencing, and somehow looking at the
faces in this room, I don't think there's any chance that
when you get out there will be any further conduct like
this. You have much, much too much to live for to repeat
this kind of conduct. I think you understand that. You
have a right to appeal, and your lawyer will let you know
what that consists of thank you.
THE CLERK: All rise.

p.m.)
