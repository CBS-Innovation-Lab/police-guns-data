   GOVERNMENT’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO REOPEN HIS
    2255 TO VACATE, SET ASIDE, OR CORRECT SENTENCE BY A PERSON IN
                           FEDERAL CUSTODY


 INTRODUCTION

        On July 12, 2004 Harry J. Burdick (“Burdick”) filed a Motion to Vacate, Set Aside,
 or Correct a Sentence by a Person in Federal Custody pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255
 (”2255 Motion”). That § 2255 Motion was denied on October 29, 2004. He never pursued
 any appeal. Waiting until November 6, 2009, Burdick only belatedly moved to reopen
 the time to file a notice of appeal (“Motion to Reopen”).1 For the reasons set forth below
 Burdick’s motion to reopen should be denied.

 ARGUMENT

        Burdick’s Motion to Reopen seeks additional time in which to appeal from the
 denial of his § 2255 Motion (CA No. 04-283 L Doc. #6).2 Burdick’s Motion to Reopen
 was filed over five years after entry of the judgement. In his Motion to Reopen, Burdick
 makes the dubious and unsupported claim that he simply did not know that he could
 appeal the order denying his § 2255 Motion. Burdick requests additional time to appeal
 based on his 14th Amendment right to Due Process. Burdick does not identify what his
 ground for appeal is or even attempt to establish why that appeal would be successful.


        1
          Burdick’s Motion to Reopen is not certified. The CMECF copy is electronically dated as
 filed on November 6, 2009.
        2
           Among his many procedural missteps, Burdick mistakenly filed this Motion to Reopen
 in his criminal case CR. No. 00-141-02 L (and further incorrectly designated the case number as
 “ML” rather than “L” in the caption). Burdick has actually moved to reopen the denial of his
 §2255 motion in CA No. 04-283 L.

         It stretches credulity that Burdick could have been unaware of his right to appeal
 for five years after the denial of his § 2255 Motion and just now be so enlightened. Even
 if believed, that claim demonstrates a total lack of due diligence. To the contrary, it is
 due process, the orderly process of law and the necessity for finality of judgment that
 compels that this motion be denied.

        An appeal from the denial of a § 2255 Motion requires a Certificate of
 Appealability (“COA”). See, e.g., Munoz v. United States, 331 F.3d 151 (1st Cir. 2003).
 Burdick has no COA. However, the timing of appeals is governed by Fed. R. App. P.
 4(a). United States v. London, 248 Fed. Appx. 889, 891 (10th Cir. 2007) (unpublished)
 (denying request for COA as untimely when filed beyond time allowed under the FRAP
 4).

         Under the provisions of Rule 4, any appeal by Burdick - either now or as of the
 time he filed his Motion to Reopen – would be untimely. He failed to file any notice of
 appeal within 60 days from the denial of his § 2255 Motion on October 29, 2004 (by
 December 27, 2004), as required by Rule 4(a)(1)(B), nor did he seek an additional 30
 days (until November 27, 2004 ) to do so under Rule 4(a)(5). Although a district court
 may re-open the time to file an appeal for up to 14 days under Rule 4(a)(6), Burdick
 likewise failed to timely request that action. Pursuant to Rule 4(a)(6)(B), a motion to re-
 set the time for appeal must be filed “within 180 days after the judgement or order is
 entered or within 7 days after the moving party receives notice of the entry [of
 judgment or ruling], whichever is earlier.” (Emphasis added.) See 28 U.S.C. §
 2107(c)(same). Burdick’s §2255 Motion was denied on October 29, 2004, but his Motion
 to Reopen was not filed until November 6, 2009, well past 7-day deadline and even after
 the 180-day deadline.

       The time requirements under Rule 4(a) are jurisdictional. See Bowles v. Russell,
 551 U.S. 205, 209-210 (2007). See also Couture v. United States, 620 F.Supp.2d 155, 158
 (D.Mass. 2009) (Rule 4(a)(6) deadline strictly enforced despite any unfairness). Thus,
 Burdick has no recourse at this juncture to appeal the denial of his § 2255 claim, and this
 Court cannot grant him the relief he seeks. It follows that Burdick’s motion to reopen
 must be denied.

 CONCLUSION

       For all the foregoing reasons, Burdicks Motion to Reopen the time to appeal this
 Court’s October 29, 2004 Order denying his § 2255 Motion should be denied.
