                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 09-cr-45-PB

Scott Rogers


                                  O R D E R


     Pro se defendant, Scott Rogers, has to continue the March 2,

2010 trial, citing a conflict of the trial date with trials

scheduled in state court and the need for additional time to

properly prepare for trial in this case.           The government does not

object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reasons and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from March 2, 2010 to May 4, 2010.             In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. § 3161(h)(7)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
