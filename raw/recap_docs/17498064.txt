              RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE


       The United States Magistrate Judge filed with the Court on September 14, 2010, his

Recommended Decision (Docket No. 61). Defendant filed his Objection to the Recommended

Decision (Docket No. 63) on October 1, 2010. Plaintiff filed its Response to Defendant’s Objection

to the Recommended Decision (Docket No. 64) on October 15, 2010.

       I have reviewed and considered the Magistrate Judge's Recommended Decision, together

with the entire record, including listening to the audio recording of the hearing; I have made a de

novo determination of all matters adjudicated by the Magistrate Judge's Recommended Decision;

and I concur with the recommendations of the United States Magistrate Judge for the reasons set

forth in his Recommended Decision, and determine that no further proceeding is necessary.

       1.       It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the Magistrate Judge
                is hereby AFFIRMED.
       2.     It is hereby ORDERED that Defendant’s Motion to Suppress and Dismiss (Docket
              No. 40) is DENIED.
