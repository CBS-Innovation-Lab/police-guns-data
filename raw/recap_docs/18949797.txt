                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                        DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

             v.                           Criminal No. 10-cr-37-02-JL

Rebecca Paulhus


                                  O R D E R


        The assented to motion to reschedule jury trial (document no.

21 ) filed by defendant is granted as there is no objection.

Continuance limited to 60 days; no further continuance without a

hearing. Final Pretrial is rescheduled to September 22, 2010 at

09:00am; Trial is continued to the two-week period beginning

October 5, 2010, 09:30.

        Defendant shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights within 10

days.    The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting

a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv), for the

reasons set forth in the motion.

        SO ORDERED.
