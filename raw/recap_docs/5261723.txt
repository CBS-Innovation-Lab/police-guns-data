          JOINT STATUS REPORT ON MOTION TO REDUCE SENTENCE


     In accordance with Standing Procedural Order 12-03, the

parties are hereby filing the following Status Report in this

matter:

     1.   Status of Jamaica Plain Filings

     The defense counsel has conferred with the government and

will shortly be filing a motion to vacate his drug conviction

and to be re-sentenced.    The government has indicated that it

will assent to this motion.     Mark W. Shea has been appointed to

represent the defendant.

     2.   Exchange of Information

     The defendant has been provided all discovery received from

the Massachusetts Attorney General to date related to the

investigation of the Jamaica Plain Lab.       Additionally, in the

automatic discovery produced by the government in the underlying

case, the defense counsel was provided with a copy of the drug

certifications (which were issued by Jamaica Plain Lab Chemists

Annie Dookhan and Della Saunders) dated August 29, 2006.

     3.   Position of the Parties

           A.   The government

     On September 30, 2008, the defendant, Amilton Araujo

(“Araujo”) pled guilty to Counts 1 and 2 of the indictment

without a plea agreement.     Count 1 charged Araujo with

possession with intent to distribute cocaine base a/k/a crack

cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).        Count 2 charged

Araujo with being a felon in possession of a firearm and

ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).         Araujo was

sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 60 months and to serve

four years of supervised release.      Araujo has already completed

his term of imprisonment and is currently on supervised release.

     As indicated in Section 1, the government will be assenting

to the defendant’s motion to vacate his drug conviction (Count

1) and to be re-sentenced.     If the Court allows the defendant’s

motion, the government will be seeking a sentence of time served

and three years’ supervised release at the re-sentencing because

the maximum sentence of supervised release the Court could

statutorily impose on the defendant for Count 2 (a Class C

felony) is three years.

B.   The Defendant

      If the court allows the defendant’s motion, the defendant

will be seeking a sentence of time served and two years’

supervised release at the re-sentencing.        As reason therefore,

the defendant maintains that the 60-month term of imprisonment

that he has already served is longer than the maximum guideline

sentence he would face with only the firearm conviction.

Defendant’s position is that the guideline range for only the

firearm conviction would be 37 - 46 months.         Because he has

served 14 months more than the high end of the new guideline

range, defendant would move for a two-year term of supervised

release, which has already been served.

      4.   Discovery

      The parties do not believe any further discovery is

necessary in this matter.

      5.   Defendant’s Status

      The defendant is currently on supervised release.

     6.   Appropriate Next Steps

     The defendant will be filing his motion to vacate his drug

conviction (Count 1) and to be re-sentenced.
