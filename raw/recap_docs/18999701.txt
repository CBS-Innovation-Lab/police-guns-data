                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                       DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

             v.                              Case No. 11-cr-137-01-SM

Rafael A. Corniel


                                    ORDER

      Defendant Corniel’s motion to continue the final pretrial conference and

trial is granted (document no. 15). No further continuances absent

extraordinary circumstances. Trial has been rescheduled for the April 2012 trial

period. Defendant Corniel shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights not later than

March 19, 2012. On the filing of such waiver, his continuance shall be

effective.

      The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18

U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would

unreasonably deny defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances.
