           ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION

      On January 2, 2014, the Court affirmed the Recommended Decision of the

Magistrate Judge and denied Cosme Sanchez Ramirez’s Motion to Vacate, Set Aside

or Correct Sentence and his Motion to Appoint Counsel.      Order Affirming the

Recommended Decision of the Magistrate Judge (ECF No 326) (Order). On January

13, 2014, using highly provocative language, Mr. Sanchez Ramirez moved for

reconsideration. Mot. for Recons. (ECF No. 327). Mr. Sanchez Ramirez’s original

motion requested that the Court grant relief on the ground that the United States

Supreme Court cases of Alleyne v. United States, 133 S. Ct. 2151 (2013), and

Descamps v. United States, 133 S. Ct. 2276 (2013), require that a jury determine

whether his prior convictions were proper predicate felonies under the Armed

Career Criminal Act (ACCA). Mot. to Vacate, Set Aside or Correct Sentence (2255)

(ECF No. 320).    The Magistrate Judge concluded that Mr. Sanchez Ramirez’s

petition was procedurally barred. Recommended Decision on 28 U.S.C. § 2255 Mot.

(ECF No. 323) (Recommended Decision).      Mr. Sanchez Ramirez objected to the

Recommended Decision.      Def.’s Objection to Recommended Decision of the

Magistrate Judge (ECF No. 324). The Court agreed with the Magistrate Judge’s
Recommended Decision but also noted that if the merits of Mr. Sanchez Ramirez’s

motion were reached, the result would be the same. Order at 1-4.

       In his motion for reconsideration, Mr. Sanchez Ramirez asserts that the

Court erred in its Order by failing to rule in his favor on the basis of Descamps.

Mot. for Recons. at 1-4. He argues that under Descamps, his prior convictions were

not violent felonies for purposes of the ACCA.             Id.   Mr. Sanchez Ramirez also

attaches a synopsis of a recent Eleventh Circuit decision, Bryant v. Warden, No. 12-

11212, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 25606 (11th Cir. Dec. 24, 2013).                    In Bryant, an

incarcerated inmate filed a 28 U.S.C. § 2241 habeas petition, claiming that an

earlier sentencing determination that a Florida state conviction for carrying a

concealed weapon was a violent felony under the ACCA was eclipsed by a later

United States Supreme Court decision, Begay v. United States, 553 U.S. 137 (2008).

The Eleventh Circuit ruled that the petition was not barred, because the petitioner

had satisfied the savings clause’s requirements in 28 U.S.C. § 2255(e). Bryant, 2013

U.S. App. LEXIS at *3-4. Mr. Sanchez Ramirez maintains that, like Bryant, the

Court may reach his Descamps argument under the savings clause. Finally, Mr.

Sanchez Ramirez filed an addendum to his motion on January 17, 2014, contending

that Wood v. Milyard, 132 S. Ct. 1826 (2012), also “control[s] this court and its

decisions.” Addendum to Mot. for Recons. (ECF No. 328).

       Looking past Mr. Sanchez Ramirez’s hyperbolic language, his motion for

reconsideration must fail.1 First, the Magistrate Judge’s Recommended Decision


1     Mr. Sanchez Ramirez describes the Court’s affirmance of the Magistrate Judge’s
Recommended Decision as “an absolute travesty of justice,” asserts that the Court has “dishonored

                                               2
and this Court’s de novo determination affirming that recommended decision

encompassed Mr. Sanchez Ramirez’s asserted right to relief under Descamps.

Recommended Decision at 2-3; Order at 1, 3-4.

       Next, the same legal question Mr. Sanchez Ramirez now raises—whether his

prior state convictions were violent felonies—was raised on appeal to the First

Circuit, and the First Circuit ruled against him.2 United States v. Sanchez Ramirez,

570 F.3d 75, 81-83 (1st Cir. 2009). The Court does not conclude that the Supreme

Court case of Descamps allows for reconsideration of the First Circuit decision based

on intervening Supreme Court authority, under the savings clause in § 2255(e),

because Descamps does not allow any relief to Mr. Sanchez Ramirez. In Descamps,

the Supreme Court distinguished between so-called “divisible” and “indivisible”

statutes, a “divisible” criminal statute being “[t]hat kind of statute set[ting] out one

or more elements of the offense in the alternative—for example, stating that

burglary involves entry into a building or an automobile.” Descamps, 133 S. Ct. at

2281 (emphasis in original). For these “divisible” statutes, the Descamps Court

reiterated that a sentencing court may look beyond the statute and review Shepard3

documents “to determine which of a statute’s alternative elements formed the basis

of the defendant’s prior conviction.” Id. at 2284. The Supreme Court concluded

that a sentencing court should not resort to Shepard documents for “indivisible”



its oath,” demands that the Court “not allow itself to be made an accomplice in a wilful disobedience
of law,” and urges the Court to apply “the best of laws, those of your betters, the Supreme Court of
the United States.” Mot. for Recons. at 1-4.
2       The Court addressed the Alleyne issue in its affirmance and Mr. Sanchez Ramirez has not
moved for reconsideration of that part of the Court’s Order.
3       Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13 (2005).

                                                 3
statutes, where “no uncertainty of that kind exists.”      Id. at 2286.    Descamps,

therefore, potentially affects the subset of ACCA determinations where the

sentencing court, though faced with an indivisible statute, examined Shepard

documents to determine whether the state crime fit within the ACCA definition of a

violent felony.

      As it turns out, the Florida burglary statute under which Mr. Sanchez

Ramirez was thrice convicted of burglary is a divisible statute, because it

criminalized the “entering or remaining in a dwelling, a structure, or a conveyance

with the intent to commit an offense, therein, unless the premises are at the time

open to the public or the defendant is licensed or invited to enter or remain.” FL.

STAT. § 810.02(1) (1994). As this Court pointed out in 2007, “[t]he inclusion of

conveyances, which Florida law defined as ‘any motor vehicle, ship, vessel, railroad

vehicle or car, trailer, aircraft, or sleeping car,’ makes section 810.02 broader than

the generic definition of burglary, which is limited to a building or structure.”

United States v. Sanchez Ramirez, No. CR-05-71-B-W, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS

94146, *7 (D. Me. Dec. 21, 2007).     In short, because Mr. Sanchez Ramirez was

convicted of burglary under a divisible state burglary statute, Descamps does not

apply to his case. As Descamps does not implicate the First Circuit’s conclusion in

Sanchez Ramirez, Mr. Sanchez Ramirez is not entitled to challenge, in a § 2241 or §

2255 petition, the same legal issue previously raised and resolved against him by

the First Circuit. 28 U.S.C. § 2255(e); see Descamps, 133 S. Ct. at 2283-86; Sanchez

Ramirez, 570 F.3d at 82-83.



                                          4
       Finally, turning to Mr. Sanchez Ramirez’s addendum, by referring the Court

to Wood, Mr. Sanchez Ramirez seems to be contending that the Court erred in

concluding that his claim was procedurally barred.4 Wood, however, does not assist

Mr. Sanchez Ramirez. There, the Supreme Court reversed the Tenth Circuit’s sua

sponte decision to raise on appeal the timeliness of a habeas petition and then

dismiss the petition as untimely, after the Government had expressly declined to

oppose the petition on this ground before the district court. Wood, 132 S. Ct. at

1829, 1834-35. Here, the Government has never “deliberately steered the District

Court away from the question and towards the merits” of the habeas petition, and

in fact this Court addressed the merits of Mr. Sanchez Ramirez’s motion, both in the

previous Order and in this Order. Wood does not assist Mr. Sanchez Ramirez.5

       The Court DENIES Cosme Sanchez Ramirez’s Motion for Reconsideration.

(ECF No. 327).

       SO ORDERED.

                                     CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE

Dated this 21st day of January, 2014

4       The Court says “seems to be” because Mr. Sanchez Ramirez simply cites Wood v. Milyard as
controlling but does not explain why.
5       Wood v. Milyard does not apply here for two other reasons. First, the procedural issue in
Wood was a statute of limitations defense. 132 S. Ct. at 1829. Here, by contrast, the procedural
issue is jurisdictional—the Magistrate Judge concluded that the Court of Appeals, not the district
court, has jurisdiction to make a preliminary determination on Mr. Sanchez Ramirez’s petition.
Recommended Decision at 2-3. Second, in a case where the parties had agreed that the petition was
not procedurally barred and the district court had reached the merits, the Wood Court addressed
whether the Court of Appeals was justified in concluding that the petition was nevertheless
procedurally barred and concluded that it was not. See 132 S. Ct. at 1835. That analysis does not
implicate the law that a district court must apply in addressing habeas petitions.
