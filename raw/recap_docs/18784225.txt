                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                         DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                   Criminal No. 04-cr-144-01-JD

Jeremy Johnson


                                  O R D E R

     On July 26, 2006, defendant appeared for a “probable cause”

hearing under Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.1 on seven alleged violations

of conditions of supervision.         Defendant stipulated to probable

cause on the violations.        I therefore find probable cause to hold

him for a revocation hearing.

     Defendant sought bail conditions under Rule 32.1(a)(6).

Under Rule 32.1(a)(6) defendant bears the burden of establishing

by clear and convincing evidence that he will not flee and that

he poses no danger to any other person or to the community.              The

defendant has been missing since April and has failed to submit

to testing, has tested dirty, and missed numerous drug treatment

appointments.      He is a risk of flight and a danger to the

community.     There are no conditions which are likely to assure

his presence and the safety of the community.

     Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the defendant be detained

pending trial.

      The defendant is committed to the custody of the Attorney

General or his designated representative for confinement in a

corrections facility separate, to the extent practicable, from

persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody

pending appeal.     The defendant shall be afforded a reasonable

opportunity for private consultation with defense counsel.             On

order of a court of the United States or on request of an

attorney for the government, the person in charge of the

corrections facility shall deliver the defendant to the United

States Marshal for the purpose of an appearance in connection

with a court proceeding.

      SO ORDERED.
