STATEMENT OF REASONS

Vll COURT DETERMINATIONS OF REST|TUTION
A E Restitution Not Applicable.
13 'fotal Amount of Restitution:
C Restitution not ordered (Cheel< only one.):

l \:] For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(e)(3]{A).

f\)

\:l For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex

issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount ofthe vietims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim WouId be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C`. § 3663A(c)(3)(3).

3 i:l For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under |S U,S.C. § 3603 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines restitution is not

ordered because the complication and prolongation ofthe sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh
the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 tT.S.C. §3663ta)(l)(B)(ii).
