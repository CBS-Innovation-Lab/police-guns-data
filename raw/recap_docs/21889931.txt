JAMES WARNER,                              )

                             SENTENCING MEMORANDUM

      The government is bound by the plea agreement pursuant to which the government

agreed to a low-end recommendation with the following Sentencing Guidelines: Base Offense

Level 20 and a 4-level enhancement for trafficking in firearms under Section 2K2.1(b)(5). As

noted by the PSR, the proper Base Offense Level is now a 14 based on post-Johnson

precedents.

      The PSR also identifies a potential additional 4-level enhancement under Section

2K2.1(b)(6). The government is not seeking this enhancement per the plea agreement, and the

government notified Probation of a recent Second Circuit decision (United States v. Young, 811

F.3d 592, 599-604 (2nd Cir. 2016)) which supports that the enhancement under Section

2K2.1(b)(6) is not merited. As a result, the applicable Sentencing Guidelines range is 24-30

months, and the government will recommend 24 months per the plea agreement.

                                                    Respectfully submitted,

                                                    WILLIAM D. WEINREB
