               ORDER AFFIRMING RECOMMENDED DECISION
                      OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE


      On April 10, 2018, the United States Magistrate Judge filed with the court,
with copies to the parties, his Recommended Decision on 28 U.S.C. ยง 2255
Motion. The time within which to file objections expired on April 24, 2018, and
no objection has been filed. The Magistrate Judge notified the parties that failure
to object would waive their right to de novo review and appeal.
      It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the Magistrate
Judge is hereby ADOPTED. The motion for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. ยง 2255
is DENIED without an evidentiary hearing. No certificate of appealability pursuant
to Rule 11 of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Cases shall issue because there
is no substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right within the
meaning of 28 U.S.C. ยง 2253(c)(2).

      SO ORDERED.

      DATED THIS 8TH DAY OF MAY, 2018

                                               /S/D. BROCK HORNBY
