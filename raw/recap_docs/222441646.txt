                           MEMORANDUM AND ORDER

 Mary S. McElroy, United States District Judge.

       Mr. Montalvo, indicted on three counts of drug trafficking and possession of

 an unlawful firearm, has moved to suppress tangible evidence three times; the

 previous two motions — to suppress fentanyl, the firearm, and photographs taken

 inside his apartment — were denied. (ECF No. 32 and Text Order, March 16,

 2022.) This third motion seeks to suppress a cellphone seized from Mr. Montalvo at

 the time of his arrest as well as all evidence gleaned from the data on the phone.

       The Court has determined that the record, developed with respect to those

 earlier motions which included an evidentiary hearing (ECF Nos. 55, 56), is

 adequate to rule on this third motion. For the reasons stated below, Mr. Montalvo’s

 third motion to suppress (ECF No. 58) is DENIED.

                          I.     FACTUAL BACKGROUND

       The facts leading to the seizure of the cellphone began with the seizure of 30

 grams of fentanyl from a confidential source (“C.S.”) who told Pawtucket police that

 Mr. Montalvo and his girlfriend had supplied the drugs. (ECF No. 55, at 6.) The

 C.S. supplied names and addresses for both Mr. Montalvo and Erin Lawrence who,

 police had learned, lived together, and he identified Mr. Montalvo from

 photographs. The source claimed to have had personal knowledge of Mr. Montalvo

 dealing fentanyl over the course of five years. Id. at 11.

       The source supplied a phone number which police were able to determine was

 associated with Mr. Montalvo. At the behest of police, the source made several

 unsuccessful attempts to call Mr. Montalvo to set up a drug buy. (ECF No. 25.) The

 police then commenced a surveillance of Mr. Montalvo which culminated in their

 search and seizure of four trash barrels he had placed on the curb for pickup outside

 of his home. The Court, in denying the first motion to suppress, upheld the

 constitutional admissibility of the fentanyl residue and other items indicative of

 drug-dealing found in those barrels. As a result of that seizure, police obtained a

 warrant to search Mr. Montalvo’s apartment. (ECF No. 32.)

       Meanwhile, before that warrant was executed, police stopped Mr. Montalvo

 after he drove away from his residence and arrested him. 1 Id. at 29, 34, 102. While



 1 Although police initially referred to Mr. Montalvo as “detained,” ECF No. 55, at
 30, the government has at times referred to its action as an “arrest,”e.g., ECF No.
 62, at 8. It is clear from the testimony that Mr. Montalvo was arrested. He was not
 free to leave, would have been stopped had he tried to, and was taken immediately
 after the stop to the police station. (ECF No. 55, at 152, 153). Det. Dennis Smith
                                            2
Case 1:19-cr-00134-MSM-LDA Document 63 Filed 01/13/23 Page 3 of 8 PageID #: 527




 arresting him based on the evidence found in the trash barrels, police seized the

 cellphone that is the object of this motion to suppress. 2 Id. at 103. Mr. Montalvo

 was taken from where his vehicle was stopped to the Pawtucket police station. Id.

 at 153. The contents of the phone were not searched until after police obtained a

 separate search warrant authorizing that search.

       Mr. Montalvo alleges there was no justification for the seizure of the phone.

 His challenge to the introduction into evidence of the contents of the phone

 therefore stems from what he claims is an unlawful arrest and an unlawful seizure,

 making the contents of the phone the fruits of the these allegedly unlawful

 activities. While he contends that the later warrant to search the phone did not

 “cure” the unlawful seizure, Mr. Montalvo has not challenged the sufficiency of the

 warrant itself. See Motion to Suppress, ECF No. 58.

                                    II.   ANALYSIS

       The Court begins with the starting point for all challenges brought under the

 Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution: any search or seizure

 carried out without a warrant issued upon probable cause is presumptively

 unlawful and is justified only if it falls within a specific exception to the warrant


 testified that at the time of the stop he “believe[d] we had more than enough
 probable cause to arrest him with possession with intent.” Id. at 29. Another
 officer, although not at the scene, acknowledged that Mr. Montalvo was arrested
 when or moments after he was “detained.” (ECF No. 55, at 148.)
 2Mr. Montalvo’s keys to his residence were seized at the same time and police used
 those keys when they entered the apartment. Mr. Montalvo does not challenge the
 seizure of the keys. In light of the warrant police later obtained to enter and search
 the apartment, any challenge to the entry based on an unlawful seizure of the keys
 would fail as it was justified pursuant to the independent source of the warrant.

 requirement. Riley v California, 573 U.S. 373, 382 (2014). When the government

 seeks to exploit such a search or seizure by introducing into evidence incriminating

 items found, it bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that

 an exception to the warrant requirement justified the absence of a warrant. United

 States v. Matlock, 415 U.S. 164, 177 (1974).

          One such exception occurs when a person is lawfully arrested and is carrying

 – or has within his immediate control – items that are reasonably believed to be

 contraband or evidence of the crime for which he is arrested. When a person is

 arrested in a vehicle, as Mr. Montalvo was, “it is ‘reasonable to believe evidence

 relevant to the crime of arrest might be found in the vehicle.’” Arizona v. Gant, 556

 U.S. 332, 343 (2009), quoting Thornton v. United States, 541 U.S. 615, 632 (2004).

 In that event, police may seize the item “incident to the arrest”; the seizure is lawful

 if the arrest itself was lawful and if the item was likely contraband or evidence of a

 crime.

          In this case, Mr. Montalvo’s arrest was clearly lawful. It occurred in a public

 place which obviated the need for an arrest warrant. United States v. Watson, 423

 U.S. 411, 423-24 (1976). The lawfulness of a warrantless arrest depends upon

 whether, “at the time of the arrest, the ‘facts and circumstances within the officer's

 knowledge ... are sufficient to warrant a prudent person, or one of reasonable

 caution, in believing, in the circumstances shown, that the suspect has committed,

 is committing, or is about to commit an offense.’” Silva v. Rhode Island, 527 F.

 Supp. 3d 168, 176 (D.R.I. 2021) (citing Holder v. Town of Sandown, 585 F.3d 500,



                                              4
Case 1:19-cr-00134-MSM-LDA Document 63 Filed 01/13/23 Page 5 of 8 PageID #: 529




 504 (1st Cir. 2009). “The inquiry into probable cause focuses on what the officer

 knew at the time of the arrest, and should evaluate the totality of the

 circumstances.” United States v. Jones, 432 F.3d 34, 41 (1st Cir. 2005) (internal

 citations omitted). Probable cause means “…the kind of ‘fair probability’ on which

 ‘reasonable and prudent [people] act.’” Florida v. Harris, 568 U.S. 237, 244 (2013).

       There were two facts from which probable cause to arrest arose in this case.

 First, when the confidential source was found in possession of 30 grams of fentanyl,

 he claimed he had bought it from Mr. Montalvo and his girlfriend. That established

 the C.S.’s personal knowledge of the incriminating event. While the source was a

 first-time informant, the details he gave about Mr. Montalvo, his address, and his

 telephone number, were corroborated, and he identified Mr. Montalvo from several

 different pictures. 3 (ECF No. 55, at 7.) Even the corroboration of innocent, non-

 incriminating details may provide a basis for crediting an informant. United States




 3 The Motion to Suppress filed by the defendant alleges, in purely general terms, a
 lack of probable cause. (ECF No. 58.) Although the defendant has known the story
 leading up to his arrest since at least the time of the evidentiary hearing, there is
 no claim in the Motion that the confidential source lacked reliability or credibility.
 Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 244-45 (1983) (totality of the circumstances may
 provide a substantial basis for crediting an informant’s information). A motion to
 suppress must allege with particularity the grounds upon which it is based and it is
 not up to the Court to supply theories. There was no memorandum of law filed with
 the Motion which might have otherwise raised a complaint about reliance on the
 source’s allegations. Nor has the defendant requested a hearing or opportunity to
 orally argue. See United States v. Calderon, 77 F.3d 6, 9 (1st Cir. 1996)
 (evidentiary hearing required only where defendant “allege[s] facts, ‘sufficiently
 definite, specific, detailed, and nonconjectural, to enable the court to conclude that a
 substantial claim is presented.’” Despite the defendant’s failure to challenge the
 police reliance on the source’s information, the Court does address that issue as well
 as the question of whether the quantity of information established probable cause.

 v. Dixon, 787 F.3d 55, 59 (1st Cir. 2015); United States v. Greenburg, 410 F.3d 63,

 69 (1st Cir. 2005). Importantly, the source’s central accusation, that Mr. Montalvo

 was dealing fentanyl, was corroborated independently by the evidence police found

 in the lawful search of the trash barrels. Moreover, the source was known to the

 police and was not anonymous. Florida v. J.L., 529 U.S. 266, 270 (2000) (known

 informant’s tip more reliable than anonymous tip).

       Second, and more directly, the police had clear probable cause that Mr.

 Montalvo possessed the fentanyl found in the trash barrels they saw him placing on

 the curb and removing from the curb after the trash pick-up. The Court has already

 upheld the search of the barrels and seizure of the fentanyl. The indicia of

 ownership of the barrels and their contents that police observed was sufficient to

 connect Mr. Montalvo to possession of the fentanyl and to arrest him for it. (ECF

 No. 55, at 95) (testimony from police detective that “I have probable cause to arrest

 him based off the trash pull.”).

       If an arrest is lawful, police may search both the arrestee and the area within

 his immediate control for contraband and evidence of the crime. Arizona v. Gant,

 556 U.S. 332, 343 (2009); Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 762-763 (1969) (“it is

 entirely reasonable for the arresting officer to search for and seize any evidence on

 the arrestee's person in order to prevent its concealment or destruction”.)

       Generally, police who find a cell phone during a search incident to arrest may

 seize the phone. 4 United States v. Olivera, Cr. No. 21-12 (DRD), 2022 WL 3334607,

 at *9 (D.P.R. Aug. 12, 2022). Cell phones are “common tools of the drug trade,”

 United States v. Hernandez-Mieses, 931 F.3d 134, 140 (1st Cir. 2019), and,

 therefore, it is a fair inference that a cellphone found in the possession of a person

 reasonably believed to be dealing drugs is evidence of that crime. Mr. Montalvo was

 carrying the cellphone at the time of his arrest. (ECF No. 55, at 115.) Police had

 probable cause specific to Mr. Montalvo to believe that he conducted his drug-

 dealing business by telephone. The informant alleged having purchased 30 grams

 of fentanyl from Mr. Montalvo and, just prior to Mr. Montalvo’s arrest, had

 attempted to make another purchase by calling his cellphone. There was testimony

 that on a previous occasion the informant had, by telephone, arranged to meet Mr.

 Montalvo to purchase fentanyl. Id. at 59. It appears that Mr. Montalvo was

 carrying only the one cellphone, as police seized no others. The inference, therefore,

 is strong that the cellphone seized was an instrumentality of the crime and

 therefore within the “search incident to arrest” umbrella.

                                 III.   CONCLUSION

       The seizure of Mr. Montalvo’s cellphone was lawful. The later search of its

 contents was carried out pursuant to a warrant whose sufficiency is not challenged.



 4Authority to seize the phone is not authority to search its contents. Once the
 phone is in their possession, police are required to obtain a warrant justifying the
 search of the data on the phone. Riley v. California, 573 U.S. 373, 401 (2014), In
 this case, a warrant was obtained and the sufficiency of the affidavit and the
 warrant are not challenged.

 Therefore, both the cellphone and its contents are admissible and Mr. Montalvo’s

 Motion to Suppress (ECF No. 58) is DENIED.


 IT IS SO ORDERED:
