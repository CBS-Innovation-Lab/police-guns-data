TAURO, J.

I.     Introduction

       Defendant Jose Shaw was indicted on one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm

and ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).1 Currently before the court is Defendant’s

Motion to Suppress Evidence [#46].

II.    Background

       A.      Findings of Fact

       In the early morning hours of December 4, 2009, Brockton Police Detectives George

Almeida and Samuel Carde were on patrol.2 The officers were dressed in plain clothes and were

driving an unmarked police vehicle.3 At approximately 2 a.m., Detective Almeida received a

Nextel Direct Connect communication from off-duty Brockton Police Detective Erik Hilliard.4

similar to a “walkie-talkie.” It is a one way communication, where an individual speaks and the
Detective Hilliard told Detective Almeida that, “he was receiving information from a confidential

reliable informant [describing] two Cape Verdean males in the area of Crescrent Street and . . .

Maple Ave. [in Brockton].”5

       The confidential informant was known to Detective Hilliard and had provided reliable

information to Detective Hilliard on three previous occasions, beginning in 2007.6 The

informant’s information had, in the past, led to the seizure of two handguns, and to one arrest and

prosecution.7 In this case, the informant told Detective Hilliard that he had observed two

individuals with a gun at a local bar, and the informant proceeded to give Detective Hilliard a

detailed description of the two men, including their race, clothing, and location.8 While the

informant was communicating this information to Detective Hilliard on Detective Hilliard’s

personal cell phone, Detective Hilliard relayed the information to Detective Almeida via Nextel

Direct Connect.9

       The confidential informant told Detective Hilliard that he was following the two suspects

in his car.10 Detective Hilliard relayed to Detective Almeida the informant's description of the two




other listens. Once one person has finished speaking, the other may then re-connect and speak.).

Detective Hilliard indicated that one suspect was wearing a red hat, red sweatshirt, and blue jeans,

and that the other was wearing a black hat, black sweatshirt and black jeans.12 Detective Hilliard

received continuous updates from the informant, and was able to give Detective Almeida the

precise location of the suspects. Detectives Almeida and Carde followed Detective Hilliard’s

directions and found the suspects on Perkins Street near Crescent Street in Brockton.13

Detectives Almeida and Carde were followed by Officer Louis, a uniformed officer in a marked

police cruiser.14

        Upon crossing Crescent Street on to Perkins Street, Detective Almeida testified that he,

“observed two Cape Verdean looking males fitting [the informant’s] description, one wearing a

red hat, red sweatshirt, blue jeans. The other one . . . wearing a black hat, black sweatshirt, and

black jeans.”15 As he and Detective Carde approached the two men, Detective Almeida

recognized the one dressed in black as Peter Teixeira, also known as “Hurt Neck.”16 Detective

Almeida knew at the time that Teixeira had a criminal record and was ineligible for a license to

carry a firearm because he was previously convicted of a felony.17 Detective Almeida did not

       Detective Carde then positioned the unmarked cruiser on the east side of the street,

approximately twenty feet from where the two suspects were located, and without activating the

lights or drawing their weapons, the two detectives exited the vehicle.19 Detective Louis

positioned his cruiser beside, and slightly behind Detectives Carde and Almeida’s vehicle.20

Detective Almeida called out, “Yo, ‘Hurt Neck,’ can I holler at you for a minute,” to which

Teixeira responded, “Yo, Almeida, what’s up.”21 At the same time, Teixeira turned to face the

detectives, while his companion, now known to be Defendant Shaw, turned away from the

detectives, “blading his body.”22

       Detective Almeida testified that “blading” is a defensive gesture designed to remove a

weapon from a potential opponent’s line of sight. The armed individual essentially turns so that

the weapon is on the side of his body furthest from the opponent. Police are trained to do this,

and according to Detective Almeida, most armed individuals that they encounter typically do the

same.23 At this point, after Teixeira responded to Detective Almeida’s question, Detective

Almeida requested that the men keep their hands where they could be seen, and Teixeira moved

his hands toward the front pocket of his sweatshirt.24

       This gesture prompted Detective Carde to remove his service weapon and demand to see

the men’s hands.25 Teixeira immediately complied with the request, but Defendant Shaw was

slower to react.26 Defendant Shaw remained with his back toward the detectives, and continued

blading his body, looking over his shoulder.27 The detectives approached Teixeira and Shaw and

asked the men to face away from them.27 At this point Officer Drane arrived in a third cruiser,

which he positioned in front of the two suspects.28 While Detective Carde kept his service

weapon on the two suspects, Officer Drane stepped up to Shaw and Officer Louis stepped up to

Teixeira.29 The officers proceeded to pat-frisk the two suspects.30

       Upon pat-frisking the right side of Defendant’s waist band, Officer Drane shouted,”I got

one,” indicating that he had found a firearm, and both suspects were ordered to their knees.31 At

that moment, a fourth cruiser arrived driven by Officer Kalp.32 Officer Drane removed the gun

from Defendant Shaw’s waistband, and the magazine fell out of the gun in the process. Officer

Drane immediately passed the gun and magazine to Officer Kalp, who secured them in the trunk

of his cruiser.33 Officer Drane demanded to see Defendant Shaw’s license to carry the gun, and

Defendant Shaw responded that he did not have one.34 Defendant Shaw was charged with being a

felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), and now

seeks to suppress the gun found by Officer Drane as the fruit of an illegal search.

       B.      Procedural History

       On March 2, 2010, the government filed a criminal complaint against Defendant, and an

arrest warrant was issued. On March 3, 2010, Defendant was arrested, and on March 4, 2010,

counsel was appointed. On April 7, 2010, a grand jury indicted Defendant on one count of being

a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition. On April 13, 2010, Defendant was arraigned

before Magistrate Judge Bowler. On September 6, 2011, Judge Bowler held a final status

conference, and subsequently issued a Report and Order. On October 27, 2011, Defendant filed a

Motion to Suppress Evidence [#46]. After a hearing held on January 12, 2012 and continued on

March 15, 2012, the court took the matter under advisement.

III.   Discussion

       Defendant moves to suppress the gun and ammunition seized by the Brockton Police

Department on the grounds that the December 4, 2009 search was in violation of his Fourth

Amendment rights.35 Whether the search of Defendant Shaw was in violation of his Fourth

Amendment rights raises two questions that must be addressed in sequence. First, whether the

officers had a reasonable suspicion that Defendant Shaw was engaged in criminal activity at the

time he was “seized” under the Fourth Amendment, and next, whether the scope of the search

was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment in light of the circumstances leading up to it.

       A.      Legal Standard

       The Fourth Amendment proscribes unreasonable searches and seizures of individuals’

persons, homes, papers, or effects.36 While a stop and subsequent frisk of an individual falls within

the ambit of the Fourth Amendment,37 the Supreme Court held in Terry v. Ohio, that “a police

officer may in appropriate circumstances and in an appropriate manner approach a person for

purposes of investigating possibly criminal behavior even though there is no probable cause to

make an arrest.”38 The standard of proof for a seizure under Terry is that, “a police officer is

permitted to make a brief investigatory stop of an individual if the officer has reasonable suspicion

that criminal activity may be afoot.”39 The First Circuit has elaborated by emphasizing that a “so-

called Terry stop ‘lies somewhere between a consensual encounter and a full blown arrest,’” and

must be supported by an officer’s reasonable suspicion, which is more than a hunch, but less than

would be required to find probable cause.40

                                                  7
       In order to effect a lawful Terry stop, an officer must have reasonable suspicion at the

time that the suspect is seized for Fourth Amendment purposes. An otherwise innocuous

encounter between a citizen and a police officer, “rises to the level of a seizure when the

interaction is compelled by physical restraint or a nonphysical show of authority rather than by the

citizen’s voluntary compliance.”41 As most individuals inherently feel a degree of compulsion

when questioned by law enforcement, courts apply an objective standard to determine whether the

encounter was sufficiently coercive to rise to the level of a seizure under the Fourth

Amendment.42 “In the absence of evidence of coercion, ‘otherwise inoffensive contact between a

member of the public and the police cannot, as a matter of law, amount to a seizure of that

person.’”43

       In determining if a seizure has occurred, “the crucial test is whether, taking into account

all of the circumstances surrounding the encounter, the police conduct would ‘have

communicated to a reasonable person that he was not at liberty to ignore the police presence and

go on about his business.’”44 Circumstances that might transform a consensual encounter into a

seizure include, “the threatening presence of several officers, the display of the officers’ weapons,

any physical touching of the defendant, and the use of language or tone of voice that indicates that

                                               8
compliance with the officers’ request is not discretionary.”45 A seizure requires not only an

assertion of authority, as described above, but also submission to that authority.46 The law, thus,

makes clear that not every encounter between a police officer and a civilian falls within the scope

of the Fourth Amendment.47

        At its inception, a seizure pursuant to a Terry stop must be supported by an officer’s

“reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts that ‘criminal activity may be afoot.’”48

Although the “reasonable suspicion standard requires more than a visceral hunch about the

presence of illegal activity, it requires less than probable cause.”49 The First Circuit has found

that, “‘suspicious circumstances reported to the police by a reliable [known] person in a

nonconclusory fashion’ may in certain circumstances be sufficient to warrant a Terry stop.”50

Where an officer executes a stop in reliance on a tip, the tip must be, “reliable in its assertion of

illegality, not just in its tendency to identify a determinate person.”51

        A tip’s reliability is enhanced when it comes from an informant who is known to police

officers, and who has provided reliable information in the past.52 In light of the totality of the

circumstances, a “sufficiently specific tip from an informant of proven reliability can establish

probable cause for an arrest, not merely a Terry stop.”53 When a tip is corroborated by other

evidence, the combination lends greater support to an officer’s reasonable suspicion that criminal

activity is afoot.54 An informant’s credibility is also heightened when he is able to provide

information that indicates first-hand knowledge of the conduct that forms the substance of the

tip.55 At base, “[w]hile the source’s general credibility must be considered, all the law requires is

that, when all the pertinent considerations are weighted, the information reasonably appears to be

reliable.”56 In the reasonable suspicion analysis a tip, therefore, becomes one factor to be

considered by an officer in light of the entirety of the situation.

          A tip need not be given to the officer making the Terry stop himself in order to inform the

officer’s finding of reasonable suspicion. The First Circuit has emphasized that, “police may rely

          See, e.g., Monteiro, 447, U.S. at 47 (“there may be Terry-stop cases in which
corroboration comes in part from an individual’s gang affiliation and/or recent arrests for conduct
related to the activity referred to in a tip. Criminal history certainly can be considered in a
reasonable suspicion analysis.”); see also United States v. Bates, 750 F. Supp. 2d 342, 347 (D.
Mass. 2010) (“The question is ultimately whether the police had a reasonable suspicion that
criminal activity was afoot, and the touchstone of the analysis is whether ‘in light of all the
circumstances’ the ‘[tip] possessed sufficient indicia of reliability .’” (quoting United States v.
Ruidiaz, 529 F.3d 25, 31 (1st Cir. 2008)).

on information of other members of their force and respond accordingly.”57 Reasonable suspicion

can be imputed to the officer executing a search under the collective or pooled knowledge

principle if he “‘acts in accordance with the direction of another officer who has reasonable

suspicion.’”58 Accordingly, if the officer conducting the stop relies on information provided by a

fellow officer who lacks reasonable suspicion, “a stop in objective reliance upon [that information]

violates the Fourth Amendment.”59

          In sum, at the time a Terry stop occurs and a suspect is seized for purposes of the Fourth

Amendment, the officer conducting the stop must have a reasonable suspicion based on the

totality of the circumstances, that the suspect is engaged in criminal activity. Reasonable

suspicion may be based on all available information, including information received from fellow

officers, the seizing officer’s prior knowledge of the suspect, and the course of events leading up

to the stop itself.60

          After a lawful Terry stop, “a pat-frisk for weapons is also permissible where ‘the officer is

justified in believing that the person is armed and dangerous to the officer or others.’”61 As the

First Circuit recently enunciated:

                reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity
                may be afoot and that the persons with whom he is dealing may be
                armed and presently dangerous, where in the course of investigating
                this behavior he identifies himself as a policeman and makes
                reasonable inquiries, and where nothing in the initial stages of the
                encounter serves to dispel his reasonable fear for his own or others’
                safety, he is entitled for the protection of himself and others in the area
                to conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing of such
                persons in an attempt to discover weapons which might be used to
                assault him. Such a search is a reasonable search under the Fourth
                Amendment, and any weapons seized may properly be introduced in
                evidence against the person from whom they were taken.62

The Fourth Amendment analysis of a Terry stop and subsequent frisk, therefore, runs along a

continuum with the officer and the suspect’s conduct during the course of the stop being taken

into account in determining the propriety and scope of a search.

        B.      Application

        In the present matter, the encounter between the detectives, Teixeira and Defendant Shaw

began as a consensual encounter, escalated to a seizure, and culminated with the search of

Defendant that produced the gun and ammunition Defendant now seeks to suppress. In order to

assess the propriety of the search that lead to the discovery of the gun and ammunition, the court

must first consider when Defendant was “seized” for Fourth Amendment purposes, and whether

that seizure was supported by the detectives’ reasonable suspicion that Defendant was engaged in

criminal activity.

        The chain of events leading up to the search of Defendant Shaw began when Detective

Hilliard received a tip from a confidential informant. The informant was known to Detective

Hilliard and had provided reliable information on three prior occasions.63 The tip in this case,

because it came from a known, reliable informant, is similar to the one relied upon by the police in

Adams v. Williams.64 There, the Supreme Court found that an officer had a reasonable suspicion

to conduct a Terry stop where he received a tip from an informant who was known to him

personally and had given him information in the past.65 The fact that the tip to Detective Hilliard,

while not conveyed in person, did come from a known informant is significant because it indicates

that the informant could be held accountable by the police if he were to provide false

information.66

          The key factor in determining whether reasonable suspicion may be based on an

informant’s tip is whether, “when all the pertinent considerations are weighed, the information

reasonably appears to be reliable.”67 The informant who relayed the tip to Detective Hilliard was

able to provide first-hand information including a description of the suspects’ race, attire, and up

to date location. Each of these factors indicating first-hand knowledge enhances the informant’s

credibility.68 The tipper also relayed that the two men were carrying a gun, and that he knew this

because he had seen the two men with the gun. In relying on the information provided by the

confidential informant, Detective Hilliard, therefore, had a reliable basis to suspect that the

individuals identified by the tip were engaged in criminal activity, and was justified in contacting

the officers on duty and asking them to investigate.

       Police officers conducting a terry stop are entitled to rely on information provided by their

colleagues on the police force. As the Supreme Court has stated, “effective law enforcement

cannot be conducted unless police officers can act on directions and information transmitted by

one officer to another and that officers, who must often act quickly cannot be expected to cross-

examine their fellow officers about the foundation for the transmitted information.”69 Here, it was

reasonable for Detectives Almeida and Carde to rely on Detective Hilliard’s statements regarding

the tip he received from the confidential informant, and to proceed to investigate.

       When an officer relies in whole or in part on information provided by another member for

the force, “[u]nder the ‘collective knowledge’ or ‘pooled knowledge’ principle, ‘reasonable

suspicion can be imputed to the officer conducting a search if he acts in accordance with the

direction of another officer who has reasonable suspicion.’”70 Conversely, if the information is

given from one officer to another in the absence of reasonable suspicion, reliance upon it runs

afoul of the Fourth Amendment.71 Here, the tip given to Detective Hilliard had sufficient indicia

of reliability, as indicated above, to allow Detectives Almeida and Carde to reasonably rely on it in

proceeding to question the suspects.

       Reasonable suspicion based on an initial apparently reliable tip may be enhanced if officers

are able to confirm details provided by the informant upon reaching the suspects identified in the

tip.72   Here, Detectives Almeida and Carde relied on Detective Hilliard’s information from the

confidential informant in locating Teixeira and Defendant Shaw.73 They observed the suspects’

clothing and complexions to match those described by the confidential informant.74 They also

found the suspects in the precise location described to Detective Hilliard by the confidential

informant.75 The fact that these elements of the tip were corroborated by the detectives’

observations contributed to the reasonableness of Detective Almeida and Detective Carde’s

reliance on Detective Hilliard’s information.76

         Once they had located the suspects described by the confidential informant, Detectives

Almeida and Carde proceeded to investigate further before seizing the suspects. Detective

Almeida immediately recognized one of the men identified by the tip as Peter, ‘Hurt Neck,’

Teixeira, whom he knew to be a felon and ineligible to carry a firearm.77 At this point, rather than

start a Terry stop, Detective Almeida opted for a “soft approach.”78 He and Detective Carde,

not accurate because Defendant’s sweatshirt had prominent white stripes on it (Def.'s Mem. in
Supp. [#47] at 3-4), this argument is without merit because the consideration of whether a Terry
stop was valid requires an evaluation of the totality of the circumstances. In light of the numerous
details that were in agreement with the informant’s tip, the informant’s failure to mention the
stripes on Defendant’s sweatshirt does not defeat a finding of probable cause.

who were dressed in plain clothes, pulled their unmarked cruiser up next to the suspects and,

without activating the lights or sirens, exited the vehicle. As he exited the cruiser, Detective

Almeida asked to talk to Teixeira, and Teixera responded affirmatively.

       At this point, under the objective analysis, there was no Terry stop, and the suspects were

not seized for Fourth Amendment purposes. As this court has previously held, “Law

Enforcement officers do not violate the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition of unreasonable seizures

merely by approaching individuals on the street or in other public places and putting questions to

them if they are willing to listen.”79 None of the traditional factors used to assess the presence of

police coercion were present, and there was no objective indication that Shaw and Teixeira were

not free to disregard Detective Almeida’s request and leave the area.80 Such an encounter does

not trigger Fourth Amendment scrutiny until and “unless it loses its consensual nature.”81

       Events occurring after the start of the interaction between an officer and a suspect may be

taken into account in determining whether the officer had a reasonable suspicion that criminal

activity was afoot at the time the suspect was seized.82 Here, once the interaction between

Detective Almeida and Teixeira had begun, Teixeira moved his hands toward the pocket of his

          See Ford, F. Supp. 2d at 20 (“Factors that might elevate a police encounter from a
voluntary conversation to a seizure include the threatening presence of several officers, the display
of the officers’ weapons, any physical touching of the defendant, and the use of language or tone
of voice that indicates that compliance with the officers’ request is not discretionary.” (citing
Smith 423 F.3d at 29)).

alone.”) (citing United States v. Simmons, 560 F.3d 98, 106-07 (2d Cir. 2009).

sweatshirt, and Defendant Shaw “bladed” his body in a way that indicated to Detective Almeida

that Shaw was armed.83 As an encounter between law enforcement and a suspect progresses, “an

officer’s ‘subsequent actions must be responsive to the emerging tableau – the circumstances

originally warranting the stop, informed by what occurred, and what the officer learned as the

stop progressed.’”84

       The tip, the suspects’ location, Detective Almeida’s knowledge of Teixeira’s ineligibility

to possess a firearm, and the suspects’ movements once Detective Almeida approached combined

to provide a basis for Detective Almeida’s reasonable suspicion that Teixeira and Shaw were

engaged in criminal activity. The First Circuit has emphasized that, “even innocuous facts, which

taken alone may not be ‘sufficient to create reasonable suspicion [,] . . . may in combination with

other innocuous facts take on added significance.’”85 Other courts have found that furtive

gestures, such as a suspect moving his hands toward his pockets when police have reason to

believe he is armed, can form the basis of an officer’s reasonable suspicion necessary to effect a

Terry stop and subsequent pat-frisk.86 In light of the totality of the circumstances, and the

knowledge they possessed at the time, from both the tip and observations at the scene, the

detectives were justified in ordering Teixeira and Shaw to show their hands, and thus executing a

Terry stop by a show of authority, and the suspects’ subsequent acquiescence. Once Defendant

Shaw “bladed” his body and Teixeira moved his hands toward his pocket, the officers ordered

both men to show their hands. More officers then arrived, and all drew their service weapons. At

this point, there can be no doubt that Teixeira and Shaw were seized for the purposes of a Fourth

Amendment analysis.87

        The next question presented, therefore, is whether the pat-frisk of Defendant was

appropriate after the lawful Terry stop. “‘Officers are permitted to take actions to protect their

own safety and the safety of others in the area,’ including conducting a pat-frisk, if under all the

circumstances they have ‘a particularized and objective basis to suspect the individual ha[s] a

weapon.’”88 A protective pat-frisk is, therefore, permitted when, in light of the totality of the

circumstances after a lawful Terry stop, an officer has a specific reason to believe that the stopped

suspect is armed and dangerous.

        “[I]n determining whether a pat-down search is an appropriate step following a valid Terry

stop, the key is whether . . . ‘the officer is justified in believing that the person is armed and

dangerous to the officer or others.’”89 In this case, the content of the tip to Detective Hilliard had

indicated that Teixeiara and/or Shaw were armed. In their investigatory activities, “[t]he police

may rely on information of other members of their force and respond accordingly.”90 At the time

the stop commenced, as explained above, the officers had a reasonable suspicion to believe that

Teixeira and Shaw were engaged in criminal activity. When Detective Carde ordered the men to

show their hands, Shaw was slow to comply and continued to “blade” his body, a maneuver

Detective Almeida recognized as characteristic of someone carrying a firearm.91 The officers’

observations on the scene served to corroborate the tip relayed by Detective Hilliard, and gave the

officers a firm basis for believing that Defendant Shaw was armed and presently dangerous. The

pat-frisk of Defendant Shaw, therefore, was in compliance with the requirements of the Fourth

Amendment.

IV.    Conclusion

       Because the stop and the subsequent pat-frisk were did not violate the Fourth

Amendment, there is no basis for the exclusion of the gun and ammunition that were found on

Defendant Shaw. Accordingly, Defendant’s Motion to Suppress Evidence [#46] is hereby

DENIED.
