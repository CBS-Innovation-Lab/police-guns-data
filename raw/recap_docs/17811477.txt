                           MEMORANDUM & ORDER

GORTON, J.

       This case arises out of a stop, search and seizure that

took place in Watertown, Massachusetts in December, 2012.

Defendant Daryle Smith (“Smith” or “defendant”) moves 1) to

suppress the fruits of the search and seizure which he claims

violated his constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment,

2) to suppress statements he claims were obtained in violation

of his Fifth Amendment rights and 3) for an evidentiary hearing.

In light of precedent contrary to Smith’s claims and for the

reasons set forth below the Court will deny defendant’s motions

to suppress and for an evidentiary hearing.         The government’s

motion to strike the request for an evidentiary hearing will be

denied as moot.

  I.     Factual Background


       At approximately 9:00 P.M. on December 16, 2012, Adam

D’Agostino (D’Agostino) called 911, gave his name as Adam and

                                    -1-
     Case 1:13-cr-10064-NMG Document 61 Filed 11/13/13 Page 2 of 13



said someone in a car had waved a gun outside of his home in

Watertown.   D’Agostino described a black male passenger

brandishing a gun and a white female driving the car.

     A few minutes after the call, Watertown Police Officer

Robert Kelly (“Officer Kelly”) arrived on the scene and spoke to

residents of the house where the incident occurred: Kevin

Szydloski, Denis Delorey and Adam D’Agostino who explained that

the incident began with an altercation between Michael Morrisey,

who lived at the same address, and his ex-girlfriend, Elizabeth

Singleman.   All of these individuals will hereafter be referred

to by their surnames.    Singleman was attempting to recover money

from Morrissey but she was dissatisfied with the amount of money

she received from him.    As Singleman drove away, her passenger

allegedly waved a gun outside the passenger side window.

D’Agostino believed the male passenger was a man known as

“Clockmaster” who “ran” a housing project in Brighton.         Officer

Kelly left the premises and called the Boston Police, from which

he learned that “Clockmaster” was an alias for the defendant,

Daryle Smith.   A database search revealed that Smith had a

criminal record and was a felon.     Thus if the reports of Smith

brandishing a gun were true, he would be in violation of 18

U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), as a felon in possession of a firearm.

     Morrissey called 911 at approximately 4:00 A.M. and stated

that the man who had brandished the gun had returned.         The

                                  -2-

dispatcher told the responding officers to perform a felony stop

which would allow them to take additional safety precautions,

including turning on their cruisers’ flashing lights and

remaining in the car while using the loud-speaker system to

instruct suspects.

     Officer Brandon O’Neill (“Officer O’Neill”) arrived at the

scene in time to see a white woman and black man walking away

from a gas station trash container next to the house where the

first incident had occurred.     Officer O’Neill turned on his

cruiser’s flashing lights as the couple entered their car.

O’Neill used his loud-speaker system to instruct the couple to

move to the outside rear of the car.      They complied and Officer

O’Neill got out of his vehicle with his firearm drawn.         Sergeant

John McLellan (“Sergeant McLellan”) and Officer Catherine Welch

(“Officer Welch”) then arrived.

     Sergeant McLellan frisked Smith, found a bag of bullets in

his pants pocket and questioned him about the bullets, whether

he had a gun and, if so, where it was located.        Smith became

angry, loud and disruptive and began yelling about Morrissey’s

mistreatment of Singleman.    He also began waving his arms

despite having been instructed to keep them on the car.

Sergeant McLellan responded by placing Smith in handcuffs.

Officer Welch searched the car and the surrounding area and

found a gun under a trash container.

                                  -3-

     Smith and Singleman were arrested for possessing a firearm

without a permit.      Smith was read his Miranda rights but

nevertheless made several statements, including that the bullets

in his pocket were his, that he had a tattoo of the word

“Clockmaster” but not that he had waved a gun.           Smith then

refused to answer further questions about the gun.

  II.    Analysis


     Smith’s motion to suppress are premised on grounds that: 1)

his Fourth Amendment rights were violated when he was stopped

without probable cause and subjected to an unreasonable search

and seizure and 2) statements he made during the stop were

obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights.            He has

moved for an evidentiary hearing on his motion to suppress.

            A. Legal Standard


     Under the Fourth Amendment, individuals have the right to

be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.           That right is,

however, limited because law enforcement officers may approach

individuals without probable cause and investigate what they

perceive to be potential criminal activity. Terry v. Ohio, 392

U.S. 1, 24 (1968).      An officer need not have probable cause but

must have a “reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal

activity is afoot.” United States v. Romain, 393 F.3d 63, 71

(1st Cir. 2004).      This suspicion must stem from specific facts


                                     -4-
     Case 1:13-cr-10064-NMG Document 61 Filed 11/13/13 Page 5 of 13



and rational inferences. Terry, 392 U.S. at 21.        While

conducting a Terry stop, an officer is allowed to search for

weapons, ordinarily through a frisk. Id. at 24.

     Reasonable suspicion for a Terry stop may be established

through information supplied by informants that bears sufficient

indicia of reliability. Alabama v. White, 496 U.S. 325, 329

(1990).   Relevant indicia of reliable information include

whether the informant has been identified or can be identified.

Florida v. J.L., 529 U.S. 269 (2000).      Courts apply a two-prong

test to determine whether a Terry stop was reasonable, first

asking whether the initial stop was reasonable and then

assessing whether the officers’ actions during the stop were

reasonably related to the stop’s initial rationale.

           B. Application

                1. Fourth Amendment


     Smith contends that his seizure was a de facto arrest and

not a Terry stop. The government responds that the incident was

a valid Terry stop and frisk which did not violate Smith’s

Fourth Amendment rights.    The Court finds that the inception of

the stop falls within Terry parameters because the police

officers were operating under reasonable suspicion created by

interactions with reasonably reliable witnesses and because the

beginning of the stop was reasonably justified under the



                                  -5-
     Case 1:13-cr-10064-NMG Document 61 Filed 11/13/13 Page 6 of 13



circumstances.   Although initially reasonable, however, the

scope of the stop exceeded the Terry boundaries and ripened into

a de facto arrest.

                     i.    Reasonable Suspicion


     The responding police officers claim they were operating

under reasonable suspicion created by the two 911 calls and the

officers’ encounter with D’Agostino, Delorey and Szydlowski.

Such encounters with “informants” meet the reliability test

under the J.L. decision.    In the initial 911 call, D’Agostino

identified himself by his first name and his telephone number.

See, United States v. Andrade, 551 F.3d 103 (1st Cir. 2008).

Shortly thereafter, Officer Kelly went to D’Agostino’s residence

and spoke to D’Agostino, Szydlowski and Delorey.        They relayed

the same story D’Agostino told the 911 dispatcher about a fight

between Singleman and Morrissey and Smith brandishing a gun as

he and Singleman drove away.     Officer Kelly stated that he found

their testimony credible because they appeared to be scared of

Smith.   Based on those interactions and Officer Kelly’s own

assessment of the witnesses, the Court finds the informants

credible because they were willing to be identified and their

descriptions of Smith and Singleman were later corroborated.

                       ii.   Reasonable in its Inception


       Specific facts and rational inferences need to show that

the stop was justified at its inception. United States v.

Maguire, 359 F.3d 71, 76 (1st Cir. 2004).         The officers did have

specific facts at hand due to the credible tip and the

circumstances surrounding the incident. See, White, 496 U.S. at

329.    The tip revealed that the officers had reason to believe

the suspect in question was a felon and therefore, was not

permitted to carry the handgun he reportedly brandished.

       The circumstances surrounding the incident also render the

stop reasonable.     The time of night, location and the

reappearance of a couple meeting the general description

provided by D’Agostino, Szydlowski and Delorey and friends may

have led the officers to have more reason for caution.           It was

close to 4:00 A.M. at a location where someone had previously

reported a white woman with a black man who was waving a gun.             A

couple matching that description was then seen walking away from

the parking lot adjacent to the house where the incident had

occurred.    The presence of a couple suspected of having a gun

and the lateness of the hour were reasonable factors in the

officers’ decision to take extra precautions. See, United States

v. Pontoo, 666 F.3d 20, 28 (1st Cir. 2011).         Courts may draw

upon facts such as these and use them to assess the totality of



                                    -7-
     Case 1:13-cr-10064-NMG Document 61 Filed 11/13/13 Page 8 of 13



the circumstances and justify a stop at its inception. United

States v. Trullo, 809 F.2d 108, 111 (1st Cir. 1987).         Under the

circumstances, the officers acted reasonably when they stopped

Smith and Singleman.

                       iii. Scope of the Stop


     After determining that the stop was initially reasonable,

the inquiry turns to whether the officers’ actions were

reasonably related in scope to the justification for the stop.

If the scope was unreasonable, a Terry stop ripens into a de

facto arrest. Hayes v. Florida, 470 U.S. 811, 815 (1985).

Whether that occurs depends on a number of factors but the

degree of physical restraint placed upon the suspect is

dispositive. United States v. Trueber, 238 F.3d 79, 93-94 (1st

Cir. 2001).

     The threshold question for when a suspect is considered to

be under de facto arrest is whether a reasonable person in the

suspect’s position would have thought he was under police

custody in a position akin to a formal arrest and not simply

being questioned by police. Trueber, 238 F.3d at 93.         The

suspect must reasonably believe that he or she is not free to

leave. United States v. Mittel-Carey, 493 F.3d 36, 40 (1st Cir.

2007).   As a traditional element of an arrest, the use handcuffs

has a significant bearing upon the analysis of whether a



                                  -8-
     Case 1:13-cr-10064-NMG Document 61 Filed 11/13/13 Page 9 of 13



defendant reasonably feels free to leave.       United States v.

Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544, 554 (1980).      Terry stop boundaries

were exceeded when Smith was placed in handcuffs because a

reasonable person in his situation would not have felt free to

leave.   This Court concludes that the use of handcuffs at that

point exceeded the scope of a Terry stop and constituted a de

facto arrest.

                      iv.   Suppression


     Smith argues that because he was effectively under arrest

prior to being read his rights, all of the evidence obtained

from that night should be suppressed.      The Court agrees that the

stop was a de facto arrest but not that all of the evidence

subsequently obtained must be suppressed. See United States v.

Ryan, 729 F. Supp. 2d 479, 483 (D. Mass. 2010).        The bullets

were retrieved while the stop was within the boundaries set by

Terry before it ripened into an arrest. The bullets were

lawfully taken from defendant’s possession and will not be

suppressed as evidence. See, United States v. Am, 564 F.3d 25,

33 (1st Cir. 2009).

     Nor will the gun be suppressed because it is admissible

under Miranda’s public safety exception.       Situations in which a

suspect is in custody and a reported gun has not been found

generally fall under this exception. New York v. Quarles, 467



                                  -9-
     Case 1:13-cr-10064-NMG Document 61 Filed 11/13/13 Page 10 of 13



U.S. 649 (1984).    As in Quarles, the officers in the instant

case were faced with a suspect in custody and a gun that was

unaccounted for in a public space.        While it was unlikely that

someone would find the gun at 4:00 A.M., the officers would have

been derelict had they not searched for the gun after

discovering the bullets on Smith’s person.        Defendant’s argument

that the incident occurred too early in the morning to be a

threat to public safety ignores the fact that the arrest took

place in a public space where any number of people could have

found the gun within a few hours.        Once a suspect has been

validly stopped, frisked and found to possess ammunition, a

competent police officer will properly attempt to secure any

weapons in the area to avoid present and future harm. United

States v. Chan, 901 F. Supp. 480, 485 (D. Mass. 1995).         Finding

and securing the gun was a matter of public safety and will not

be suppressed.

                 2. Fifth Amendment


     Smith also seeks to suppress his statements made to the

police during the stop which he claims were obtained in

violation of his Fifth Amendment rights under Miranda. See,

United States v. Guerrier, 669 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2011).          The

public safety exception applies to all statements related to the

gun and the bullets, including any answers provided in response



                                  -10-
     Case 1:13-cr-10064-NMG Document 61 Filed 11/13/13 Page 11 of 13



to Officer McLellan’s questions on those matters.         United States

v. Shea, 150 F.3d 44, 48 (1st Cir. 1998) (holding that the

public safety exception applies to questions about weapons).

The rationale applicable to the weapon itself applies with equal

force to statements about the weapon.       See United States v.

Sophoan Oung, 490 F. Supp. 2d 21, 33 (D. Mass. 2007).         The

subject statements regarding the bullets and weapons were made

in response to valid questions that sought to secure a gun that

posed a potential threat to the public.

     Because the public safety exception applies to any and all

statements made with respect to the gun and ammunition, the

motion to suppress those statements will be denied.         Any

statement that Smith may have volunteered will not be suppressed

because they are not barred by the Fifth Amendment. See,

Miranda, 384 U.S. 436, 478 (1966). On the other hand, because

Smith was under de facto arrest and statements not relating to

the gun and ammunition do not fall within the public safety

exception, statements made before he was given his Miranda

warning will be suppressed. See, United States v. Arroyo, 2013

U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133399 at *18-19(D. Mass. Sept. 17, 2013)

                3. Evidentiary Hearing


     Smith moved for an evidentiary hearing in a perfunctory

fashion.   The decision to conduct an evidentiary hearing is



                                  -11-
     Case 1:13-cr-10064-NMG Document 61 Filed 11/13/13 Page 12 of 13



solely within the Court’s discretion. United States v. Calderon,

77 F.3d 6, 9 (1st Cir. 1996).     In order to obtain an evidentiary

hearing, a defendant needs to make a sufficient showing that a

warrantless search occurred by alleging specific and detailed

facts to support such a claim. United States v. Brown, 621 F.3d

48 (1st Cir. 2010) (internal citations omitted). A defendant’s

affidavit is not sufficient to make such a showing if it

contains only conclusory statements. United States v. Southard,

700 F.2d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 1983).      Finally, a defendant needs to

show that there are factual disputes that would entitle him to

relief if they were resolved in his favor. Id.

     Smith’s affidavit is entirely conclusory and simply states

that he did not feel free to leave.      More importantly, he has

not shown that there are any facts in dispute.        He relies on

police reports and other government-produced materials for his

submissions and motion.    While Smith claims those facts do not

justify the seizure, he does not dispute the facts themselves.

Accordingly, the motion for an evidentiary hearing will be

denied and the government’s motion to strike the defendant’s

request for an evidentiary hearing will be denied as moot.

                                 ORDER

     In accordance with the foregoing, defendant’s motion to

suppress (Docket No. 31) is, with respect to matters unrelated

to the handgun, bullets and statements concerning those objects,

ALLOWED, but in all other respects, DENIED.        The government’s

motion to strike defendant’s request for an evidentiary hearing

(Docket No. 43) is DENIED as moot.



So ordered.
