                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                       DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

             v.                              Case No. 06-cr-134-01/02-SM

Ellsworth Gottlieb and
Raymond Jackson

                                    ORDER

      Defendant Gottlieb’s motion to continue the final pretrial conference and

trial is granted (document 32).    Trial has been rescheduled for the May 2007

trial period. Defendant Gottlieb shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights not

later than March 1, 2007. On the filing of such waiver, his continuance shall be

effective.

      The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendants in a speedy trial, 18

U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would

unreasonably deny defendants the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances.

      Final Pretrial Conference: April 23, 2007 at 4:00 p.m.

      Jury Selection: May 1, 2007 at 9:30 a.m.
