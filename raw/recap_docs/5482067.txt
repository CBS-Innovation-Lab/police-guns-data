                  DEFENDANT’S SENTENCING MEMORANDUM

     Defendant, Michael Fowler, submits this memorandum to assist

the Court in sentencing.      For the reasons stated in defendant’s

objection to the offense level calculation in the Presentence

Report, an objection in which the government will join, defendant

submits that the Court should accept the parties stipulation that

the correct Total Offense Level is 27.         The Court should accept

the Probation Department’s conclusion that Fowler nominally falls

in Criminal History Category V; thus, his advisory guideline

sentencing range is 120-150 months with a statutory maximum

sentence under the statute of ten years.1         Defendant further

submits that a sentence of imprisonment of 100 months - modestly

lower than that suggested by the advisory guideline sentencing

range - more accurately takes into account his criminal history,

is consistent with the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a),



     1
      While it is technically possible for the Court to impose a
sentence that exceeds the statutory maximum by imposing
consecutive sentences, defendant submits that such a procedure
would be inappropriate here given that all of the offenses
alleged arose from the same course of conduct. Consequently, the
effective advisory sentencing range (assuming no variance) would
be the 120 months only.

and will result in a sentence that is sufficient, but not greater

than necessary, to effectuate the purposes of sentencing.

                                   ARGUMENT

A SENTENCE OF 100 MONTHS IMPRISONMENT IS SUFFICIENT BUT NOT
GREATER THAN NECESSARY AND MORE ACCURATELY TAKES INTO ACCOUNT
FOWLER’S CRIMINAL HISTORY AS WELL AS ALL OF THE FACTORS 18 U.S.C.
§ 3553(a).

     The Supreme Court has recently reaffirmed that, following

Booker, all Guideline Sentencing Ranges are merely advisory.

Kimbrough v. United States, 128 S.Ct. 558, 564 (2007).               Thus, a

sentencing court must include the Guidelines range as just one

piece in the array of factors warranting consideration and it is

free to determine that in a particular case a within Guidelines

sentence is “greater than necessary” to serve the objectives of

sentencing. Id. at 570 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)).                While 18

U.S.C. § 3553(a) requires a court to give “respectful

consideration” to the Guidelines, Booker and its progeny

“permit[] the court to tailor the sentence in light of other [§

3553(a)] concerns as well.”        Id.      The advisory guideline scheme

even permits sentencing courts to “vary [from Guidelines ranges]

based solely on policy considerations, including disagreements

with the Guidelines.”        Id.   Indeed, a sentencing court "may not

presume that the Guidelines range is reasonable" but instead

must, using the factors set forth in § 3553(a), "make an

individualized assessment based on the facts presented."                Gall v.

United States, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596 (2007).            Here, the now-familiar

§ 3553(a) factors dictate a sentence of 100 months, modestly

lower than the 120-150 months range suggested by the sentencing

guidelines.

     Even prior to Booker and its progeny, the courts recognized

that U.S.S.G. §4A1.3 expressly encourages a downward departure

where the criminal history classification "significantly over-

represents the seriousness of a defendant's criminal history or

the likelihood that the defendant will commit further crimes."

The First Circuit's decision in United States v. Rivera, 994 F.2d

942, 947 (1st Cir. 1993) broadly construed a district court's

authority to depart from the guidelines in cases that are outside

the "heartland" of the guidelines, especially where a specific

guideline provision "encourage[s]" grounds for departures.              Id.

at 948.   U.S.S.G. §4A1.3, with its emphasis on accurately

assessing criminal history, is such a provision.

     Here, the defendant's criminal history contains no crimes of

violence or drug offenses whatsoever.        His Criminal History

Category is propelled to Category V largely as the result of a

number of petty property offenses, such as larceny and

shoplifting, committed over a decade ago; indeed, only six of the

twelve points assigned to his criminal history score result from

incarceration for the two serious convictions for prior gun

offenses.   The rest of the points assigned are as the result of

ancient minor offenses of limited seriousness and of little use

in predicting recidivism, and because Fowler was on probation for

a limited duration at the time of the instant offenses.

     Defendant submits that these circumstances go to the heart

of the Supreme Court’s and the statute’s direction to consider

“the Nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and

characteristics of the offender.”           18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).       A

sentence of 100 months represents the low end of Criminal History

Category IV, the category just below that suggested by the

Probation Department.        Category IV - and the resulting low-end

sentence of 100 months - better captures the Sentencing

Commission’s attempt to incorporate the seriousness of a

defendant’s criminal history.        As the Supreme Court recently

noted:

     [I]n the ordinary case, the Commission's recommendation
     of a sentencing range will “reflect a rough
     approximation of sentences that might achieve §
     3553(a)'s objectives.” Rita [v. United States], 551
     U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct., [2456], 2465 [(2007)]. The
     sentencing judge, on the other hand, has “greater
     familiarity with ... the individual case and the
     individual defendant before him than the Commission or
     the appeals court.” Id. at ----, 127 S.Ct. at 2469. He
     is therefore “in a superior position to find facts and
     judge their import under § 3353(a)” in each particular
     case. Gall, ante, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 128 S.Ct. 586,
     2007 WL 4292116 (internal quotation marks omitted). In
     light of these discrete institutional strengths, a
     district court's decision to vary from the advisory
     Guidelines may attract greatest respect when the
     sentencing judge finds a particular case “outside the
     ‘heartland’ to which the Commission intends individual
     Guidelines to apply.” Rita, 551 U.S., at ___, 127 S.Ct.
     at 2465.

Kimbrough, 128 S.Ct. at 574 (emphasis supplied).                This is a case

where Fowler’s individual guideline, to the extent it is driven

by his criminal history, overstates the factor that the

Sentencing Commission intended to be weighed.            Consequently, this

Court can - and should - sentence him below the nominally

applicable range because such a sentence is “sufficient, but not

greater than necessary” to achieve the goals outlined in §

3553(a).

                                CONCLUSION

     For the foregoing reasons, this Court should impose a

sentence of 100 months imprisonment, a modest variance from that

suggested by the advisory guideline sentencing range, with a

three-year period of supervised release to follow.               The Court

should impose no fine.
