          ORDER ON MOTION FOR MODIFICATION OF RESTITUTION

         Before the Court is Defendant’s Motion for Modification of Restitution (Docket #
  117). Having reviewed all submissions in connection with the Motion, the Court hereby
  DENIES the Motion for Modification.
         Having reviewed the Defendant’s written submissions and given the Defendant’s
  continuing incarceration, the Court does not find any material change in the Defendant’s
  economic circumstances that affects the Defendant’s ability to pay restitution. Thus,
  there is no basis for a modification pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3664(k). To the extent that
  Defendant’s Motion can be read to argue that the Court’s April 3, 2003 Judgment (or the
  June 21, 2004 Amended Judgment) improperly delegated the schedule of restitution
  payments to the Bureau of Prisons, the Court believes that this argument is without merit
  and untimely. Finally, to the extent that Defendant’s Motion can be read to argue that the
  Bureau of Prisons is somehow not complying with the regulations that govern the Inmate
  Financial Responsibility Program, such a challenge must be brought as a habeas petition
  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 in the district in which the defendant is incarcerated.
         SO ORDERED.

                                                       /s/ George Z. Singal
                                                       Chief U.S. District Judge

  Dated this 18th day of September, 2008.
