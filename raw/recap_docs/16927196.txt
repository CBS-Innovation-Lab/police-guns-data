        Marla Billings claims a right to receive overdue child support from cash the Defendant

Larry N. Perkins forfeited to the Government. See Docket # 12. Because this Court cannot

foreclose the possibility Ms. Billings has an enforceable legal interest, it will allow her two

weeks to demonstrate the basis of her interest.                  Failing that, this Court will grant the

Government’s Motion to Dismiss Petition for Lack of Standing (Docket # 13).

I.      STATEMENT OF FACTS

        On April 11, 2005, the Defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of a three-count

Information (Docket # 1) and consented to a forfeiture in Count III. See Docket # 4. Count I

alleged possession with the intent to manufacture marijuana, and Count III claimed a forfeiture

of $25,000.00 as a substitute for property used to facilitate the crime and $1,250.00 seized from

the Defendant’s premises.1          On April 11, 2005, this Court issued a Preliminary Order of

Forfeiture (Docket # 5) and, after notice was published, on June 10, 2005, Ms. Billings filed a

pro se petition, representing that she and the Defendant share a child, but for the last three years,

he has failed to pay child support. Ms. Billings seeks reimbursement of this delinquent child

 Count II alleged possession of a firearm by a prohibited person, a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9); Count II is
not relevant to Ms. Billings’s petition.

support from the forfeited money. The Government objected and has moved to dismiss the

petition.

II.        DISCUSSION

           The authority to forfeit property in this case is found in 21 U.S.C. § 853. The statute

requires any property “used . . . to commit . . . or to facilitate the commission of” a federal drug

crime be forfeited to the United States. Id. § 853(a)(2). It also establishes a procedure to protect

the interests of third parties to the extent they have a “legal interest in [the] property which has

been ordered forfeited.” Id. § 853(n)(1), (2). To secure an order protecting that interest, the

petitioner must demonstrate she has:

                    [A] legal right, title, or interest in the property, and such right, title,
                    or interest renders the order of forfeiture invalid in whole or in part
                    because the right, title, or interest was vested in the petitioner
                    rather than the defendant or was superior to any right, title, or
                    interest of the defendant at the time of the commission of the acts
                    which gave rise to the forfeiture of the property under this section.

Id. § 853(n)(6). This provision is, in essence, a standing requirement. See United States v.

Padilla-Galarza, 351 F.3d 594, 600 (1st Cir. 2003). Unsecured general creditors do not usually

have standing to assert a legal interest superior to that of the Government. United States v.

Ribadeneira, 105 F.3d 833 (2d Cir. 1997); United States v. BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg) S.A.,

46 F.3d 1185 (D.C. Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 515 U.S. 1160 (1995); United States v. Campos, 859

F.2d 1233 (6th Cir. 1988).

           Ms. Billings’s petition failed to comply with the provisions of § 853(n)(3).2 The petition

is not under oath, and it fails to state the nature and extent of her interest in the property being



2
    21 U.S.C. § 853(n)(3) states:
                   The petition shall be signed by the petitioner under penalty of perjury and shall
                   set forth the nature and extent of the petitioner’s right, title, or interest in the
                   property, the time and circumstances of the petitioner’s acquisition of the right,


                                                             2
 Case 1:05-cr-00024-JAW Document 16 Filed 07/06/05 Page 3 of 4                                    PageID #: 48



forfeited. Other than a general reference to an ongoing child support obligation running back

three years, there is no statement as to the time and circumstances of Ms. Billings’s acquisition

of the interest. This Court cannot divine from the sparse allegations in the petition whether Ms.

Billings has an interest in the forfeited property superior to that of the Government.

       It is doubtful she does. Section 853(n)(6)

               protects only two classes of petitioners, those whose legal interests
               in the property were superior to the defendant[] at the time the
               interest of the United States vested through the commission of an
               act giving rise to forfeiture and “bona fide purchasers for value”
               without knowledge of the forfeitability of the defendant’s assets.

United States v. Kennedy, 201 F.3d 1324, 1328-29 (11th Cir. 2000) (quoting United States v.

Reckmeyer, 836 F.3d 200, 204 (4th Cir. 1987)); see also United States v. Jimerson, 5 F.3d 1453,

1455 (11th Cir. 1993). There is no indication here that Ms. Billings could be considered a bona

fide purchaser for value.

       The question is whether she had an interest superior to that of the Government at the time

the Defendant committed the crime. To have such an interest, Ms. Billings would have to

establish more than a general interest in the Defendant’s property, but rather a legal interest “in a

particular, specific asset, as opposed to a general interest in an entire forfeited estate or account.”

Ribadeneira, 105 F.3d at 836. Typically, standing alone, a child support obligation is not

sufficient to create a legal interest in a particular, specific asset. United States v. Dempsey, 55 F.

Supp. 2d 990, 993-94 (E.D. Mo. 1998); United States v. 127 Shares of Stock in Paradigm Mfg.,

Inc., 758 F. Supp. 581, 583 (E.D. Cal. 1990); see also United States v. Carrell, 252 F.3d 1193,

1196 n.2, 1207 n.15 (11th Cir. 2001). Here, although the Government claimed the right to forfeit

land owned by Larry and Dorothy Perkins, it allowed him to substitute $25,000.00 in place of


               title, or interest in the property, any additional facts supporting the petitioner’s
               claim, and the relief sought.

this land. Specifically, there is no indication the child support obligation had matured into an

enforceable legal interest either in his land or cash, but it is not beyond the realm of possibility. 3

Maine law provides for a variety of mechanisms to enforce a support order, some of which could

have created a security interest in this cash. See 19-A M.R.S.A. § 2603; but see Ribadeneira,

105 F.3d at 836 (quoting United States v. Ribadeneira, 920 F. Supp. 553, 555 (S.D.N.Y. 1996)

(“Dollars are fungible. As holders of checks, as opposed to security interests, petitioners are

unable to assert rights to a particular asset or specific funds.”)).

        Rather than dismiss the petition outright, this Court will grant Ms. Billings two weeks to

file an amended petition complying with the terms of the statute and facially demonstrating the

basis of her legal interest either in the Defendant’s land or in the $25,000.00 at issue. If she fails

to do so, the Government’s Motion to Dismiss Petition for Lack of Standing will be granted and

Ms. Billings’s petition will be dismissed.

        SO ORDERED.

Dated this 6th day of July, 2005




3
  It is difficult to conceive of any legally cognizable interest Ms. Billings could claim in the remaining $1,250.00
seized from the Defendant’s premises, since the Defendant has admitted he obtained this part of the forfeited money
“directly or indirectly as a result of the violation alleged in Court One of this Information.” Information at 2.
