and N-18. A hearing was held before Magistrate-Judge Marcos E. López in which the tapes

and matching transcripts were examined. Subsequently, the Magistrate-Judge recommended:

        (b)   the request for suppression of N-14 is deemed Moot, inasmuch as the objections

              to the same were withdrawn by defendant(s)

        (c)   the suppression of tapes at N-9, N-10, N-13, N-15 and N-18 be denied
