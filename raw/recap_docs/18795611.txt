                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                       DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

             v.                              Case No. 06-cr-154-01-SM

Timothy Seeley

                                    ORDER

      Defendant Seeley’s motion to continue the final pretrial conference and

trial is granted (document 7). Trial has been rescheduled for the February

2007 trial period. Defendant Seeley shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights not

later than November 2, 2006. On the filing of such waiver, his continuance

shall be effective.

      The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18

U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would

unreasonably deny defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances.

      Final Pretrial Conference: January 23, 2007 at 2:30 p.m.

      Jury Selection: February 6, 2007 at 9:30 a.m.
