                             UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                               DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND


UNITED STATES OF AMERICA                          :

         v.                                       :          C.A. No. 06-107S

                               MEMORANDUM AND ORDER


       In this matter, Defendant Isaac Chandler filed his pro se Motion to Vacate Sentence on

January 27, 2010. (Document No. 47). Defendant submitted an Application to Proceed without Full

Prepayment of Fees and Affidavit on March 22, 2010. (Document No. 53). The matter of

Defendant’s Application to Proceed without Full Prepayment of Fees has been referred to me for

determination. 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A); LR CV 72(a).

       Although 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a) authorizes a district court to permit the “commencement,

prosecution or defense of any suit, action or proceedings, civil or criminal...without prepayment of

fees...” there is no fee required to file a 28 U.S.C. § 2255 Motion such as Defendant’s Motion to

Vacate. See Rules Governing § 2255 Proceedings, R. 3, Adv. Comm. 1976 Adoption. Nevertheless,

the Advisory Committee Notes indicate that a Motion to Proceed IFP should be considered, and

granted where appropriate, as it permits “a streamlining of the process to allow quicker disposition

of these motions.” Id.

       In this case, Defendant’s completed Application is out of date. Defendant obtained a

certification from a prison official as to his inmate account, but he did not attach a copy of “all

receipts, expenditures, and balances during the last six months in [his] institutional accounts.” In

order to determine his eligibility, Defendant must complete and file an updated Application To
Case 1:06-cr-00107-M-LDA Document 54 Filed 03/25/10 Page 2 of 2 PageID #: 208



Proceed Without Prepayment of Fees and Affidavit. The Application contains a “Notice to

Prisoner” portion which directs an incarcerated applicant to obtain a statement certified by an

“appropriate institutional officer” of “all receipts, expenditures, and balances during the last six

months in your institutional accounts.”

       The Clerk is directed to provide Defendant with a copy of the current Application. If

Defendant wishes to pursue his Application, he shall return the completed Application to the Court

by April 23, 2010.

So ordered.

                                                             PER ORDER:
