                      DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

           v.                           Criminal No. 09-cr-03-1/3-JL

Christian German et al


                                O R D E R


     The assented to motion to reschedule jury trial (document no.

29) filed by defendant is granted. Continuance is limited to 45

days.

     Defendant shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights within 10

days.   The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting

a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), for the

reasons set forth in the motion.

     SO ORDERED.
