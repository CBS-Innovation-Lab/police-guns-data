ORDER ON DEFENDANT’S MOTION IN LIMINE TO EXCLUDE BAD ACTS
                       EVIDENCE

      Facing trial next week, Levell Matthews moves in limine to exclude evidence

of bad acts under Rule 404(b). Def. Levell Matthews’ Mot. to Exclude Bad Acts Evid.

(ECF No. 97).    Specifically, he does not want the Government’s witness, Renee

Weeks, to say that he is a “known drug dealer” since she has only “assumed” this

assertion and has no direct evidence that her characterization is true. Id. at 1-2.

Furthermore, even if she could establish a basis for her characterization, Mr.

Matthews still objects because the evidence would serve “only to prove bad

character and is unfairly prejudicial.”     Id. at 2. More generally, Mr. Matthews

objects to her testifying that he “otherwise deals drugs.” Id. at 3.

      To the “known drug dealer” concern, the Government responds that it has “no

intention of seeking testimony in those words from Ms. Weeks on direct

examination in its case-in-chief.” Gov’t’s Resp. to Def.’s Mot. in Limine to Exclude

Bad Acts Evid. at 1 (ECF No. 100). The Government notes, however, that Ms.

Weeks is expected to testify that “she was promised crack cocaine in return for

helping Defendant and the other male conspirator at Frati’s Pawn Shop.” Id. It

contends that this evidence is “part of the conspiracy and should not be excluded.”

Id. Furthermore, the Government observes that “it is possible that Defendant’s

cross-examination of Ms. Weeks could elicit just such testimony in the form of a

truthful response to a question.” Id. The Government urges the Court to await

developments at trial before finally ruling on the admissibility of Ms. Weeks’

statement. Id. at 1-2.

      Based on the parties’ agreement, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in

part the Defendant Levell Matthews’ Motion to Exclude Bad Acts Evidence (ECF

No. 97). The Court GRANTS the motion to the extent it seeks an Order prohibiting

Renee Weeks, the Government’s witness, from testifying on direct examination

during the Government’s case-in-chief that Mr. Matthews was a “known drug

dealer.” The Court otherwise DENIES the motion since the admissibility of the

testimony must await trial developments. The Court allows Ms. Weeks to explain

that she agreed to purchase firearms in exchange for a promise of crack cocaine.

      SO ORDERED.
