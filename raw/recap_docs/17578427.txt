                    UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                  FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND


UNITED STATES OF AMERICA                   :
                                           :
     v.                                    :              CR 09-125 S

CRISTOFER ABREU-QUERO                      :




                            REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION

David L. Martin, United States Magistrate Judge

     Before    the    Court     is   the   Application          to   Proceed   without

Prepayment of Fees and Affidavit (Docket (“Dkt.”) #13) (“IFP

Application”)        filed      by     Defendant          Cristofer      Abreu-Quero

(“Defendant”).       Because I conclude that the IFP Application should

be   denied,    it     is     addressed        by   way    of    this    Report    and

Recommendation.       See Lister v. Dep’t of Treasury, 408 F.3d 1309,

1312 (10th Cir. 2005)(explaining that because denial of a motion to

proceed in forma pauperis is the functional equivalent of an

involuntary dismissal, a magistrate judge should issue a report and

recommendation for a final decision by the district court).

                                     Discussion

     The IFP Application is not connected to any pleading or

petition. It was filed with a Transcript Order (Dkt. #12) by which

Defendant seeks a transcript of his sentencing.                       See Transcript

Order.    However, Defendant is not entitled to a free transcript

because he has not given any specific facts to show that he has
some meritorious claim to present via a petition pursuant to 28

U.S.C. § 2255.   See United States v. Desouza, No. 93-1205, 1993 WL

299394, at *2 (1st Cir. Aug. 5, 1993)(concluding district court

acted properly in denying defendant’s motion for free transcripts);

id. at *1 (“Because [defendant], who is seeking collateral relief,

has not even described in general terms what the nature of her

claim is, let alone given any specific facts to show that she has

some meritorious claim, it is clear that the district court acted

properly in denying her request for a free transcript.”); see also

United States v. MacCollom, 426 U.S. 317, 325, 96 S.Ct. 2086 (1976)

(holding that right to free transcript is not necessary concomitant

of writ of habeas corpus and noting that “[t]he district court has

the power to order a free transcript furnished if it finds that the

‘suit ... is not frivolous and the transcript is needed to decide

the issue presented ....’”)(quoting 28 U.S.C. § 753(f)).

     Accordingly, Defendant’s IFP Application should be denied

without prejudice to being renewed if Defendant provides specific

facts showing that he has some meritorious claim to present via a

petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.   I so recommend.

                            Conclusion

     Accordingly, for the reason stated above, I recommend that

Defendant’s IFP Application be denied without prejudice.       Any

objections to this Report and Recommendation must be specific and

must be filed with the Clerk of Court within fourteen (14) days of


                                 2
its receipt.   See Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b); DRI LR Cv 72(d).   Failure

to file specific objections in a timely manner constitutes waiver

of the right to review by the district court and of the right to

appeal the district court’s decision.       See   United States v.

Valencia-Copete, 792 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1986); Park Motor Mart,

Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 616 F.2d 603, 605 (1st Cir. 1980).
