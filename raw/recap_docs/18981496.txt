                    UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                         DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America,
      Plaintiff

               v.
                                             Case No. 11-cr-82-01-SM

Timothy Pieper,
     Defendant

                                     ORDER


      Defendant Pieper’s motion to continue the final pretrial conference and

trial is granted (document no. 8). Trial has been rescheduled for the October

2011 trial period. Defendant Pieper shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights not

later than July 28, 2011. On filing of such waiver, his continuance shall be

effective.

      The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendants in a speedy trial,

18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would

unreasonably deny the defendants the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances.
