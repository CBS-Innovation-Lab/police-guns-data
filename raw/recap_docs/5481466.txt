TRANSCRIPT REDACTION POLICY - AMENDED MAY 5, 2008


                                                   INTRODUCTION
       The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts shall make transcripts of
court proceedings, filed on and after May 5, 2008, available through its electronic case files
(CM/ECF) system.

        The primary purpose of the Transcript Redaction Policy is to provide guidance to the Court’s
Official Court Reporters and the attorneys of this bar when preparing and reviewing transcripts of
official court proceedings to be filed with the Court.

                                                     AUTHORITY

       At its September 2007 session, the Judicial Conference approved a new policy regarding the
availability of transcripts of court proceedings.

       In addition, amendments to the Federal Civil and Criminal Rules of Procedure implementing
requirements of the E-Government Act of 2002 to protect the privacy and security of publicly
available electronic filings took effect on December 1, 2007. The amendments to Rule 5.2 of
FRCvP and Rule 49.1 of FRCrP require that personal identification information (social security
numbers, names of minor children, financial account numbers, dates of birth, and, in criminal cases,
home addresses) be redacted from documents filed with the Court.

                                              POLICY DESCRIPTION

          The effective date of this Policy is May 5, 2008.

       It applies only to transcripts of proceedings held before a Judicial Officer of this Court, not
depositions taken outside of court or proceedings of state courts or other jurisdictions.

       It establishes a procedure for counsel to request the redaction from the transcript of specific
personal data identifiers before the transcript is made electronically available to the general public.

        It does not change any rules or policies with respect to sealing or redaction of court records
for any other purpose.

TRANSCRIPT REDACTION POLICY - AMENDED MAY 5, 2008

        It does not affect or limit the right of any party (or any other person or entity) to order
production of a transcript on an expedited basis. This policy does not affect any court rules or ruling
requiring the sealing of materials or the protection of sealed materials.

        There is no obligation on the part of the Office of the Clerk to perform any redaction. It is
the responsibility of counsel to advise the court reporter what to redact, and the responsibility of the
court reporter to perform the redaction.

       Redaction responsibilities apply to counsel, even if the requestor of the transcript is a judge
or a member of the public or media.

        Unless otherwise ordered by the Court, counsel shall review the following portions of the
transcript:

          •         opening and closing statements made on the party’s behalf;
          •         statements of the party;
          •         the testimony of any witnesses called by the party; and
          •         any other portion of the transcript as ordered by the Court.

                                                    PROCEDURES

Notice of Intent to Redact

        Within seven (7) business days of the filing of an official court transcript, each party wishing
to redact a transcript shall inform the Court by filing (via CM/ECF) with the Clerk’s Office a
“Notice of Intent to Redact .” A sample form is available on the Court’s website and is attached to
this policy.

Redaction Request

        If a redaction is requested, unless the Court shall otherwise order, counsel shall file (via
CM/ECF) with the Clerk’s Office, a “Redaction Request” within twenty one (21) days from the
filing of the transcript, indicating where the personal identifiers appear in the transcript by page and
line, and how they are to be redacted. A sample form is available on the Court’s website and is
attached to this policy.

TRANSCRIPT REDACTION POLICY - AMENDED MAY 5, 2008

          This procedure is limited to the redaction of the specific personal data identifiers listed
below:

          •         Social security numbers to the last four digits;
          •         Financial account numbers to the last four digits;
          •         Dates of birth to the year;
          •         Names of minor children to the initials; and
          •         Home addresses to the city and state.

       If counsel files a “Notice of Intent to Redact,” but later determines that no redaction is
necessary, counsel shall file a “Withdrawal of Notice of Intent To Redact.”

        If counsel fails to timely file a Redaction Request or Motion to Extend Time or a Withdrawal
of the Intent to Redact, the Office of the Clerk shall issue an Order to Show Cause requiring the
attorney to file the redaction request, a notice of withdrawal of the intent to redact, or show cause
why the transcript should not be released to the public after ninety (90) calendar days from the date
the original transcript was filed.

Additional Copies of Transcript Purchased

        The court reporter shall notify the court reporter supervisor if additional copies of the
transcript are purchased by other counsel of record. The court reporter supervisor will provide
electronic access for those additional attorneys during the ninety (90) day period.

Redacted Transcript

        If a redaction is requested, the court reporter shall file the redacted transcript with the Office
of the Clerk within thirty one (31) days after the filing of the original transcript. The title page of
the redacted transcript shall indicate that it is a redacted transcript by including “REDACTED
TRANSCRIPT” immediately below the case caption and before the volume number and the name
and title of the Judge.

TRANSCRIPT REDACTION POLICY - AMENDED MAY 5, 2008

Sealed and Partially Sealed Transcripts

       If a transcript is to be filed under seal, the court reporter shall submit that transcript clearly
labeled as “SEALED.” The court reporter supervisor shall electronically file the PDF document
with the appropriate restrictive setting.

       If only a portion of a transcript has been ordered sealed, the court reporter shall extract the
sealed portions from the original transcript as a separate PDF document (clearly labeled as
“SEALED”). The remaining public portion of the transcript shall be created and both PDF
documents, clearly labeled, submitted to the court reporter supervisor for electronic filing.

        Counsel shall review the remaining public portion of the transcript for any necessary
redactions.

Requests for Additional Redactions

        Further redactions require the filing of a “Motion for Redaction of Electronic Transcript.”
Until the Court has ruled on any such motion, the transcript shall not be electronically available,
even though the ninety (90) day restriction period may have expired.

Remote Public Access to Transcripts

        If the original transcript is filed without redaction, that original transcript shall be remotely
electronically available through PACER after ninety (90) calendar days.

        If a redacted transcript is filed with the Court, that redacted transcript shall be remotely
electronically available through PACER ninety (90) calendar days from the date of filing of the
original transcript. The original transcript shall not be made publicly available.

CJA Panel Attorneys

        An attorney who is serving as appointed “standby” counsel for a pro se litigant must review
the transcript as if the pro se party were his/her client. If an attorney represents a client pursuant to
the Criminal Justice Act (CJA), including serving as standby counsel, the attorney conducting the
review of the transcript is entitled to compensation under the CJA for functions reasonably

performed to fulfill that obligation, and for reimbursement of reasonable expenses related to the
transcript review.

PACER Fees

        PACER fees shall be applied both during and after the ninety (90) day restriction period.
Charges shall accrue for all pages of the transcript. The user shall incur PACER charges each time
the transcript is accessed even though he/she may have purchased it from the court reporter and
obtained remote access through CM/ECF. Unlike other documents filed electronically, there is no
‘free look’ for transcripts.
