v.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Respondent.

 

AMENDED DECISION AND ORDER
JOHN J. MCCONNELL, JR., United States District Judge.

Before the Court are three motions filed by Isaac Nathaniel Chandler. They are: a motion
to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (ECF No. 47), two motions to add
supplemental claims (ECF Nos. 61, 68), and a motion for discovery (ECF No. 60). For the
reasons that folloW, these motions are denied.

1. BACKGROUND AND TRAVEL1

On May 4, 2006, Providence police detectives executed a search Warrant for Mr.
Chandler and his two residences in Providence. On his person, the officers found $205 in cash,
jewelry and 6.7 grams of crack cocaine. They found an additional 34.13 grams of crack cocaine,
cutting and packaging materials, along With a loaded .45 caliber pistol, home theater equipment
and a safe containing $2,500 in cash at his residences. Officers also seized a 1994 Lexus vehicle.
After being advised of his rights, Mr. Chandler admitted that the crack cocaine and the firearm

belonged to him and that he sold cocaine and kept the firearm for protection.

 

1 A more complete discussion of Mr. Chandler’s arrest, plea and sentencing proceedings are set out in
detail in the decision affirming his conviction and sentence, see United States v. Chandler, 534 F.3d 45
(1st Cir. 2008). For purposes of the instant motions, this Court recites only those facts pertinent to Mr.
Chandler’s § 2255 claims.

In October 2006, Mr. Chandler was charged in a three-count Federal indictment with: (1)
possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine base within 1,000 feet of a
public school, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B) and 860; (2) possession with
intent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and
841(b)(1)(B); and (3) being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §
922(g)(1). During all pertinent proceedings pertaining to his plea and sentencing, Mr. Chandler
was represented by court-appointed counsel.

Pursuant to a plea agreement, Mr. Chandler pled guilty to all three counts.2 In that
agreement Mr. Chandler agreed, inter alia, (1) that he possessed 40.91 grams of cocaine base in
the form of crack cocaine, (2) that the items named in the indictment were subject to forfeiture
“as proceeds of illegal conduct, property facilitating illegal conduct, property involved in illegal
conduct and substitute assets for property otherwise subject to forfeiture,” and (3) that a two-
level enhancement for possession of a firearm would apply to his sentence. Plea Agreement at
1111 1, 4, Jan. 5, 2007. Mr. Chandler also agreed to waive his right to file a direct appeal if the
sentence imposed Was within “the guideline range determined by the Court or lower.” Id. at ‘|l
12.

The Government, for its part, agreed to recommend “a term of imprisonment at the
lowest point of the guideline range for the offense level determined by the Court under the
United States Sentencing Guidelines or 97 months imprisonment, whichever term was greater.
Id. at 11 2.a. (emphasis added.) The Government also agreed (1) not to file an information under

21 U.S.C. § 851, (2) not to prosecute Mr. Chandler under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) for possession of a

 

2 All plea and sentencing proceedings were conducted before Judge Ernest C. Torres of this Court.
After the appeal concluded, the matter was transferred to Judge William E. Smith and, in May 2011, it
was further transferred to the undersigned

firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking; and (3) to recommend a 2-3 level reduction in his
offense level for acceptance of responsibility. Id. at ‘|l‘ll 2.b; 2.c.; 2.e.; 2.f.

At his change of plea hearing, Mr. Chandler acknowledged that he understood the terms
of the plea agreement, including the terms governing the Government’s recommendation and the
restrictions thereon. See Tr. of Change of Plea Hr’ g 10, Jan. 5, 2007. The Court informed Mr.
Chandler that it was not bound by the recommendations in the plea agreement, that it would
determine the applicable sentencing guideline range, and Mr. Chandler indicated his
understanding Id. at 11-12.

The United States Probation Office prepared a Presentence Report (PSR), calculating a
guideline range of 210 to 262 months based on a total offense level of 32 and a Criminal History
Category VI. In accordance with the plea agreement, the Govemment did not file a sentencing
enhancement information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 851, Which would have increased the
mandatory minimum for Mr. Chandler’s drug offenses to ten years with a maximum of life, nor
did the Government charge Mr. Chandler with a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), which would
have added a mandatory five-year term of imprisonment consecutive to the sentence imposed.

At sentencing, the Government’s attorney, in accordance with the plea agreement,
recommended a prison sentence of 210 months, the low end of the guideline range calculated by
the PSR. Tr. of Sentencing 28, Mar. 23, 2007. Defense counsel argued for both a downward
departure and a variant sentence. Upon hearing argument, the Court granted a “horizontal”
departure and lowered Mr. Chandler’s Criminal History Category from VI to V, which yielded a

guideline range of 188 - 235 months.3 After considering the factors under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a),

 

3 At the sentencing hearing Judge Torres noted: “The real question here is the argmment about the over-
representation of the criminal history. And I think [defense counsel] has made a good argument here, that
as she points out, but for the fact that Mr. Chandler is classified as a career offender, he would have a
criminal history category of 4 . . . but for the fact that he’s been classified as a career offender, his
guideline range Would be 188-235 months But because he’s been classified as a career offender, it’s
210-262 months So it’s made a significant difference in the guideline range.” Id. at 35-36.

3

the Court imposed concurrent sentences of 188 months imprisonment as to Counts l and lI and
120 months imprisonment as to Count III. Id. at 40-41.

Mr. Chandler appealed, represented by new counsel. On July 18, 2008, the First Circuit
Court of Appeals dismissed his appeal, finding that Mr. Chandler’s arguments Were barred by the
waiver-of-appeal provision in his plea agreement and that his ineffective assistance claims were
premature. See United States v. Chandler, 534 F.3d 45, 49-51 (1st Cir. 2008).

Mr. Chandler then filed the instant 28 U.S.C. § 2255 motion to vacate. In his motion he
claims: (1) that the Govemment breached its obligations in the plea agreement, (2) that he was
ineffectively assisted by his counsel at sentencing, and (3) that he was ineffectiver assisted by
his counsel on appeal. Mr. Chandler subsequently filed two separate pleadings, seeking to
supplemental his motion to vacate. The first was filed on July 2, 2010 and claims that two of the
detectives who arrested him falsified information in order to obtain the warrants used to search
his residences, and the second, filed on October 1, 2010, asserts that the fact that state court
warrants were used as the basis of Mr. Chandler’s federal prosecution violated federal procedure
and his due process rights. Additionally, Mr. Chandler filed a motion for discovery in
connection with his first supplemental pleading. These three motions before the Court are ready
for decision.4

II. MOTION TO VACATE

 

4 Although Mr. Chandler has requested an evidentiary hearing, no hearing is required in connection

with any issues raised by this motion to vacate or supplemental pleadings, because, as discussed infra, the
files and records of this case conclusively establish that his claims are without merit. See David v. United
States, 134 F.3d 470, 477 (lst Cir. 1998) (district court properly may forego any hearing “when (l) the
motion is inadequate on its face, or (2) the movant's allegations, even if true, do not entitle him to relief,
or (3) the movant's allegations need not be accepted as true because they state conclusions instead of
facts, contradict the record, or are inherently incredible.”) (internal quotations omitted).

The grounds justifying relief under § 2255 are limited.5 A court may grant such relief
only if it finds a lack of jurisdiction, constitutional error, or a fundamental error of law. See
United States v. Addonizio, 442 U.S. 178, 184-185 (1979) (“An error of law does not provide a
basis for collateral attack unless the claimed error constituted a fundamental defect which
inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice.”) (intemal quotations omitted).

Moreover, a motion under § 2255 is not a substitute for a direct appeal. See United States
v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 165 (1982). A movant is procedurally precluded from obtaining § 2255
review of claims not raised on direct appeal absent a showing of both “cause” for the default and
“actual prejudice” -- or, alternatively, that he is “actually innocen ” of the offense for which he
was convicted. Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 622 (1998); see also Brache v. United
States, 165 F.3d 99, 102 (1st Cir. 1999). Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, however,
are not subject to this procedural hurdle as the failure to bring those claims “on direct appeal is
not subject to the cause and prejudice standard.” Knight v. United States, 37 F.3d 769, 774 (1st
Cir. 1994).

A. Timeliness of Motion to Vacate

As a threshold matter, the Government argues that Mr. Chandler’s original § 2255 motion
was untimely because the motion was docketed after the filing deadline. See U.S. Br. 4-5, ECF
No. 49. On October 13, 2009, just days before the expiration of the one-year limitations period,
Mr. Chandler mailed his initial § 2255 motion to the “United States District Court for the District
of Rhode Island, 50 Kennedy Plaza, Providence, Rhode Island 02903,” which is the street

address of the United States Attorney’s Office. The motion Was received on October 19, 2009.

 

5 Title 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (a) provides in pertinent part:

A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming the right to be
released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the
United States, or that the court was Without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence is in
excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may move the court
which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.

On January 10, 2010, Mr. Chandler mailed a letter to the U.S. District Court stating that the
motion was mailed to the incorrect address because he did not have access to an updated court
address. The Court docketed Mr. Chandler’s motion to vacate on January 27, 2010, over three
months after the deadline.

The Government asserts that the motion should be considered as filed on January 27,
2010 and that Mr. Chandler should not receive the benefit of the so-called prisoner mailbox rule.
Morales-Rivera v. United States, 184 F.3d 109, 109 (1st Cir. 1999). Mr. Chandler counters that
the prisoner mailbox rule should apply, excusing his mailing error, because he is a pro se litigant
inexperienced in these formalities who was assisted in addressing the envelope by a law clerk at
his prison facility. See Pet’r’s Reply to Government’s Resp. to Mot. to Vacate 3-7, ECF No. 51.6
He further contends that even if he was negligent in addressing the envelope, the prosecutor’s
office was equally negligent for receiving and signing for mail intended for this Court rather than
promptly returning the mailing to Mr. Chandler, permitting him an opportunity to timely re-file.
Id.

Generally, a number of courts considering whether pro se inmate papers mailed to an
incorrect address may invoke the mailbox rule have given pro se prisoners the benefit of the
doubt. See e.g. Mayne v. Hall, 122 F.Supp.2d 86 (D. Mass. 2000) (§ 2254 petition mailed to
court at court’s former street address deemed timely filed under mailbox rule); Hollins v. United
States, 2005 WL 1827914 (E.D. Mo. Aug. 2, 2005) (deeming § 2255 petition to be timely filed,
where petitioner promptly re-mailed his incorrectly addressed petition upon its return).

However, courts have also noted that strict compliance and diligence is required to obtain the

 

6 Mr. Chandler asserts that David Price Bomboy, a law clerk at FCI Ray Brook, assisted him by
addressing the envelope on Mr. Chandler’s behalf, using a return address on an envelope from the Court
because there was no address book for the federal courts in the prison library inventory. Mr. Chandler has
submitted an Affidavit from Mr. Bomboy, who avers that, at the time the motion was filed, he had no
access to either computer or paper resources listing an updated address for this Court.

benefits of that rule. See Thompson v. Raspberry, 993 F.2d 513, 515 (5th Cir. 1993) (mailbox
rule does not relieve a prisoner of responsibility of doing all that is reasonably possible to ensure
that documents are received by court in a timely manner, including properly addressing outgoing
mail); Solis-Caceres v. United States, No. 8:09-CV-539-T-27TGW, 2010 WL 2731280
(M.D.Fla. July 9, 2010) (finding incorrectly addressed § 2255 motion to be untimely due to
prisoner’s failure to use prison’s legal mailing system, as required by § 2255 Rule 3(d)).

The precise issue in this case -the applicability of the mailbox rule to a pro se inmate’s
incorrectly addressed § 2255 petition has not been squarely decided by the First Circuit.7 See
Morales-Rivera, 184 F.3d at lll, n.4 (after finding mailbox rule applicable to inmate’s filing of
§ 2255 motion to vacate, court noted that the government was free to argue on remand that
inmate had negligently addressed his motion). Other courts that have addressed this issue are
split. Compare, e.g., United States v. Diaz, No. Civ.A. 95-5610, 1999 WL 391384 (E.D. Pa.
May 27, 1999) (finding motion for reconsideration mistakenly sent to U.S. Attorney’s office to
be timely filed, where petitioner received a return receipt acknowledging delivery), with Daniels
v. United States, No. 3105-CV-768, 2006 WL 2433462 (N.D. Ind. Aug. 18, 2006) (§ 2255
petition filed three months after expiration of 1-year limitations period deemed untimely, even
though petitioner had previously mailed a timely § 2255 petition, but misdirected it to U.S.
Attorney’s office).

The circumstances of this case favor application of the mailbox rule. In light of Mr.

Chandler’s good faith reliance on the prison facility law clerk’s assistance to prepare and file

 

7 Pursuant to the mailbox rule, “a pro se prisoner’s motion is [deemed] filed on the date that it is

deposited in the prison’s internal mail-system for forwarding to the district court, provided that the
prisoner utilizes, if available, the prison’s system f`or recording legal mail.” Morales~Rivera v. United
States, 184 F.3d 109, 109 (lst Cir. 1999). The court noted that the rule, first set forth in Houston v. Lack,
487 U.S. 266 (1988), applies to inmate petitions filed under both 28 U.S.C. §§ 2254 and 2255. Id. at 111.
See also Rule 3(d) of the Rules Governing § 2255 Proceedings for the United States District Courts (“A
paper filed by an inmate confined in an institution is timely if deposited in the institution’s internal
mailing system [for legal mail] on or before the last day for filing.”).

legal paper and his correspondence with the Court when he realized his addressing error, the
Court finds that Mr. Chandler’s motion to vacate was timely filed. See Diaz, 1999 WL 391384,
at *1-2; Mayne v. Hall, 122 F.Supp.2d 86, 95-96 (D. Mass. 2000).

B. Alleged Breach of Plea A,qreement

Moving on to the substance of Mr. Chandler’s arguments advocating that his conviction
and sentence be vacated, Mr. Chandler first claims that the Government breached the plea
agreement because it characterized him as a career offender at sentencing, causing the Court to
impose a more severe sentence than contemplated in the agreement. He seeks “specific
performance” by the Government of il 2.a. of the agreement, which he contends contemplates a
97 -month sentence. Pet’r’s Br. 3, ECF No. 47.

The Court finds that the Government did not breach its obligations under the plea
agreement. The provision in question states that:

a. The government will recommend that the Court impose a term of

imprisonment at the lowest point of the guideline range for the offense level

determined by the Court under the United States Sentencing Guidelines . . . or 97

months imprisonment, whichever term is greater . . . If however, Defendant seeks

a downward departure under the guidelines or advocates for a sentence below the

guideline range, the government will then be free to recommend any term of

imprisonment within the applicable guideline range found by the Court.
Plea Agreement, il 2.a. (emphasis added).

The Government recommended the lowest sentence within the applicable guideline
range, i.e. 210 - 216 months imprisonment, as promised. The fact that this recommendation was
greater than the 97 month alternative mentioned in the plea agreement does not indicate
nonperformance because the agreement specifically provided that the government would
recommend the larger of the two possible sentence ranges. Moreover, the Government never
agreed “to oppose whatever upward adjustments the probation office might recommend or the

district court might opt to impose.” United States v. Vazquez-Ortiz, 201 F.3d 429 at *1 (1st Cir.

1999) (Table). The prosecutor’s reference at sentencing to Mr. Chandler’s status as a career

8

offender, as discussed in the PSR, likewise does not constitute a breach of the plea agreement.
Furthermore, Mr. Chandler specifically agreed at his plea hearing “that the court Was not bound
by the parties’ stipulations of fact, offense level adjustments, or the government’s
recommendations” and that “even if the Court’s guideline determinations and sentence [were]
different than [Mr. Chandler] expect[ed], [he would] not be allowed to withdraw [his] plea of
guilty.” See United States v. Chandler, 534 F.3d 45, 47 (1st Cir. 2008). 8 Finally, the
Government performed the other obligations under the plea agreement, including refraining from
filing a § 851 information and additional gun charges. Thus, Mr. Chandler’s invocation of
“contract principles” does not assist him, as this Court has found no breach -- contractual or
otherwise -- by the Government of its obligations under the plea agreement.

Mr. Chandler’s reliance on United States v. Riggs, 287 F.3d 221 (1st Cir. 2002) in
support of his claim is misplaced Pet’r’s Br. 3-5, 7-8, ECF No. 47. In Riggs, the Government
failed to recommend a sentence based on a drug quantity of 5 to 50 grams of crack cocaine, as
promised in the plea agreement, and instead recommended a sentence based on 480 grams of
crack cocaine, causing Riggs to be sentenced based on the higher drug quantity. Id. 287 F.3d at
224-25. The court noted that neither the prosecutor nor defense counsel even mentioned the
pertinent provision of the plea agreement at sentencing, id. at 224, n.4, and vacated Riggs’
sentence. Id. at 226. Unlike the situation in Riggs, the record in this case demonstrates that the

Government, defense counsel and the Court were all aware of the provision in question.9 By

 

9 Indeed, defense counsel acknowledged that the 97-month sentencing option was not available given
the applicable guideline range of 210-262 months. See Tr. of Sentencing Hr’g 23, Apr. 24, 2007.
Moreover, Judge Torres questioned the prosecutor at length as to whether, absent Mr. Chandler’s second
offense triggering his career offender status, 97 months would be reasonable and challenged the
Government’s assumption that an applicable sentencing guideline range was always reasonable. Id. at 29-
35. At most, while the Government’s position may have been “somewhat troubling” to the Court, there
was no error in the proceedings, as the Court was entitled to rely upon the applicable guideline range,
which it separately found to be correctly calculated. See Rivera-Rodriguez, 489 F.3d at 57-58 (finding no
breach where prosecutor recommended sentence as provided in plea agreement, but made reference to

9

contrast, the Government in this case agreed to recommend the lowest point of the applicable
guideline range or 97 months, whichever was greater, and its recommendation was in line with
that agreement. United States v. Rivera-Rodriguez, 489 F.3d 48, 57 (lst Cir. 2007). Therefore,
in light of the facts at issue and the applicable case law, the Court finds that Mr. Chandler’s
claim that the Government’s breach of the plea agreement justifies the vacation of his conviction
and sentence is without merit.

C. Ineffective Assistance Claims

“To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show not
only that ‘counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the ‘counsel’
guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment,’ but also that the deficient performance
prejudiced the defense and deprived the defendant of a fair trial.” U.S. v. Manon, 608 F.3d 126,
131 (1st Cir. 2010); Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984).

To satisfy the reasonable performance prong, the defendant “‘must identify the acts or
omissions of counsel that are alleged not to have been the result of reasonable professional
judgment,’ and the court then determines whether, in the particular context, the identified
conduct or inaction Was ‘outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.”’
Manon, 608 F.3d at 131 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690). The prejudice prong requires the
defendant to “show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional
errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” Id. (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at
695). “A reasonable probability is one ‘sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.”’ Id.

1. Sentencing Counsel
Mr. Chandler contends that his trial counsel was deficient for failing to argue that the

Court had authority under United States v. Rivers, 50 F.3d 1126, 1131 (2d Cir. 1995), and related

 

quantities of drugs other than those mentioned in plea agreement and to seeking a higher offense level had
case gone to trial).

10

case law, to grant a vertical departure, thereby reducing his offense level. Although the Court
did grant a horizontal departure reducing his criminal history category, Mr. Chandler argues that
the Court Was not aware of its authority under the guidelines, and as such, Mr. Chandler was
deprived of an opportunity for a lower sentence. Pet’r’s Br. 10-13, ECF No. 47.

Mr. Chandler’s argument fails because the argument he insists his counsel should have
made to the Court misstates the law as it existed at the time of his sentencing in 2007. The 2003
amendments to the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines changed the permissible departures in sentencing
for drug offenses such as the ones Mr. Chandler pled to, superseding Rivers. See USSG, App. C,
Amendment 651; United States v. Grier, 585 F.3d 138, 142-143 (3d Cir. 2009) (recognizing that
the 2003 amendments to USSG § 4A1.3 precluded vertical departures for overrepresentation of
criminal history). See also United States v. Pierre, No. 07-003S, 2011 WL 3360116, at *2-*3
(D.R.I. 2011) (rejecting an identical claim).10 Theref`ore, Mr. Chandler’s counsel cannot be
deemed ineffective for failing to argue invalid law. See Vieux v. Pepe, 184 F.3d 59, 64 (1st Cir.
1999) (counsel not required to assert frivolous or futile motions or arguments).

As for the second part of the Strickland test, Mr. Chandler was not prejudiced by any
alleged mistake by counsel because there is no evidence that the Court would have imposed a
lesser sentence. The Court, although free to Vary from the guideline range after ruling on Mr.
Chandler’s motion for a downward departure, decided that the appropriate sentence, in light of
all of the factors under 18 U.S.C. § 3553, was a sentence of 188 months imprisonment Thus,

even if the Court had authority to award a further departure, it is unlikely that it would have done

 

w The cases Mr. Chandler cites in support of his motion - see e.g. United States v. Lacy, 99 F.Supp.2d
108 (D. Mass. 2000); United States v. Eugene Terrell Patrick, No. 96-10047 (D. Mass. Feb. 26, 1999) --
likewise predated the 2003 amendment to USSG § 4A1.3 and thus do not assist him.

11

so, in light of the Court’S refusal to vary from the guideline range,11 It follows that Mr. Chandler
cannot demonstrate prejudice.
2. Appellate Counsel

Mr. Chandler next claims that his counsel on appeal was ineffective in failing to
challenge the appeal waiver provision based on the Government’s alleged breach of the plea
agreement, rather than on an alleged miscarriage of justice due to the conversion of currency
seized for purposed of calculating drug quantity. Pet’r’s Br. 14-17, ECF No. 47.

This claim requires little discussion. Applying the Strickland two part test, the Court
finds that Mr. Chandler’s appellate counsel’s performance did not fall “below an objective
standard of reasonableness.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984). As discussed
supra, the Government did not breach the plea agreement, and thus it would have been fruitless
for counsel to make that argument on appeal. It is well settled that counsel’s performance is “not
deficient if he declined to pursue a filtile tactic.” Vieux, 184 F.3d at 64; see also United States v.
Wright, 573 F.2d 681, 684 (1st Cir. 1978) (“Counsel is not required to waste the court’s time
with futile or frivolous motions.”). Moreover, appellate counsel could reasonably have
concluded that an argument based on an alleged miscarriage of justice would be stronger than
one based on a non-existent prosecutorial breach of plea agreement. See Smith v. Robbins, 528
U.S. 259, 288 (2000) (“Appellate counsel . . . need not (and should not) raise every nonfrivolous
claim, but rather may select from among them in order to maximize the likelihood of success on
appeal.”). Accordingly, Mr. Chandler’s ineffective assistance claim regarding his appellate

counsel fails.

 

11 This is especially true in a case such as here, where Mr. Chandler’s criminal history category was
determined by his career offender status, but his offense level was the result of the application of USSG §
2D1.1, which yielded a higher offense level than the career offender provision. Given that Mr.
Chandler’s status as a career offender only affected his criminal history category and not his offense level,
there is no reason to think that the Court would have departed vertically even if it had been able to do so.

12

In light of this Court’S oonclusions, after considering Mr. Chandler’s arguments
supporting his motion to vacate and the applicable case law and statutes, that motion is denied.
III. MOTIONS TO “SUPPLEMENT” CLAIMS

Mr. Chandler has filed two motions for leave to file “supplementa ” claims, each of
which seeks to assert additional claims in connection with the instant motion to vacate. The first
motion raises a claim of misconduct by two Providence Police detectives who participated in the
Mr. Chandler’s investigation and arrest. Pet’r’s Mot. to Supp. Pleadings 2, ECF No. 61. Mr.
Chandler’s second motion similarly asserts that the detectives improperly obtained warrants from
state court rather than federal court prior to arresting him and searching his residences, in
violation of Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and Mr. Chandler’s due process
rights. Pet’r’s Mot. to Supp. Pleadings 2-6, ECF No. 68. The Government has opposed both
motions. The Court finds that both motions to supplement must be denied, as each of the
proposed claims fails for both procedural and substantive reasons.

As a threshold matter, the Government argues that Mr. Chandler’s new claims should be
characterized as proposed amended pleadings, rather than supplemental pleadings, because the
factual occurrences asserted in those claims occurred prior to the filing of his initial § 2255
motion. See United States v. Hicks, 283 F.3d 380, 385 (D.C.Cir. 2002) (unlike amendments,
which are based on matters that transpired prior to the filing of the original pleading,
supplemental pleadings set forth “‘transactions, occurrences, or events that have happened since
the date of the pleading sought to be supplemented.”’) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(d)). However, a
pleading generally does not become a supplement merely because it references facts that
occurred subsequent to the original complaint. Rather, the appropriate bases for supplemental

pleadings are “new facts bearing on the relationship between the parties.” Id. at 386 (citing 6A

13

Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure §
1504 at 177-83 (3d ed. 2010)).12

Here, although Mr. Chandler’s new claims may have been motivated by events that
occurred subsequent to the filing of his motion to vacate (i.e., the indictments of the two
detectives), the new claims are actually based on events that happened at the time of his arrest
(i.e., the alleged improprieties of the detectives in obtaining search and arrest warrants), well
before the filing of the instant motion to vacate. As such, this Court will treat the proposed
claims as amended, not supplemental pleadings. The filing of amended pleadings is governed by
well-established rules and principles, which this Court will now apply to each of Mr. Chandler’s
proposed clairns.

A. First Amended Pleading

Mr. Chandler’s first amended claim asserts that the actions of certain Providence Police
detectives leading to his arrest and conviction for drug and gun offenses were “tainted by
corruption,” in view of the subsequent arrest and indictment of those detectives for drug-related
crimes.13 Specifically, Mr. Chandler asserts that the two detectives “falsified all sworn
documents presented to judicial authorities to obtain search and arrest warrants [and then]

utilized [the] subsequently obtained search and arrest warrants to convict” Mr. Chandler.14 He

 

12 This Court is aware that “[t]he distinction between an amended pleading and a supplemental pleading
is often disregarded for purposes of relation back under Rule lS(c).” FDIC v. Knostman, 966 F.2d 1133,
1138 (7th Cir. 1992); 6A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure
§1504 at 184 (2d ed. 1990). Here, however, the distinction is important, given Mr. Chandler’s efforts to
characterize his new claims as “supplemental pleadings.”

13 The named Detectives are Joseph Colanduono and Robert Enright. Mr. Chandler was arrested on
May 4, 2006; Colanduono and Enright were indicted in March 2010, nearly four years later. The Court
takes judicial notice that the charges against Enright were subsequently dismissed; the record is silent as
to the status of the charges against Colanduono.

14 ln his first amended claim Mr. Chandler also alleged that the detectives planted evidence against
him. Pet’r’s Mot. to Supp. Pleadings 2, ECF No. 61. However, he subsequently retreated from these
allegations, stating in his reply to the Government’s objection that he “did not actually declare that the
drugs were per se ‘planted’ on him in this case ...” and that while his supplemental pleading “did word

14

further asserts that the use of the evidence obtained through those search warrants against him
constituted Brady violations. See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963); see Pet’r’s Mot. to
Supp. Pleadings 2-3, ECF No. 61. This claim is both procedurally barred and substantively devoid
of merit.

A federal prisoner’s efforts to amend his § 2255 motion are governed by Fed. R. Civ. P.
15. See United States v. Ciampi, 419 F.3d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 2005). Under Rule 15, an untimely
pleading amendment to a § 2255 habeas motion may only be allowed if the amendments “relate
back” to the timely filed original pleading -- i.e., “the claim asserted in the amended plea ‘arose
out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original
pleading.”’ Id. (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(2)). “[I]n the habeas corpus context, the Rule 15
‘relation back’ provision is strictly construed, in light of ‘Congress’ decision to expedite
collateral attacks by placing stringent time restrictions on [them].”’ Id. (quoting Mayle v. Felix,
545 U.S. 644, 657 (2005)). “Accordingly, amended habeas corpus claims generally must arise
from the ‘same core facts,’ and not depend upon events which are separate both in time and type
from the events upon which the original claims depended.” Id. at 24.

Here, the allegations in Mr. Chandler’s first supplemental pleading - that two of the
arresting officers planted evidence and falsified affidavits in order to obtain search warrants
against Mr. Chandler -- involve facts that differ substantially from the allegations in his original
motion to vacate, where he alleged that the Government breached the plea agreement and
ineffective assistance at sentencing and on appeal. Because the facts asserted in the first

amended claim involve a completely different set of facts from those on which the original

 

the issue as the officers having planted ‘evidence,’ the true meaning [he] was trying to present was that
the officers planted drugs in th[eir own] investigations which . . . [were the subject of] their personal
charges,” and “not so much that the officers planted the specific drugs in this case.” Pet’r’s Traverse
(Reply) to Gov’t’s Objection 1, 4, ECF No. 64 (spelling corrections made). Thus, this Court need not
address this allegation.

15

claims depended, the new claim does not arise from “the same conduct, transaction, or
occurrence” as that set forth in his original § 2255 claims. As such, the claim does not relate
back, is untimely and may not be asserted here, See Ciampi, 419 F.3d at 24; United States v.
Thinh Cao, No. 05-134 ML, 2011 WL 4055413, at *9 (D.R.I. Sept. 12, 2011) (rejecting proposed
amended claim as untirnely).

Even if the amended claim were appropriate, Mr. Chandler’s challenge to the search
warrants used against him would fail. First, it is well settled tha “a defendant who
unconditionally pleads guilty waives all ‘independent claims relating to the deprivation of
constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea.”’ United States v.
Ga]jcney, 469 F.3d 211, 214 (1st Cir. 2006) (unconditional guilty plea effectively waives all
independent claims of alleged violations of constitutional rights that occurred prior to entry of
guilty plea) (quoting Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 267 (1973)); see United States v.
Valdez-Santana, 279 F.3d 143, 145 (1st Cir. 2002) (same); United States v. Cordero, 42 F.3d
697, 699 (1st Cir. 1994) (same, barring Fourth Amendment suppression claim). Here, Mr.
Chandler’s guilty plea was voluntarily made, and thus his Fourth Amendment claims based on
the insufficiency of the search and arrests warrants are precluded.

Moreover, even if this claim were to be considered on its merits, it falls well short of
stating any claim warranting relief. Mr. Chandler merely avers some connection between his
case and the indictments of the two state detectives nearly four years later, but provides no
factual basis for that connection. Further, the motion and supporting papers are devoid of any
facts that would draw into question the validity of the investigation leading to Mr. Chandler’s
conviction and sentence. Thus, adding the proposed new claim would be an exercise in futility.

See Muskat v. United States, 554 F.3d 183, 195-96 (lst Cir. 2009) (“The law is settled that

16

futility is a sufficient basis for denying leave to file an amended complaint.”) (citing Foman v.
Davis, 371 U.s. 178, 182 (1962)).15

B. Second Arnended Pleading

This Court’s analysis with respect to Mr. Chandler’s second amended claim yields a
similar result. Mr. Chandler asserts that the fact that the warrants used to support his federal
prosecution were obtained from the Rhode Island state court rather than this Court violated Fed.
R. Crim. P. 41 and his due process rights. 16 Because the facts asserted in this claim are distinct
from the facts on which his original claims are based, the second new claim does not arise from
“the same conduct, transaction, or occurrence” as that set forth in his original § 2255 motion to
vacate. As such, this claim is likewise procedurally barred as untimely under Rule 15. See
United States v. Ciampi, 419 F.3d 20, 24 (lst Cir. 2005); Thinh Cao, 2011 WL 4055413 at *9.

Even if this amended claim were appropriately made, Mr. Chandler’s challenge to the
search warrants used against him would fail on several grounds. First, as stated previously, Mr.
Chandler’s voluntary plea of guilty precludes his constitutional claims based on the insufficiency
of the search and arrests warrants. See Gaj_‘fney, 469 F.3d at 215 ; Tollett, 411 U.S. at 267.

Second, this amended claim is likewise meritless because it has long been recognized that
a federal prosecution may properly result from an investigation based on a state court search
warrant. See United States v. Soule, 908 F.2d 1032, 1038 (1st Cir. 1990) (upholding search

warrant obtained from state court judge by federal agent in state-federal investigation); United

 

15 As the First Circuit’s affirmance confirms, there was more than sufficient evidence to uphold Mr.

Chandler’s conviction. Mr. Chandler admitted to police, after being informed of his rights that he did
possess the crack and the firearm, that he sold crack, and that he kept the firearm for protection. United
States v. Chandler, 534 F.3d 45, 47 (lst Cir. 2008). There were other officers involved in his arrest
besides Detectives Colanduono and Enright. Id. Moreover, Mr. Chandler admitted his guilt on all counts
in the plea agreement and in open court at his change of plea hearing. Id. at 48.

16 Mr. Chandler states that the two Providence police officers at issue “were completely dishonest in
their prepar[ation] of the affidavits at issue, in that this was a fully federal case, yet the officers who
obtained the Warrants, did so by application to a Rhode Island state court judge, when a federal judge or
magistrate was fully available to them.” Pet’r’s Mot. to Supp. Pleadings 2, ECF No. 68.

17

States v. Mitro, 880 F.2d 1480, 1484-85 (1st Cir. 1989) (same); United States v. Krawiec, 627
F.2d 577, 581-82 (1st Cir. 1980) (upholding search warrants issued by state judge based on
federal information in state-federal investigation). Moreover, as in Soule, the circumstances here
“allow no room for an inference that the cooperating law enforcement officials, whether state or
federal, acted other than in the interests of furthering the efficient investigation and prosecution
of violations of state and federal law as warranted by the fruits of their investigation.” Soule,
908 F.2d 10 at 1038. Therefore, the fact that the local police officers were working with a DEA
Task force does not affect the legality of the warrant or arrest here.

Finally, Mr. Chandler’s reliance on this Court’s ruling `on his motion for return of
property is misplaced. T his Court ruled that Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g) was inapplicable in this case
because the seizure and custody of any property was pursuant to a state search warrant. See Text
Order, July 7, 2011. This ruling did not address the underlying legality of the search warrants in
the first instance. 17

In light of these considerations, Mr. Chandler’s second amended claim cannot stand.
Apart from his allegations that the officers submitted false affidavits -- which allegations have
been found baseless -- Mr. Chandler does not raise any fact demonstrating that the search
warrants were deficient under either federal or state standards. Thus, the use of the warrants in
Mr. Chandler’s subsequent federal prosecution was proper and his motion to supplement his

motion to vacate is denied.18 Consequently, and in light of this Court’s determinations on Mr.

 

17 This Court is aware that its ruling affirming the Magistrate Judge’s Memorandum and Order has
been appealed to the First Circuit. This has no impact on this Court’s rulings herein.

18 Mr. Chandler has made additional arguments relating to the Providence Police detectives’ conduct.
To the extent Mr. Chandler’s thinly pled Brady claim Warrants any consideration, it fails because he does
not show that the Government withheld any exculpatory evidence during his prosecution, whether due to
any actions of the two detectives or otherwise. Additionally, Mr. Chandler’s claim that the dishonesty of
the Detectives in obtaining the warrants was so violative of due process that it rendered this Court without
jurisdiction is frivolous and rejected without discussion. See United States v. Lussier, 929 F.2d 25, 27
(lst Cir. 1991) (18 U.S.C. § 3231 indisputably gives the district courts subject matter jurisdiction over all
offenses against the laws of the United States.”’); Prou v. United States, 199 F.3d 37, 45 (1st Cir. 1999).

18

Chandler’s proposed amended claims, his requests for appointment of counsel and for an
evidentiary hearing in connection with those claims are denied.
IV. MOTION FOR DISCOVERY

In light of this Court’s decisions denying Mr. Chandler’s motion to vacate and his two
motions to supplement, his motion for discovery is denied as moot.
V. CONCLUSION

For the reasons set forth above, Mr. Chandler’s motion to vacate is hereby DENIED. In
addition, both motions for leave to file supplemental pleadings and his motion for discovery are

likewise DENIED.
