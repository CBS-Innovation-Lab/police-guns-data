                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

                         DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                   Criminal No. 05-cr-142-01-SM

Donald McMullin


                 ORDER FOR PSYCHIATRIC OR PSYCHOLOGICAL
                EXAMINATION PURSUANT TO 18 U.S.C. ยง 4244


     The court is of the opinion that there is reasonable cause

to believe that the defendant may presently be suffering from a

mental disease or defect for the treatment of which he is in need

of custody for care or treatment in a suitable facility.

Accordingly, the court hereby orders that a psychiatric or

psychological examination of the defendant be conducted and a

report filed with the court pursuant to 18 U.S.C. ยง 4244(b).

NOTE:   The court specifically seeks an opinion by the examiner

relative to the danger, if any, defendant may pose to himself or

others, given his demonstrated failure to comply with state

issued protective orders, as well as an opinion by the examiner

concerning sentencing alternatives that could best afford the

defendant the kind of treatment, if any, that he needs.

     Sentencing shall be scheduled after receipt by the court of

the report.
