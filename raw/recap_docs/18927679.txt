                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 09-cr-172-PB

Celestino Nieves-Vasquez


                                  O R D E R

     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

trial scheduled for January 5, 2010, citing the need for

additional time to negotiate a plea agreement or prepare for

trial.    The government does not object to a continuance of the

trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reason and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from January 5, 2010 to March 2, 2010.                In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
