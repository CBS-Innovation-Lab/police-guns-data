     ORDER AFFIRMING THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE’S RECOMMENDED
                          DECISION

      A petitioner serving a seventy-seven-month term of imprisonment for drug

conspiracy and conspiracy to violate federal firearms law brings a habeas corpus

petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 challenging the Bureau of Prison’s calculation

of his good time deductions. The Court affirms the Magistrate Judge’s recommended

decision and dismisses the petitioner’s motion without prejudice because the

petitioner has not exhausted his administrative remedies and because the Court does

not have authority over the calculation of good time deductions.

I.    BACKGROUND

      On February 26, 2019, Rashaad McKinney pleaded guilty to one count of drug

conspiracy in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(c), 846 and one count of

conspiracy to violate federal firearms laws in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 922(a)(5),

(a)(6), 924(a)(1)(A). Min. Entry (ECF No. 128); Indictment (ECF No. 2). On February

18, 2020, the Court sentenced Mr. McKinney to seventy-seven months on the drug

conspiracy charge and sixty months on the firearms charge, to be served concurrently;
Case 1:18-cr-00084-JAW Document 410 Filed 06/06/22 Page 2 of 7         PageID #: 1561




three years of supervised release on both counts, also to be served concurrently; and

a special assessment of $200. Min. Entry (ECF No. 260); J. (ECF No. 264).

      On May 3, 2022, Mr. McKinney filed a habeas corpus petition pursuant to 28

U.S.C. § 2241 challenging the calculation of his good time deductions. Mot. for

Habeas Relief Under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 (ECF No. 408) (Pet’r’s Mot.). Mr. McKinney

writes that he “wish[es] to challenge the way [his] sentence is being carried out”

because he “[has] not received any good time credits per [the] First Step Act.” Id. at

1, 3. He elaborates that “[he is] eligible and [his] recidivism level is a medium” and

that “[t]he law states that medium and high recidivism [inmates] receive[] 10 days

[of good time deduction] for every month of participation in evidence based programs.”

Id. at 1. Mr. McKinney notes that “[d]uring the last 23 months [he] ha[s] completed

a[] minimum of 12 programs which all fall under the First Step Act” and he is “also

enrolled in residential drug abuse treatment and the Threshold program.” Id. at 2.

      On May 5, 2022, the Magistrate Judge issued a Recommended Decision

recommending that the Court dismiss the petition without prejudice or transfer the

matter to the district with jurisdiction.      Recommended Decision on Pet. for

Postconviction Relief (ECF No. 409) (Recommended Decision). The Magistrate Judge

explained that “[a]fter a court imposes a sentence, the Bureau of Prisons is

responsible for the calculation of the sentence” and the application of any good time

credit. Id. at 1 (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3624(a)-(b); Gonzalez v. United States, 959 F.2d

211, 212 (11th Cir. 1992)). While a petitioner is free to “challenge the calculation

through a § 2241 motion,” id. at 2, such “petitions challenging the execution of a




                                          2
Case 1:18-cr-00084-JAW Document 410 Filed 06/06/22 Page 3 of 7            PageID #: 1562




federal sentence generally must be filed in the district of confinement.” Id. (quoting

Massaquoi v. Thomas, 545 F. App’x 118, 119 n.1 (3d Cir. 2013)). The Magistrate

Judge concluded that “[a]lthough Petitioner was sentenced in the District of Maine,

Petitioner does not appear to have been in custody within the District of Maine when

he filed the petition.” Id. As a result, the Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal

of the petition without prejudice or “transfer [of] the matter to a court in the district

of custody.” Id.

      Mr. McKinney did not object to the Magistrate Judge’s Recommended Decision.

II.   DISCUSSION

      The Court reviewed the Magistrate Judge’s Recommended Decision and

concurs with the recommendations of the Magistrate Judge for the reasons set forth

in that decision and as further elaborated here. The Court views the Recommended

Decision as substantively correct, and the Court adopts and affirms the decision in

its entirety. In addition to the Recommended Decision, to avoid another deficient

petition and to explain why the Court is dismissing Mr. McKinney’s petition as

opposed to transferring it to the Middle District of Pennsylvania, the Court writes to

inform Mr. McKinney of the requirement that he exhaust administrative remedies

with the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) before he file a new petition to pursue a challenge

to the BOP’s good time deduction calculation.

      The Court first notes that Mr. McKinney is not challenging his sentence, as

imposed by this Court. Although a habeas corpus petition is the proper way for a

federal inmate to challenge the execution of his sentence, the Magistrate Judge is




                                           3
Case 1:18-cr-00084-JAW Document 410 Filed 06/06/22 Page 4 of 7           PageID #: 1563




correct that Mr. McKinney has not filed his habeas corpus petition challenging the

BOP’s calculation of his good time deductions in the correct United States District

Court. Mr. McKinney must file his petition in the district where he is currently

incarcerated, not the district where he was sentenced. See, e.g., Jennings v. Holt, 326

F. App’x 628, 630 (3d Cir. 2009) (“A § 2241 petition must be filed in the district where

the petitioner is confined”). According to Mr. McKinney’s motion, he is currently

located at the Schuylkill Federal Correctional Institution in Minersville,

Pennsylvania.     The United States District Court for the Middle District of

Pennsylvania, not this Court, is therefore the proper court in which to bring this

motion.

      In addition to filing his petition in the correct United States District Court,

there is a further procedural requirement that Mr. McKinney should be aware of

when challenging his good time deductions: exhaustion of his administrative

remedies. “Although 28 U.S.C. § 2241 contains no express exhaustion requirement,

‘[o]rdinarily, federal prisoners are required to exhaust their administrative remedies

prior to seeking a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241.’” Ward v.

White, Nos. 1:19-CV-787 & 1:19-CV-862, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107922, at *9 (M.D.

Pa. June 26, 2019) (quoting Gambino v. Morris, 134 F.3d 156, 171 (3d Cir. 1998)).

      In Ward v. White the court explained the proper procedure for exhausting

administrative remedies:

      An inmate first must informally present his complaint to staff, and staff
      shall attempt to informally resolve any issue before an inmate files a
      request for administrative relief. 28 C.F.R. § 542.13(a). If unsuccessful
      at informal resolution, the inmate may raise his complaint with the



                                           4
Case 1:18-cr-00084-JAW Document 410 Filed 06/06/22 Page 5 of 7          PageID #: 1564




      warden of the institution where he is confined. 28 C.F.R. § 542.14(a). If
      dissatisfied with the response, he may then appeal an adverse decision
      to the Regional Office and the Central Office of the BOP. 28 C.F.R. §§
      542.15(a), 542.18. No administrative appeal is considered finally
      exhausted until a decision is reached on the merits by the BOP’s Central
      Office.


2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107922, at *10-11 (quoting Miceli v. Martinez, No. 08-1380,

2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71877, at *6-7 (M.D. Pa. Sept. 15, 2008)). It is only after these

administrative steps with the prison and BOP offices have been exhausted that a

federal prisoner may bring a habeas corpus petition in federal court. The Third

Circuit imposes this administrative exhaustion requirement in order to: “(1) allow[]

the appropriate agency to develop a factual record and apply its expertise facilitates

judicial review; (2) permit[] agencies to grant the relief requested conserves judicial

resources; and (3) provid[e] agencies the opportunity to correct their own errors [to]

foster[] administrative autonomy.” Id. at *11 (quoting Moscato v. Fed. Bureau of

Prisons, 98 F.3d 757, 761-62 (3d Cir. 1996)).

      Relevant to Mr. McKinney’s petition, both the Third Circuit and the Middle

District of Pennsylvania have held that challenges to good time deductions are subject

to this administrative exhaustion requirement. In other words, a federal prisoner

must initially bring the dispute to the BOP, and only if they are unsuccessful may

they file a habeas petition with the United States District Court in the district where

they are incarcerated, which in Mr. McKinney’s case is the United States District

Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. See Jackson v. Virgin Islands, 272 F.

App’x 179, 180-81 (3d Cir. 2008) (concluding that a challenge to the calculation of




                                          5
Case 1:18-cr-00084-JAW Document 410 Filed 06/06/22 Page 6 of 7          PageID #: 1565




good time credits is subject to administrative exhaustion requirements); Broderick v.

Howard, No. 4:19-CV-02209, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118723, at *3 (M.D. Pa. July 7,

2020) (explaining that a habeas petition seeking the award of additional good time

credits should be dismissed because the petitioner did not exhaust his administrative

remedies); Luciano v. White, No. 1:19-cv-348, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83763, at *5

(M.D. Pa. May 17, 2019) (applying the administrative exhaustion requirement to a

request for recalculation of good time credits under the First Step Act).

       Mr. McKinney’s confusion as to whether this Court has the authority to change

the calculation of his good time deductions is understandable since it was this Court,

and not the BOP, that sentenced him. However, because, as Mr. McKinney notes,

the BOP is in charge of executing his sentence, he must bring his good time deduction

issues first to the BOP. In this particular case, there is no evidence on the record or

in Mr. McKinney’s motion that he has exhausted his administrative remedies. As a

result, the Court determines that it is appropriate to dismiss Mr. McKinney’s motion

without prejudice, rather than transfer it to the United States District Court for the

Middle District of Pennsylvania, so that he may first exhaust his administrative

remedies with the BOP before refiling in the correct court.

III.   CONCLUSION

       The Court AFFIRMS the Magistrate Judge’s Recommended Decision on

Petition for Postconviction Relief (ECF No. 409) and DISMISSES without prejudice

Rashaad McKinney’s Motion for Habeas Relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 (ECF No. 408).
