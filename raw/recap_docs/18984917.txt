                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 11-cr-23-PB

Ryan Schetzen


                                  O R D E R


     The defendant has moved through counsel to continue the

September 7, 2011 trial in the above case citing the need for

additional time to engage in plea negotiations or prepare for

trial.    The government does not object to a continuance of the

trial date.

     Accordingly, in order to allow the parties additional time

to properly prepare for trial, the court will continue the trial

from September 7, 2011 to October 4, 2011. In agreeing to

continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. '

3161(h)(7)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the ends of

justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the best

interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
