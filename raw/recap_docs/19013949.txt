                   UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                         DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE




United States of America

       v.                                   Criminal No. 12-cr-101-01-JD
Ryan Howe



                                    0 R D E R

       On August 8, 2012, a federal grand ]ury returned an

indictment charging Ryan Howe with being a felon in possession of

a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C.          §    922(g) (1)   ("Count One") and

possession of an unregistered firearm in violation of 26 U.S.C.

§§   5841, 5845(a), 5861(d) and 5871.            Howe moves to dismiss Count

One.       The government objects to the motion.



                                   Background

       Howe was convicted of carrying a firearm without a license

in violation of N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann ("RSA") 159:4, a class B

felony, on May 12, 1995.         He received a deferred sentence of a

maximum of two years in prison and was placed on probation.                On

August 22, 1997, Howe was convicted of violating his probation,

and was sentenced to one year in prison.              He finished serving his

sentence and was released from prison in late 2000. 1               Howe was

       1
      Howe began serving his sentence in August 1997 but was
granted bail pending appeal in November 1997. He lost his appeal
in April 2000, and resumed serving his sentence in July 2000.
Therefore, although Howe was sentenced in 1997 to a prison term
of one year, he finished serving his sentence in late 2000.

also convicted of disorderly conduct on May 13, 2002, and fined

$250.
        Howe is charged with being a felon in possession of a

firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) (1)          ("Count One") and

possession of an unregistered firearm in violation of 26 U.S.C.

§§ 5841, 5845(a), 5861(d) and 5871.          He moves to dismiss Count

One.



                                  Discussion

        In support of his motion to dismiss, Howe argues that he is

not a felon for purposes of§ 922(g) (1) because his civil rights,

including his right to serve on a jury, had been restored before

the time of the alleged offense.           The government contends that

Howe's right to serve on a jury had not been restored because his

conviction had not been annulled.



A.      Felon for Purposes of§ 922(g) (1)

        Section 922(g) (1) makes it illegal for anyone "who has been

convicted in any court of,       [sic] a crime punishable by

imprisonment for a term exceeding one year" to possess a firearm.

Section 921(a) (20) provides:

        Any conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or
        for which a person has been pardoned or has had his
        civil rights restored shall not be considered a
        conviction for purposes of this chapter, unless such
        pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights
        expressly provides that the person may not ship,
        transport, possess, or receive firearms.

Therefore, § 922(g) (1) provides an exception for those who have

had their civil rights restored after conviction of a felony.

See United States v. Hartsock, 347 F. 3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2003);

United States v. Bartelho, 71 F.3d 436, 440 (1st Cir. 1995).           In

the First Circuit, "the civil rights that must be restored to

trigger the exception are the rights to vote, to hold public

office, and to serve on a jury."         United States v. Estrella, 104

F.3d 3, 5-6 (1st Cir. 1997); see also United States v. Blodgett,

130 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1997).

     Howe and the government agree that Howe's right to vote and

hold public office were restored before September 15, 2011, when

he was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm in

violation of§ 922(g) (1).      See RSA 607-A:2    (providing that a

person sentenced for a felony may not vote in an election or hold

public office "from the time of his sentencing until his final

discharge").    They disagree, however, as to whether Howe's right

to serve on a jury was restored prior to his alleged violation of

§ 922(g) (1).   Therefore, whether Howe was a felon under§

922(g) (1) depends on whether his right to serve on a jury was

restored.



B.   Right to Serve on a Jury

     RSA 500-A:7-a provides: "[a] juror shall not have been

convicted of any felony which has not been annulled or which is

not eligible for annulment under New Hampshire law."           Howe argues


                                     3
       Case 1:12-cr-00101-JD Document 17 Filed 10/04/12 Page 4 of 6




that the proper interpretation of 500-A:7-a prohibits jury

service by a felon whose (1) conviction has not been annulled or

(2) conviction is not yet eligible to be annulled.           He contends

that because his conviction became eligible for annulment several

years before September 15, 2011, his right to serve on a jury had

been restored at the time of the charged offense.

     The government does not dispute that Howe's felony

conviction was eligible to be annulled under New Hampshire law at

the time of his alleged violation of       §   922(g) (1).   It contends,

however, that RSA 500-A:7-a prohibits jury service by anyone

convicted of a felony which has yet to be annulled or which could

never be annulled.     The government argues that because Howe's

felony conviction was not annulled, his right to serve on a jury

was not restored.

     "It is 'a cardinal principle of statutory construction' that

'a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it

can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be

superfluous, void, or insignificant.'"          United States v. Cortes-

Claudio, 312 F.3d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 2002)         (quoting Duncan v.

Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 174 (2001)).       Therefore,     "no construction

should be adopted which would render statutory words or phrases

meaningless [or] redundant."      United States v. Ven-Fuel. Inc.,

758 F.2d 741, 751-52    (1st Cir. 1985).

     In this case, the government's reading of RSA 500-A:7-a

would render the language "which is eligible for annulment"


                                    4
          Case 1:12-cr-00101-JD Document 17 Filed 10/04/12 Page 5 of 6




meaningless.     Under the government's reading, the statute

prohibits the following two types of felons from serving on a

jury:    (1) those whose felony convictions have not been annulled,

and (2) those whose felony convictions are in the class of

felonies that are never eligible for annulment, such as violent

crimes or crimes of obstruction of justice, see RSA 651:5(V).

Such a reading, however, would render reference to the second

type of felon superfluous, as a person convicted of one of the

class of felonies which can never be annulled would be, by

definition, a person whose felony conviction has not been

annulled.     In other words, under the government's reading, if the

phrase "or which is eligible for annulment" were eliminated from

the statute, the statute would still have the same effect.               Thus,

the government's interpretation makes part of the statute

superfluous and violates a basic principle of statutory

construction.

        Under the plain meaning of the statute, an individual who

has committed a felony may serve on a jury if his conviction is

eligible for annulment.        RSA 651:5(III) (d) provides,     "any person

convicted of [a class B felony] may petition for annulment of the

record of arrest, conviction, and sentence where the petitioner

has completed all the terms and conditions of the sentence and

has thereafter been convicted of no other crime .              . for a

period of .      . 5 years."     Howe was convicted of a class B felony

and completed the terms and conditions of his sentence for his


                                      5
        Case 1:12-cr-00101-JD Document 17 Filed 10/04/12 Page 6 of 6




felony conviction in 2000.      Howe's last criminal conviction,       for

disorderly conduct, was on May 13, 2002, more than five years

before his alleged violation of§ 922(g) (1).          Therefore, under

§ 651:5(III) (d), Howe's felony conviction was "eligible for

annulment under New Hampshire law" on September 15, 2011, when he

was charged with a violation of§ 922(g) (1).          Therefore, his

right to serve on a jury had been restored at that time.

      Accordingly, because Howe's civil rights were restored at

the time of his alleged violation of § 922(g) (1), he is not

considered a felon under that statute.



                                Conclusion

      For the foregoing reasons,     the defendant's motion to dismiss

Count One (document no. 8) is granted.

      SO ORDERED.
