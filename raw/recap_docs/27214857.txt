               ORDER AFFIRMING RECOMMENDED DECISION
                      OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE


      On February 28, 2018, the United States Magistrate Judge filed with the
court, with copies to the parties, his Recommended Decision on Motion to Modify
Sentence. On March 16, 2018, the Post Office informed the Clerk’s Office that
the Notice sent to the defendant was undeliverable. BOP supplied a new address
for defendant and the notice was remailed. The extended time within which to
file objections expired on April 27, 2018, and no objection has been filed. The
Magistrate Judge notified the parties that failure to object would waive their right
to de novo review and appeal.
      It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the Magistrate
Judge is hereby ADOPTED. The defendant’s motion is DENIED. To the extent the
motion is construed to be a 28 U.S.C. § 2255 motion, I DENY a certificate of
appealability pursuant to Rule 11 of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Cases
because there is no substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right
within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2255(c)(2).

      SO ORDERED.

      DATED THIS 8TH DAY OF MAY, 2018
                                               /S/D. BROCK HORNBY
