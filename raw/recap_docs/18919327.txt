     v.                              Case No. 09-cr-45-01-PB

                                     ORDER

     Re: Document No. 25, Motion to Request Assistance obtaining
supplies

     Ruling: I have determined that the defendant does not need
access to Black’s Law Dictionary to prepare his defense, nor does
he require a memory stick. The facility where he is housed shall
provide him with access to a copy machine to make copies of cases
and legal materials that are related to his defense at no cost. In
all other respects, the defendant’s motion is denied.
