                   IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                     FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO



MEDINA-CRUZ,

          PETITIONER

              v.
                                         CRIM NO. 12-649 (JAG)
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

          RESPONDENT.




                            MEMORANDUM & ORDER


      In    this   case,   Xiomara   Medina-Cruz    (“Medina-Cruz”)       pled

guilty to violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1951, 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) and

(2) for her armed robbery of a pharmacy. (See Docket No. 43).

The Court accepted her plea of guilty, (Docket No. 45), and

sentenced her to sixty months of imprisonment. (Docket No. 53).

The Court entered Judgment on February 4, 2014; defendant did

not appeal, and so the Judgment became final and firm thirty

days later, on March 6, 2013. (Docket No. 54).


      Now before the Court is Medina-Cruz’s motion for habeas

relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Medina-Cruz petitions the Court

for   a    resentencing,   arguing   that   her    original   sentence     is

invalid under Alleyne v. United States, 133 S. Ct. 2151, 2153,

186 L. Ed. 2d 314 (2013). Her petition lacks merit.

CRIM NO. 12-649 (JAG)                                                      2
 
       So far, at least seven circuit courts have found, either as

a holding or in dicta, that Alleyne does not apply retroactively

to cases in which final judgment has been entered. See e.g.

United States v. Redd, 735 F.3d 88 (2d Cir. 2013); United States

v. Winkelman, 2014 WL 1228194 (3d Cir. 2014); United States v.

Stewart, 540 F. App'x 171 (4th Cir. 2013); In re Kemper, 735

F.3d 211 (5th Cir. 2013); Simpson v. United States, 721 F.3d 875

(7th Cir. 2013); In re Payne, 733 F.3d 1027 (10th Cir. 2013);

United States v. Harris, 741 F.3d 1245 (11th Cir. 2014). Alleyne

was    decided   more   than    four    months    after     final   judgment   was

entered in this case. As such, Petitioner is not entitled to

seek    relief    through      the     Supreme    Court's     pronouncement     in

Alleyne. Motion denied.


IT IS SO ORDERED.

In San Juan, Puerto Rico, this 22nd day of May, 2014.
