           ORDER ON DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO RECONSIDER

      Kenneth Sales moves this Court to reconsider a January 9, 2014 order denying

his motion to dismiss the indictment. (ECF No. 73). The one-count indictment,

returned on July 23, 2013, charges Sales under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9) with possession

of a firearm by an individual convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.

The Defendant asserts that his prior conviction under a Vermont simple assault

statute does not qualify as a “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence” under 18

U.S.C. § 922(g)(9). This Court previously held, under United States v. Booker, 644

F.3d 12 (1st Cir. 2011), that Sales’s conviction for recklessly inflicting bodily injury

on his girlfriend was a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. Order on Def.s’ Mot.

to Dismiss Indictment. (ECF No. 56).

      Sales requests that the Court reconsider its decision in light of three recent

cases: the Supreme Court’s opinion in United States v. Castleman, 134 S. Ct. 1405

(2014), the Supreme Court’s remand order in Armstrong v. United States, 134 S.Ct.

1759 (2014), and the First Circuit’s opinion in United States v. Carter, 752 F. 3d 8




                                           1
(1st Cir. 2014). The Defendant contends that, in light of these decisions, the Court

should dismiss the indictment against him.

                                  BACKGROUND

 I.   The Underlying State Conviction

      On December 16, 2010, at a change of plea hearing, Kenneth Sales pled guilty

to one count of “ASSAULT–SIMPLE—MUTUAL AFFRAY” under 13 Vt. Stat. Ann.

tit. 13, § 1023. Exh. 1 to Def's Mot. to Dismiss 5 (ECF No. 28-1). Count one stated:

“Kenneth Sales, in this Territorial Unit, in the County of Bennington, at Arlington,

on or about October 17, 2010 . . . engaged in a fight or scuffle entered into by mutual

consent.” Exh. 2 to Gov't's Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss (ECF No. 31-2).

      Vermont’s simple assault statute states:

      (a) A person is guilty of simple assault if he or she:
          (1) attempts to cause or purposely, knowingly or recklessly causes
              bodily injury to another; or
          (2) negligently causes bodily injury to another with a deadly weapon;
              or
          (3) attempts by physical menace to put another in fear of imminent
              serious bodily injury.
      (b) A person who is convicted of simple assault shall be imprisoned for
          not more than one year or fined not more than $1,000.00, or both,
          unless the offense is committed in a fight or scuffle entered into by
          mutual consent, in which case a person convicted of simple assault
          shall be imprisoned not more than 60 days or fined not more than
          $500.00 or both.

Vt. Stat. Ann. tit.13, § 1023.

      As part of his December 16, 2010 plea colloquy, the Vermont Superior Court

judge explained:

      Mr. Sales, you now have an amended charge, that on or about October
      17th, you recklessly caused bodily injury to a person, and that it was in

                                          2
      a fight or scuffle entered into by mutual consent. Penalty of up to 60
      days in jail or a $500 fine. The basis for this as I understand it is that
      you would be admitting that there was a physical altercation between
      you and Ms. Goddard . . . and that in the course of it you at least
      recklessly . . . caused bodily injury to her, being . . . a scratch or a sort of
      cut that she received. Bodily injury is any sort of injury, it doesn't have
      to be a broken bone or anything like that, it can be a bruise, a cut, kind
      of anything that hurts. . . . [R]ecklessly means you did not have to intend
      a particular result, but you engaged in conduct that was not what a
      reasonable person would do in these circumstances, and had a very high
      risk that the result would happen. So obviously engaging in a fight or
      scuffle would qualify as that. . . . [F]ight or scuffle is pretty much what
      you'd think it would mean. . . . [M]utual consent just means that the two
      of you sort of engaged in the fight or scuffle, rather than one person . . .
      solely.

Sales then acknowledged that he understood the amended charge and pleaded guilty

to it. Exh. 4 to Gov’t’s Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. to Dismiss 1 (ECF No. 31-4).

      Based on the foregoing, this Court previously concluded that the Defendant

“admitted to engaging in a physical altercation in which he recklessly caused his

girlfriend bodily injury” and “was convicted of simple assault of the § 1023(a)(1)

variety.” United States v. Sales, 2:13-CR-137-NT, 2014 WL 103813, *4 (D. Me. Jan.

9, 2014).

II.   The Pending Federal Charge

      Sales was charged with a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9), sometimes referred

to as the Lautenberg Amendment to the Gun Control Act of 1968. The indictment

alleges that, on about May 6, 2013, Sales knowingly possessed a .45 caliber pistol

after having been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, specifically

his December 16, 2010 conviction from Vermont. Section 922(g)(9) prohibits a person

“who has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence”



                                             3
from “possess[ing] in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition . . . .”18

U.S.C. § 922(g)(9). Section 921 defines “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence” as

an offense that:

      (i) is a misdemeanor under Federal, State, or Tribal law; and

      (ii) has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the
      threatened use of a deadly weapon, committed by a current or former
      spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim, by a person with whom the
      victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabiting with or
      has cohabited with the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian, or by a
      person similarly situated to a spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim[.]

18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(33)(A).

      On January 27, 2014, the Defendant tendered a conditional plea of guilty to

the indictment, reserving the right to have an appellate court review this Court’s

decision denying his motion to dismiss the indictment.

                                     DISCUSSION

      The question at hand is whether a conviction for recklessly causing bodily

injury to another under Vermont’s assault statute is a misdemeanor crime of

domestic violence under § 922(g)(9). Specifically at issue is whether the reckless

variant of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit.13, § 1023(a) has “as an element, the use . . . of physical

force.” 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(33)(A).

      The Cases

      The contours of what constitutes a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence

have been shaped by a number of First Circuit cases that have dealt with the Maine




                                           4
assault statute.1 In United States v. Nason, 269 F.3d 10 (1st Cir. 2001), the First

Circuit held that the “offensive physical contact” variant of Maine’s assault statute

satisfies the use of force requirement under § 921(a)(33)(A) and thus can qualify as a

misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. Id. at 21. In United States v. Booker, 644

F.3d 12 (1st Cir. 2011), the First Circuit held that “an offense with a mens rea of

recklessness may qualify as a ‘misdemeanor crime of domestic violence’ under

922(g)(9).” Id. at 21. In United States v. Armstrong, 706 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2013), cert.

granted, judgment vacated, 134 S. Ct. 1759 (2014), the defendant was convicted of

“intentionally, knowingly or recklessly caus[ing] bodily injury or offensive physical

contact” to his wife. Armstrong, 706 F.3d at 3. The First Circuit, relying on Nason

and Booker, affirmed Armstrong’s § 922(g)(9) conviction. United States v. Armstrong,

706 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2013),

        On March 26, 2014, the Supreme Court issued United States v. Castleman, 134

S.Ct. 1405 (2014), in which it held that “the requirement of ‘physical force’ is satisfied,



1       Maine’s simple assault statute provides: “A person is guilty of assault if . . . the person
intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes bodily injury or offensive physical contact to another
person.” Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 17-A, § 207(1)(A).
        Generally, to determine whether a state offense qualifies as a predicate offense, courts use a
categorical approach, which necessitates “an assessment of ‘the elements of the statute of conviction’”
rather than the actual facts of the defendant’s conduct. United States v. Fish, No. 12-1791, 2014 WL
715785 * 3 (1st Cir. Feb. 26, 2014) (quoting Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 601 (1990)). Because,
however, the Maine assault statute “‘sets out one or more elements of the offense in the alternative,’”
it is considered a divisible statute, which allows a different analysis known as the “modified”
categorical approach. United States v. Carter, 752 F.3d at 17 (quoting Descamps v. United States, 133
S.Ct. 2276, 2281-82 (2013)). Under the modified categorical approach, a court is “permitted to ‘consult
a limited class of documents, such as indictments and jury instructions, to determine which alternative
formed the basis of the defendant’s prior conviction.’” Fish, 2014 WL 715785 *3 (quoting Descamps,
133 S.Ct. at 2281-82; citing Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 17, 26 (2005)). Reference to the so-
called Shepard documents allows the court to consider “the narrower subset of elements that actually
gave rise to the convictions.” Fish, 2014 WL 715785 *3.


                                                   5
for purposes of § 922(g)(9), by the degree of force that supports a common-law battery

conviction,” that is, “even the slightest offensive touching.” Id. at 1413 and 1410.

Because Castleman was charged with intentionally or knowingly causing bodily

injury to the victim, see Castleman, 134 S. Ct. at 1408, the Supreme Court did not

need to address whether a recklessly-caused bodily injury would suffice to meet the

definition of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. On that point, the Castleman

court observed that “the merely reckless causation of bodily injury . . . may not be a

‘use’ of force.” Id. at 1414. The Court noted that Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. 1, 9

(2004),2 held that “use” requires active employment “rather than negligent or merely

accidental conduct.” Castleman, 134 S. Ct. at 1414 n. 8. The Supreme Court also

pointed out that Booker is out of step with other circuit courts that have held that

recklessness is not sufficient to constitute a “use” of force. Id.3


2       In Leocal, the Supreme Court held that a driving under the influence of alcohol conviction does
not constitute an “aggravated felony” under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). 8 U.S.C. §
1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The INA defines the term “aggravated felony” to include a “crime of violence” as
defined under 18 U.S.C. § 16, which, in turn, refers to “an offense that has as an element the use,
attempted use, or threatened use of physical force . . . .” 18 U.S.C. § 16. The Supreme Court concluded
that the term “‘use . . . of physical force against the person or property of another’—most naturally
suggests a higher degree of intent than negligent or merely accidental conduct.” Leocal, 543 U.S. at
11. The Leocal Court took pains to point out that the “case does not present us with the question
whether a state or federal offense that requires proof of the reckless use of force against a person or
property of another qualifies as a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. § 16.” Id. at 13 (emphasis in
original).
3       Of the cases cited by the Supreme Court, none involved the application of § 922(g)(9). Most
addressed whether prior felonies, committed recklessly, could constitute crimes of violence sufficient
either to trigger a sixteen point enhancement under the sentencing guidelines for people charged with
immigration offenses or to serve as “aggravated felonies” for the purposes of deportation. See United
States v. Palomino Garcia, 606 F.3d 1317, 1335–1336 (11th Cir. 2010) (felony aggravated assault
committed recklessly lacked use of force as required for sentencing guidelines); Jimenez–Gonzalez v.
Mukasey, 548 F.3d 557, 560 (7th Cir. 2008) (felony criminal recklessness not an aggravated felony
warranting removal); United States v. Zuniga–Soto, 527 F.3d 1110, 1124 (10th Cir. 2008) (felony
reckless assault of a public servant not a crime of violence for sentencing guidelines); United States v.
Torres–Villalobos, 487 F.3d 607, 615–616 (8th Cir. 2007) (second-degree manslaughter conviction not
an aggravated felony for sentencing purposes); United States v. Portela, 469 F.3d 496, 499 (6th Cir.
2006) (felony reckless vehicular assault not a felony crime of violence for sentencing guidelines); Garcia

                                                    6
        Five days after it decided Castleman, the Supreme Court vacated the First

Circuit’s judgment in Armstrong, “for further consideration in light of United States

v. Castleman . . . .” Armstrong v. United States, 134 S. Ct. 1759 (2014). Castleman

supports Armstrong’s holding that offensive touching is sufficient to satisfy the

definition of “use of physical force.” Therefore, the Supreme Court’s remand of

Armstrong “in light of Castleman” is fairly construed as a directive to the First Circuit

to reconsider whether an assault committed recklessly is sufficient to meet the federal

definition of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.

        On April 30, 2014, before the First Circuit had reconsidered Armstrong, it

issued an opinion remanding United States v. Carter, 752 F. 3d 8 (1st Cir. 2014) to

the district court.4 Carter also involved an undifferentiated Maine assault conviction.

In Carter, the First Circuit acknowledged that “Castleman casts doubt” on Booker’s

holding that a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence encompasses assault

committed recklessly. Carter, 752 F.3d at 18. Rather than expressly overrule Booker,




v. Gonzales, 455 F.3d 465, 468–469 (4th Cir. 2006) (reckless assault in the second-degree not an
aggravated felony warranting removal); Oyebanji v. Gonzales, 418 F.3d 260, 263–265 (3d Cir. 2005)
(ALITO, J.) (conviction for reckless vehicular homicide not an aggravated felony warranting removal);
Jobson v. Ashcroft, 326 F.3d 367, 373 (2d Cir. 2003) (second-degree manslaughter not an aggravated
felony warranting removal); United States v. Chapa–Garza, 243 F.3d 921, 926 (5th Cir. 2001)
(conviction for driving while intoxicated not an aggravated felony warranting removal); cf. Fernandez–
Ruiz v. Gonzales, 466 F.3d 1121, 1127–1132 (C.A.9 2006) (en banc) (reckless misdemeanor domestic
violence conviction not a crime of violence warranting removal).
4        By the time Castleman was decided, Carter had already been fully briefed. The Defendant
submitted a citation of supplemental authorities pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(j)
calling the First Circuit’s attention to Castleman. United States v. Carter, CA No. 12-1499, (Document:
00116666144) Letter from J. Hilary Billings, Ass’t. Federal Public Defender to Margaret Carter, Clerk,
U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (Mar. 26, 2014). The Government responded with its own
letter also calling the First Circuit’s attention to the remand of Armstrong. United States v. Carter, CA
No. 12-1499, (Document: 00116669158) Letter from Renee M. Bunker, Ass’t. U.S. Attorney to Margaret
Cater, Clerk, U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (Apr. 2, 2014).

                                                   7
the First Circuit remanded Carter to determine which mens rea prong of the Maine

assault statute served as the basis for Carter’s conviction.

       The order remanding the case directed the district court to conduct “further

proceedings consistent with this opinion and in light of the Supreme Court’s opinion

in Castleman and its vacation of our judgment in Armstrong.” Carter, 752 F.3d at 21

(citations omitted). Upon remand, Judge Singal concluded that the “guidance of the

Supreme Court and the First Circuit in Castleman, Armstrong and Carter” was clear

enough for him to conclude that a § 922(g)(9) “conviction may only stand if it was

premised on more than accidental, negligent or reckless conduct.” United States v.

Carter, No. 2:10-CR-00155-GZS, slip op. at 9 (D. Me. July 8, 2014).

       In United States v. Hines, 1:12-CR-204-JAW, 2014 WL 1875164 (D. Me. May

9, 2014), Judge Woodcock addressed a post-Castleman challenge to the use of a Maine

assault conviction as a predicate offense under § 922(g)(9), and he also concluded:

“based on Castleman, Armstrong and Carter, . . . it is so questionable whether a

conviction for domestic assault under 17-A M.R.S. § 207-A(1)(A) – without more –

may operate as a predicate conviction under § 922(g)(9), that this Court must grant

Mr. Hines a new trial.” Hines, 2014 WL 1875164 * 9.

       2.     Analysis of the Instant Case

       The Vermont simple assault statute applicable here proscribes “purposely,

knowingly or recklessly caus[ing] bodily injury . . . .” 13 V.S.A. § 1023(a)(1). It is clear

from the Shepard-approved documents in this case that the Defendant was convicted

under the “reckless” prong of this statute. The Government does not argue otherwise.



                                             8
        The Government contends that the First Circuit has not overturned Booker

and that this Court cannot reach a conclusion contrary to Booker’s holding that

reckless conduct is a “use of force” for purposes of § 922(g)(9). As the Government

points out, “[u]ntil a court of appeals revokes a binding precedent, a district court

within the circuit is hard put to ignore that precedent unless it has been cast into

disrepute by supervening authority.” Eulitt v. Me. Dep’t of Educ., 386 F.3d 344, 349

(1st Cir. 2004). But as both Judges Woodcock and Singal have determined, the lower

courts “cannot ignore the guidance of the Supreme Court and the First Circuit in

Castleman, Armstrong and Carter.” United States v. Carter, No. 2:10-CR-00155 (D.

Me., July 8, 2014) (ECF No. 98). While “[r]eading Supreme Court tea leaves is

chancy,” Hines, 1:12-CR-00204-JAW, 2014 WL 1857164 at *8, it is hard to miss the

message here. Upon closer scrutiny, the First Circuit may decide that recklessness is

sufficient in the § 922(g)(9) context,5 but given the writing on the wall in Carter, it

would be presumptuous for this Court to make that determination.




5        The cases cited by the Supreme Court in footnote eight of Castleman all arise out of the
immigration context and can thus be distinguished. By the logic of Castleman and its use of the
legislative history, it is possible that Booker could survive. See Castleman, 134 S. Ct. at 1411 (“because
perpetrators of domestic violence are ‘routinely prosecuted under generally applicable assault or
battery laws,’ it makes sense for Congress to have classified as a ‘misdemeanor crime of domestic
violence’ the type of conduct that supports a common-law battery conviction.” (quoting United States
v. Hayes, 555 U.S. 415, 427 (2009)).

                                     CONCLUSION

      For the above-stated reasons, the Defendant’s Motion for Reconsideration is

GRANTED and the indictment is DISMISSED.
