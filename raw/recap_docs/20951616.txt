                                          May 23, 2017

TALWANI, D.J.

       The Presentence Investigation Report (“PSR”) prepared for Defendant Gustavo Moto’s

sentencing did not categorize his prior conviction for Assault and Battery with a Dangerous

Weapon, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 15A(b), as a “felony conviction of . . . a crime of violence”

under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (“USSG”) § 2K2.1(a)(4)(A). PSR ¶ 21, n.1. The

government objected in its Sentencing Memorandum [#23] and at sentencing, arguing that

Defendant’s prior conviction should be so categorized, thereby increasing his base offense level

from 14 to 20, and nearly doubling his guideline advisory range. The objection is overruled.

       A “crime of violence” under USSG § 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) has the meaning given that term in

§ 4B1.2(a). Application Note 1 of Commentary to USSG § 2K2.1. Under USSG § 4B1.2(a), a

crime of violence includes “[a]ny offense under federal or state law, punishable for a term

exceeding one year, that— (1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of

physical force against the person of another.”

       In United States v. Tavares, 843 F.3d 1, 18 (1st Cir. 2016), the First Circuit discussed

whether Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 15A(b), is a “crime of violence” under USSG

§ 4B1.2(a)(1). The court noted that the crime is divisible, with two differing mens rea: “(1) [t]he
intentional and unjustified touching of another by use of dangerous weapon, or, (2) [t]he

intentional commission of a wanton or reckless act [with a dangerous weapon] causing more than

transient or trifling injury to another.” Tavares, 843 F.3d at 14.1 The court further stated—and

the parties here agree—that but for the Supreme Court’s decision in Voisine v. United States,

136 S.Ct. 2272 (2016), the “reckless” version is not a felony crime of violence. See Tavares, 843

F.3d at 18 (“Thus, [United States v. Fish, 758 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2014)] would dictate that a

conviction for the reckless version of ABDW is not a crime of violence under U.S.S.G.

§ 4B1.2(a)(1).”).

       Tavares declined to reach whether Voisine altered this circuit’s law in part to allow the

issue to develop in the district courts. Here, where the government lacks Shephard documents to

prove Defendant’s prior conviction was for the “intentional” version, the issue is squarely

presented.

       Voisine analyzed 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9), which prohibits firearm possession by those

convicted of a “misdemeanor crime of violence.” That phrase is defined as misdemeanors that

have “as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly

weapon,” committed by a victim’s domestic relation. 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(33)(A). Voisine found

that a “misdemeanor crime of violence” contains no exclusion for convictions based on reckless

behavior. 136 S.Ct. at 2280. But it did so in a context distinct from the context here. Specifically,



1
  Both theories require that the offense involve a dangerous weapon, which includes “both items
that are dangerous ‘per se’ and otherwise innocuous items that, as used, are ‘capable of
producing serious bodily harm.’” United States v. Fish, 758 F.3d 1, 9 n.3 (1st Cir. 2014) (quoting
United States v. Hart, 674 F.3d 33, 42-43 (1st Cir. 2012)). If the act causes serious bodily injury,
it is chargeable under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 15A(c), and is subject to greater punishment.
Defendant here pleaded guilty to § 15A(b), not § 15A(c).



                                                  2
noting Congressional intent to remedy the poisonous mixture of domestic violence and guns, the

Voisine opinion explored the “relevant history” of § 921(a)(33)(A) and observed that Congress

intended to take guns from the hands “garden-variety” misdemeanants in the domestic abuse

context. 136 S.Ct. at 2280. In contrast to this public safety policy determination extending to

misdemeanors, USSG § 2K2.1(4) operates to suggest augmented punishment of those previously

convicted of violent felonies. Cf. Johnson v. United States, 559 U.S. 133, 141-43 (2010) (noting

potential incongruity in importing into the felony context a jurisprudence formulated in the

misdemeanor context). Indeed, the Voisine decision itself cautioned that these “differences in . . .

contexts and purposes” might require divergent readings of similar language found in different

statutes, 136 S.Ct. at 2280 n.4, and the court finds such caution prudent in this case. Congress’

intent to divest categories of persons, including those convicted of certain misdemeanors, from

gun ownership is of a different kind than the Sentencing Commission’s intent to secure proper

and consistent punishment of individuals with prior convictions for violent felonies.

       What is more, “Congress’ basic goal in passing the Sentencing Act was to move the

sentencing system in the direction of increased uniformity.” See United States v. Booker, 543

U.S. 220, 254 (2005). A “critically important” aspect of this desired uniformity is a tightened

nexus between a defendant’s sentence and “real-conduct,” id. at 255, and this court must

therefore contemplate this nexus in determining what “particular sentence” is “sufficient, but not

greater than necessary,” to accomplish Congress’ stated goals of sentencing. 18 U.S.C. § 3553.

The Guidelines are intended to assist the court in making such assessments. See Rita v. United

States, 551 U.S. 338, 347-351 (2007). But expanding the breadth of felony “crimes of violence”

to encompass convictions that may be based only on “reckless” conduct — and thereby




                                                 3
expanding the range of conduct susceptible to identical enhancement—would inevitably render

the Guidelines less useful.

       Accordingly, as will be set forth in the Judgment and Statement of Reasons, the court

adopts the PSR in whole, overrules the government’s objection, and rejects the six-level

enhancement to the guideline calculation sought by the government.

       IT IS SO ORDERED.
