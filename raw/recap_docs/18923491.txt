                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 09-cr-45-PB

Scott Rogers


                                  O R D E R


     The defendant has moved to continue the trial scheduled for

December 1, 2009, citing the need for additional time review

additional discovery materials received from the government and

to respond to the superseding indictment.           The government does

not object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reasons and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from December 1, 2009 to March 2, 2010.               In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(7)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
