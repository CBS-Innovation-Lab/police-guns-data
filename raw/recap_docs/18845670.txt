                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                       DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIR E


United States of America

             V.                              Case No . 07-cr-8-01/02-SM

Melissa Allen and
Michael Guinier

                                    ORDER

      Defendant Guinier's motion to continue the final pretrial conference an d

trial is granted (document no . 48) . Trial has been rescheduled for the

February 2008 trial period . Defendant Guinier shall file a waiver of speedy

trial rights not later than December 3, 2007 . On the filing of such waiver, his

continuance shall be effective .

      The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendants in a speedy trial, 18

U.S .C . ยง 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would

unreasonably deny defendants the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances .

      Final Pretrial Conference :    January 30, 2008 at 4 :30 p .m.

      Jury Selection : February 5, 2008 at 9 :30 a .m .
