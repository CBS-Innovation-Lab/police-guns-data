  AUGUSTUS J. EDGERTON                         )

                      ORDER ON DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO STRIKE

           Augustus Edgerton, charged with making a false statement in an attempted

  acquisition of a firearm, a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(a)(6), moves to strike from the

  Indictment the phrase “likely to deceive” on the ground it is either unconstitutionally

  vague or so overbroad that it violates the First Amendment. The Indictment, in relevant

  part, reads:

           On or about April 1, 2004, in the District of Maine, [Mr. Edgerton] in
           connection with his attempted acquisition of a firearm . . . from . . . a
           licensed federal firearms dealer, knowingly made a false statement [on
           ATF Form 4473], which statement was intended or likely to deceive [the
           federally-licensed firearms dealer] with respect to a fact material to the
           lawfulness of the attempted acquisition of that firearm by the defendant . .
           ..

  Indictment (Docket # 1). The language of the Indictment tracks the statute 1 and the

  Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions for the District Courts of the First Circuit. 2



  1
    Title 18, United States Code, section 922(a)(6) provides in pertinent part:
            (a) It shall be unlawful –
            (6) for any person in connection with the acquisition or attempted acquisition of any
            firearm . . . from a . . . licensed dealer . . . knowingly to make any false or fictitious oral
            or written statement . . . intended or likely to deceive such . . . dealer . . . with respect to
            any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale or other disposition of such firearm . . .
            under the provisions of this chapter[.]
  2
    The Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions for the District Courts of the First Circuit, among other things, set
  forth the elements the Government must prove in a § 922(a)(6) prosecution:
            First, that [defendant] knowingly made a false statement as charged in the Indictment;
            Second, that at the time [he] made the statement, [defendant] was trying to buy a
            [firearm] from a [licensed dealer]; and
            Third, that the statement was intended to, or likely to, deceive the licensed dealer . . .
            about a fact material to the lawfulness of the sale.

         Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(d) empowers district courts to “strike

  surplusage from the indictment or informa tion” upon a defendant’s motion. But, Mr.

  Edgerton has not asked this Court to strike irrelevant, prejudicial surplusage from the

  language of the Indictment. See United States v. Cormier, 226 F.R.D. 23, 24-27 (D. Me.

  2005). Instead, Mr. Edgerton would have the Court strike an element of the crime. See

  JUDGE HORNBY’S 2005 R EVISIONS TO THE PATTERN CRIMINAL JURY INSTRUCTIONS FOR

  THE D ISTRICT   COURTS OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT § 4.18.922(a) (noting that the third element

  the Government must prove in a § 922(a)(6) action is that “the statement was intended to,

  or likely to, deceive the licensed dealer . . . about a fact material to the lawfulness of the

  sale.”) (emphasis supplied). This Court declines to do so.

         To the extent Mr. Edgerton claims the phrase, “likely to deceive,” is

  unconstitutionally vague or so overbroad it violates the First Amendment, he cites, and

  this Court has uncovered, no authority for either proposition. The First Circuit has

  considered the scienter requirement in firearms cases and has concluded that “‘(s)ection

  922(a)(6) does not require a showing that [a defendant] “knowingly” violated the law; it

  simply requires proof that [he] “knowingly” made a false statement.’” United States v.

  Currier, 621 F.2d 7, 10 (1st Cir. 1980) (quoting Cody v. United States, 460 F.2d 34, 38

  (8th Cir. 1972)). As drafted by Congress and as interpreted by the First Circuit, this

  statute is neither vague nor overbroad and has no conceivable impact on the exercise of

  rights guaranteed by the First Amendment.

         This Court DENIES the Defendant’s Motion to Strike (Docket # 45).
