           MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF MOTION FOR
             A SENTENCE OUTSIDE OF THE GUIDELINE RANGE

I. INTRODUCTION

       This memorandum is presented in support of the defendant's arguments as to

sentencing in this matter. The defendant stands convicted of conspiracy to affect

commerce by robbery and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence.

On the second count, the defendant must receive no less than a five year sentence,

consecutive to the sentence on Count 1. The guideline range as currently set forth in the

Presentence Report for Count 1 is 24-30 months. There is no dispute about the

calculation of the guideline range.

       The defense asks this Court to impose a sentence below the guideline range as to

Count 1.



II. THE DEFENDANT'S PERSONAL SITUATION

       The defendant is 21 years old. The defendant has no record of either adult or

juvenile adjudications and his extremely limited contact with the criminal justice system

is spelled out in paragraphs 30 through 33 of the Presentence Report. The defense is

submitting by letter format in support of this motion two letters from a sister of the

defendant and a friend of the defendant. The letters speak for themselves, but two

 Case 1:07-cr-00128-S-LDA           Document 29        Filed 01/14/2008       Page 3 of 6



themes emerge from the letters. The defendant is a decent, caring person. Second, he

will have a support system available to help him upon his release from incarceration.



III. THE FACTORS IN 18 U.S.C. §3553(a)

       The defense outlines the salient factors to consider as they relate to 18 U.S.C.

§3553 in assessing the sentence to impose upon the defendant. The United States

Supreme Court recently said:

           Accordingly, after giving both parties an opportunity to argue for
           whatever sentence they deem appropriate, the district judge should
           then consider all of the § 3553(a) factors to determine whether they
           support the sentence requested by a party. [Footnote omitted]

Gall v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445, 457 (U.S. 2007). The footnote

then lists the various factors to be considered. The defense submits that the mandatory

minimum sentence which is a consequence of the defendant's conviction on Count 2 has

a special impact on the Court's role with respect to Count 1. As the Supreme Court noted

in Gall, supra, not all Guidelines are tied to empirical evidence, the Court making specific

reference to drug offense guidelines. Id. at n. 2. The defense would note in this case that

5 years of any sentence the defendant will receive is not based on the empirical evidence

which underlies much of the guidelines, but is a function of the statutory mandate as to

the sentence for Count 2. The defense argues, however, that in considering an

appropriate sentence, this Court should consider the whole sentence to be imposed, not

just the sentence for Count 1.

       The defense next considers the factors in 18 U.S.C. §3553 that the defense

believes are of particular import in this case




                                                 2
 Case 1:07-cr-00128-S-LDA           Document 29         Filed 01/14/2008       Page 4 of 6



       1. 18 U.S.C. §3553(a)(1)

       The statute provides that the Court shall consider:

           (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and
           characteristics of the defendant;

       In this case, the history and characteristics of the defendant in particular, militate

in favor of a sentence below the guideline range. Not only is the defendant in Criminal

History Category I, but he has 0 criminal history points. Indeed, his prior contact with the

criminal justice system is very limited. Presentence Report at paragraphs 32 and 33. In

addition, the letters submitted in his support further buttress the sense that this defendant

has been a productive member of society in the past and can again become a productive

member of society. He is a high school graduate with a good employment record.

       2. 18 U.S.C. §3553(a)(2)(A)

       The statute provides the Court shall consider:

           the need for the sentence imposed --

           "(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for
           the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;

The defense submits that the five year sentence he will receive on Count 1 will

adequately reflect the factors set forth above. Indeed, the ability and willingness of the

legal system to recognize the value of giving a person who is essentially a first time

offender a sentence that is five years, rather than 7 or 7½ years (or more) enhances the

importance of not getting a record and promotes respect for the law.

       In Gall v. United States, the Court said:

           Moreover, the unique facts of Gall's situation provide support for the
           District Judge's conclusion that, in Gall's case, "a sentence of
           imprisonment may work to promote not respect, but derision, of the
           law if the law is viewed as merely a means to dispense harsh



                                              3
 Case 1:07-cr-00128-S-LDA          Document 29         Filed 01/14/2008       Page 5 of 6



          punishment without taking into account the real conduct and
          circumstances involved in sentencing." Id., at 126.

Gall v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed. 2d 445, 459-460 (U.S. 2007). The

defense submits that the argument on behalf of Mr. Phommarath is similar.



       3. 18 U.S.C. §3553(a)(2)(C)

       Another of the factors identified in 18 U.S.C. §3553(a) is:

               (2) the need for the sentence imposed-
               ...     (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the
                          defendant; and ….

18 U.S.C. §3553(a)(2)(C). This proviso in effect addresses the question of recidivism.

Clearly, one concern is what is the likelihood that the defendant will again commit

crimes. The defense refers the Court to the discussion above about the fact that the

defendant has 0 criminal history points.



        4. 18 U.S.C. §3553(a)(2)(D)

          (2) the need for the sentence imposed-
               ...    (D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or
          vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in
          the most effective manner;….

18 U.S.C. §3553(a)(2)(D). In this case, there are limits on the discretion this Court an

exercise, because the second count mandates a consecutive five year sentence. The

defense submits that for this defendant, five years is more than enough to provide the

defendant with the kinds of assistance outlined in this section of the statute. Whatever

correctional guidance can be provided by the penal system will be more that fulfilled with

a sentence of 5 years incarceration.

       IV.     CONCLUSION

       For all of the reasons set forth above, the defense asks for a sentence outside of

the guideline range pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §3553(a) as set forth above and more

specifically that the Court impose no prison term for the conviction on Count 1, in light

of the fact that the defendant will receive a sentence of at least five years on Count 2.
