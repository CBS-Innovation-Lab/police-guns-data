                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE




United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 05-cr-268-PB

Hugh Reynolds

                                  O R D E R


     The defendant has moved to continue the May 2, 2006 trial in

the above case, citing a negotiated plea agreement and the need

for additional time to finalize the plea.           The government does

not object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, in order to allow the parties additional time

to finalize a plea agreement or prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from May 2, 2006 to September 6, 2006.                In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.

     The April 19, 2006 final pretrial is continued to August 30,

2006 at 3:00 p.m.
