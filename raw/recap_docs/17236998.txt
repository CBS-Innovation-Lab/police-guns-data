                         ORDER AFFIRMING THE
              RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE


       The United States Magistrate Judge filed with the Court on January 25, 2007, his

Recommended Decision (Docket No. 43). Defendant Christopher Poulos filed his Objection to the

Recommended Decision (Docket No. 44) on February 11, 2007. The Government filed its response

to Defendant Poulos’s Objection (Docket No. 46) on February 26, 2007.

       I have reviewed and considered the Magistrate Judge's Recommended Decision, together

with the entire record; I have made a de novo determination of all matters adjudicated by the

Magistrate Judge's Recommended Decision; and I concur with the recommendations of the United

States Magistrate Judge for the reasons set forth in his Recommended Decision, and determine that

no further proceeding is necessary.

       1.      It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the Magistrate Judge
               is hereby AFFIRMED.
