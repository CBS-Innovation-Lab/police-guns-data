ASSENTED TO MOTION FOR A CONTINUANCE

The United States of America, by and through the undersigned

attorneys, hereby moves for a continuance of the sentencing date

in this matter for a period of 180 days from this date.

Defendantâ€™s sentencing is currently scheduled for June 27, 2007.

In support of its motion, the government states that the
defendant's plea agreement requires the defendant to cooperate
with the United States. lt is anticipated that the defendant
will testify in the case United States v. Arthur Gianelli, et
alLL Crim. No OB-lOOOB-NMG, a thirteen defendant racketeering
case. Currently, this matter is in the final stages of
discovery. However, it is unlikely that it will be resolved
within the next six months. The defendant assents to a
continuance of his sentencing for the reasons set forth above.

Respectfully submitted,

MICHAEL J. SULLIVAN
United States Attorney
