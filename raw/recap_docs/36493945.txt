                  IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO


UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

     Plaintiff,

                  v.                      Criminal No. 17-167 (FAB)
FREDDIE FUENTES-MORENO [3],

     Defendant.



                             MEMORANDUM AND ORDER


BESOSA, District Judge.

     Defendant     Freddie      Fuentes-Moreno   (“Fuentes”)   moves   to

withdraw his guilty plea.        (Docket No. 119.)   For the reasons set

forth below, the Court DENIES Fuentes’s motion.

I.   Background

     On February 4, 2017, Fuentes, José Cabret-Pacheo, Emilio José

Soto-Maldonado,        and      Luis    Ramos-Marrero     (collectively,

“defendants”) robbed a Puma gasoline station and an El Económico

supermarket.     (Docket Nos. 101, 102, 113 and 116.)     Subsequently,

a federal grand jury returned a second superseding indictment

charging the defendants with two counts of robbery in violation of

18 U.S.C. § 1951, two counts of brandishing a firearm during and

in relation to a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C.

§ 924(c)(1)(A)(ii), and one count of possessing a firearm and

ammunition after being convicted of a crime punishable by a term
Criminal No. 17-167 (FAB)                                                            2

of imprisonment exceeding one year in violation of 18 U.S.C.

§ 922(g)(1).     (Docket No. 65.) 1

       Fuentes and the United States entered into a plea agreement

on June 11, 2018.        (Docket No. 114.)         The next day, Fuentes pled

guilty to both robbery counts of the second superseding indictment.

Id. at pp. 1—2; Docket No. 113.         The United States moved to dismiss

the remaining firearm-related counts.               (Docket No. 113.)            As of

this   date,   all    defendants     have   pled    guilty     and   are   awaiting

sentencing.     (Docket Nos. 101, 102, 113 and 116.)

       Fuentes seeks to withdraw his guilty plea for two reasons.

(Docket No. 119.)        First, Fuentes asserts that the deadline to

request   a    change    of   plea   pressured      him   to   accept      the    plea

agreement.      Id.     Second, Fuentes challenges the plea agreement

because the stipulation of facts refers to his codefendants.                       Id.

The arguments set forth by Fuentes are unavailing.

II.    Discussion

       Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 (“Rule 11”) permits a

defendant to withdraw a guilty plea after the Court accepts the

plea, but prior to sentencing, if he or she “can show a fair and

just reason for requesting the withdrawal.”                    Fed. R. Crim. P.



1 The grand jury returned the indictment the superseding indictment on March 9,
2017 and November 14, 2017, respectively. (Docket Nos. 3 and 36.) Defendant
Soto-Maldonado was charged with one of the robbery counts, and was not charged
as a felon in possession of a firearm.
Criminal No. 17-167 (FAB)                                                          3

11(d)(2)(B).       “[A] defendant does not have an automatic right to

withdraw a plea [prior to sentencing].”                United States v. Pagán-

Ortega, 372 F.3d 22, 28 (1st Cir. 2004).                      Pleas entered in

accordance with Rule 11 “create an extremely heavy burden for a

defendant to overcome.”          United States v. Fernández-Santos, 126 F.

Supp. 3d 160, 164 (D.P.R. 2015) (Besosa, J.) (citation omitted).

      To determine whether withdrawal of a defendant’s guilty plea

is   fair    and   just,      courts    consider:      “whether   the   plea     was

voluntary, intelligent, knowing and in compliance with Rule 11;

the strength of the reasons offered in support of the motion;

whether there is a serious claim of actual innocence; the timing

of   the    motion;     and   any    prejudice    to   the   government    if    the

withdrawal is allowed.”             United States v. Isom, 580 F.3d 43, 52

(1st Cir. 2009) (citing United States v. Padilla-Galarza, 351 F.3d

594, 597 (1st Cir. 2003).            No one factor is dispositive.         Id.

      A.     No Fair and Just Reason Supports the Withdrawal of
             Fuentes’s Guilty Plea

             At the change of plea hearing, Fuentes “was advised of

the maximum penalties he [faced], his constitutional rights, the

consequences       of   waiving        his   constitutional    rights     and    the

applicable statutory guidelines.”                (Docket No. 116.)         Fuentes

“understood the charges against him and the spectrum of possible

penalties to which an admission of guilt [would] expose him.” Id.;
Criminal No. 17-167 (FAB)                                                                 4

United States v. Jiménez, 512 F.3d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir. 2007) (noting

that   “[a]    defendant’s        acknowledgment,         during    a    change-of-plea

proceeding,     that     he      understands       a    lucid    explanation      of   his

potential sentencing exposure is powerful evidence of the knowing

nature of his guilty plea”).              Accordingly, the representations

Fuentes made to the Court during his change of plea hearing

demonstrate that his guilty plea was voluntary, intelligent and

knowing.      He does not dispute this proposition.

              Fuentes    nonetheless      argues         that    because    the   United

States tendered its final plea offer the night before the deadline

for change of plea motions, he had only the day of the change of

plea hearing to review the plea agreement.                       (Docket No. 119 at

p. 1.)     Time      constraints,      however,         are   inherent     in   all    plea

negotiations between the United States and criminal defendants.

Indeed, “the strategic decision to plead guilty [is] not rendered

involuntary     by    the     anxieties      and       time   pressures     confronting

[defendants] . . . and hardly exceptional enough to evince an

overbearing of [his or her] will or . . . [to] preclude[] a rational

assessment of the available options.”                    United States v. Marrero-

Rivera, 124 F.3d 342, 350 (1st Cir. 1997) (affirming denial of

defendant’s     motion      to    withdraw     his      guilty    plea    “even   though

[defendant] was still inclined to go to trial within an hour or so

before the deadline for changing his plea”) (internal quotation
Criminal No. 17-167 (FAB)                                                     5

omitted); citing United States v. Muriel, 111 F.3d 975, 981 (1st

Cir. 1997) (“This court has not allowed defendants, absent coercion

or mistake, to renege on a plea agreement on the basis that they

have miscalculated their risks and benefits or have belatedly

discovered   a   new    defense.”).     No   statute,   rule   or   precedent

precludes the United States from imposing deadlines on defendants

in the context of plea negotiations.         Tellingly, although Fuentes

maintains that he felt “pressured,” he sets forth no claim that

the United States exerted coercion or overcame his will.             (Docket

No. 119.)      Accordingly, any stress that Fuentes experienced in

connection with negotiating a plea agreement cannot form a valid

basis for withdrawing his guilty plea.

            Fuentes’s    argument     pertaining   to   the   stipulation    of

facts in his plea agreement is equally unpersuasive.             (Docket No.

119.)   Citing no authority, Fuentes claims that withdrawal of his

guilty plea is proper because the names of his codefendants appear

in the stipulation of facts.        Id. at p. 2.    Fuentes proposes that

the parties amend the plea agreement to replace “co-defendants”

with “others,” because fellow “inmates interpret the language of

the plea agreement as one of someone who has cooperated with the

government.”     Id. at p. 2.       The Court will not allow Fuentes to

withdraw his plea agreement because he surmises that others may

identify him as someone who is cooperating with authorities.                The
Criminal No. 17-167 (FAB)                                           6

names of his co-defendants do not appear in the stipulation of

facts.   If Fuentes is concerned that other inmates may believe he

cooperated with the government (which he didn’t), he must raise

this concern with the appropriate authorities.      Because Fuentes

presents no fair or just reason to withdraw his guilty plea, his

motion is DENIED.

II.   CONCLUSION

      For the reasons set forth above, Fuentes’s motion to withdraw

his guilty plea is DENIED.    (Docket No. 119.)   Sentencing remains

set for September 11, 2018.

      IT IS SO ORDERED.
