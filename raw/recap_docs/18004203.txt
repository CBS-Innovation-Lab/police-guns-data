    ORDER ON MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF DETENTION ORDER

         The Court has before it the Defendant’s Motion for Reconsideration (ECF No.

105) requesting reconsideration of the January 23, 2015 Order denying Defendant’s

Motion for Review of Detention Order (ECF No. 83). The January 23, 2015 Order

affirmed the decision of a Magistrate Judge in the Middle District of Florida who

detained the Defendant pending trial. Florida Detention Order (ECF No. 74-3). In

support of his Motion for Reconsideration, the Defendant proffers additional evidence

much of which was available but not offered at his September 26, 2014 detention

hearing, which took place in Florida. On March 31, 2015, the Government filed a

response objecting to reconsideration. Opp. to Mot. for Reconsideration (ECF No.

140). On April 13, 2015, the Defendant filed a supplemental Motion for

Reconsideration, asserting as additional grounds for release the additional month-

long delay occasioned, he asserts, by the Government’s use of inadvertently disclosed

information as to the identity of two of Defendant’s witnesses. 1 Supplement to Mot.


1       The Government’s actions with regard to contacting the Defendant’s witnesses are not relevant
to the detention issues raised in this motion.

for Reconsideration (ECF No. 174). The Government filed a Response in Opposition

on April 17, 2015. Opp. to Renewed Mot. for Reconsideration (ECF No. 177).

      I have reviewed the Defendant’s request for reconsideration, and I have

listened to the tape recordings provided by defense counsel. The Defendant

essentially asserts that were he allowed to present additional evidence, he would be

able to establish that he did not violate a condition of release that required him to

avoid all contact, direct or indirect, with a witness in the case identified as JR. The

Defendant’s proffered information indicates that all contacts made from the

Defendant’s cell phone to JR were made by others. The Defendant indicates that: 1)

the Defendant’s daughter Teya had several telephone calls and text message

exchanges with JR about retrieving the Defendant’s belongings; 2) contacts occurring

when he was in Texas between his phone and JR were made by a disgruntled friend,

RB; and 3) the Defendant’s father used the Defendant’s phone to contact JR for

various reasons having to do with the Defendant’s personal property or his bank

account.

      The Magistrate Judge based his decision to detain in part on the substantial

number of contacts. Between August 7, 2014 and September 18, 2014, the

Defendant’s phone contacted JR’s phone 76 times and sent 821 text messages to JR’s

phone. Order on Def.’s Mot. for Review of Detention Order at 4. The Magistrate Judge

was aware that the Defendant’s father had contacted JR using the Defendant’s phone

and also understood the RB could have been using the phone.2 The only information


2     In the Florida detention hearing the Magistrate Judge stated:

not before the Magistrate Judge was Teya’s testimony that she also had several

telephone calls and text message exchanges with JR. This additional evidence is not

sufficient to upset the finding by clear and convincing evidence that the Defendant

violated the no contact order. Even assuming that all of the contacts with JR were

made by others, it appears from the Defendant’s own version of the events that the

Defendant’s daughter and father were contacting JR on the Defendant’s behalf.

Indirect contacts of this nature violated the conditions of release.

                                         CONCLUSION

        The Motion for Reconsideration (ECF No.105) and Supplement to the Motion

for Reconsideration (ECF No. 174) are GRANTED to the extent that the Court has

considered the additional evidence proffered by the Defendant. For the reasons stated

above, the Court AFFIRMS its earlier order regarding detention. The request for an

evidentiary hearing is DENIED.

       SO ORDERED.

               And while some of the phone calls could be explained by Mr. Eustis' father
               using the phone, or some of the calls could be explained by R.B. using the
               phone, the calls in New Jersey, there are no explanations for. And I just don't
               think with the number of contacts, especially when Mr. Eustis, the defendant's
               father, said that it was -- I don't know, anywhere from three, four, seven, or
               ten times that there was contact, that -- that those can be explained. So I think
               there was just a blatant disregard by Mr. Eustis for that condition of release.
               And I believe [the condition] was an important one.

Tr. at 144 (ECF No. 82).
