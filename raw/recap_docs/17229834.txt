             DECISION AND ORDER ON GOVERNMENT’S MOTION
                       FOR SENTENCE REDUCTION


       Pre-Booker cases consistently held that in granting a prosecutor’s motion to

 reduce a prison sentence on account of the offender’s substantial assistance to the

 government after sentencing, the federal sentencing judge could not enlarge the

 reduction for factors unrelated to the assistance.     All those cases, however,

 applied a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure—Rule 35(b)—that explicitly required

 the reduction to “reflect” the substantial assistance or to be in “accord” with

 Sentencing Commission Guidelines and policy statements. As of December 1,

 2007, all that language has disappeared from the Rule. Now it reads simply that a

 “court may reduce a sentence if the defendant, after sentencing, provided

 substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person” (emphasis

 added). The Advisory Committee Note says that the Rule was changed in an effort

 to “conform[ ]” the Rule to the Supreme Court’s decision in Booker; it reports that

 the drafters removed the previous language “because it treats the guidelines as

 mandatory[;]” and it quotes a portion of Booker that said that other factors

 contained in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) (factors that do not relate to substantial

 assistance) could affect the sentence as well.                I am unaware of any cases

 measuring the effect of the new language and Note. I write this opinion to explain

 why I conclude that on a Rule 35(b) motion, a district judge still cannot enlarge

 the sentence reduction for factors unrelated to substantial assistance. A different

 conclusion would place the new Rule beyond the authority conferred upon the

 rulemaking process under the Rules Enabling Act.1

                            I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY2

        Less than four months different in age, the teenaged defendant and his

 cousin (their fathers are brothers) were good friends who spent time together. On

 March 19, 2004, when the defendant was three months over age eighteen and his

 cousin was twenty-two days under, they constructed two homemade pipe bombs.

 Having together stolen pipe nipples with end caps from a Home Depot, having

 together bought black powder from a gun shop, and the cousin having bought

 timed hobby fuse over the internet, they built the bombs, exploded the first in an

 open field, and then after 10 p.m., exploded the second in a soda machine outside

 a truck stop after it closed. The cousin placed the second bomb and lit the fuse.

 Fortunately, no one was injured, but the soda machine was destroyed. Suspicion


 1 I welcome an appeal for a more definitive ruling from the Circuit because, although I invited the
 parties’ attention to the new Rule, the issue deserves more detailed briefing and argument. For
 that reason, care should be exercised in assessing the impact of this decision on the impending
 sentence reduction proceedings in crack cocaine cases when the new crack cocaine guideline
 becomes retroactive March 3, 2008. (In addition, although both proceedings require interpretation
 of 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c), they involve different subsections and text.)

 settled on the defendant because he had tried to buy a large quantity of

 ammonium nitrate at a Farmers Union store. As a result of a consensual search

 and a confession, authorities had enough evidence to prosecute him federally on

 the charges of possession of an unregistered destructive device, 26 U.S.C.

 §§ 5861(d), and malicious damage or destruction of property by means of an

 explosive, 18 U.S.C. § 844(i). The defendant was arrested and bailed in April

 2004, but not indicted until August 2005. Then he refused to cooperate and lied

 at a suppression hearing (as did his parents) to try to establish (unsuccessfully)

 that he did not confess voluntarily.            A jury convicted him.         The mandatory

 minimum sentence was five years. On December 15, 2006, I sentenced him at the

 bottom of the Guidelines range, sixty-three months. In considering the § 3553(a)

 factors, I concluded that the extra three months were necessary to reflect an

 appropriate small additional penalty for obstructing justice by lying. I remanded

 him immediately to custody.

        Federal authorities did not have enough evidence to convict the cousin

 without the defendant’s testimony. Once the defendant had been convicted, the

 government filed a juvenile information against the cousin (although he was by

 then just days shy of his twenty-first birthday, at which time he could have been

 prosecuted as an adult3), and obtained a court order compelling the defendant to



 government in its letter in support of the Rule 35(b) motion and at the motion hearing.
 3 The Juvenile Delinquency Act, 18 U.S.C. § 5031 et seq., does not apply to a defendant who is
 alleged to have committed a crime before his eighteenth birthday but is not prosecuted until after
 he turns twenty-one, unless the defendant can show that the government improperly delayed
 prosecution in order to gain a tactical advantage. See United States v. Jimenez, 256 F.3d 330, 345
 n.19 (5th Cir. 2001) (listing cases); United States v. Hoo, 825 F.2d 667, 669-70 (2d Cir. 1987).
 Here, there is no indication that the government delayed improperly. When the government filed

 testify against him. With a new lawyer, the defendant decided to cooperate. He

 agreed to withdraw his appeal of his conviction, his sentence, and the denial of his

 suppression motion; and he made a proffer. Because of the defendant’s proffer,

 his cousin consented to disposition as a juvenile delinquent (the equivalent of a

 guilty plea), resulting in a serious rift in the extended family of the two young men.

 A different judge for a variety of reasons (including the limitations imposed by

 juvenile proceedings) sentenced the cousin to a drastically shorter period of

 confinement.

        Now the government has moved under Rule 35(b) to reduce the defendant’s

 sentence below both the statutory minimum and the Guidelines range. Initially,

 the government said in a written submission that I should reduce his sentence to

 forty-eight months considering his substantial assistance alone. The government

 explained that even with the twenty-five percent reduction it recommended, the

 defendant’s sentence of forty-eight months would still be sixteen times longer than

 the sentence his cousin received. Then at the hearing, the prosecutor agreed that

 under the new Rule language, it would be appropriate to consider other factors,

 particularly sentencing disparity. The defendant requested that I consider all the

 § 3553(a) factors and grant him a substantially lower (but unspecified) sentence.

 In a written memorandum filed after the hearing, the government’s position has

 become more opaque.4


 the juvenile information, the defendant in this case had not yet agreed to cooperate against his
 cousin, and the government had not yet obtained a compulsion order compelling the defendant to
 testify against his cousin. In fact, the defendant did not proffer until several months after his
 cousin turned twenty-one.
 4 It says: “Thus, while the Court may consider 3553(a) factors in reducing Defendant’s sentence, it

                                            II. ANALYSIS

        I start with some history.

                                     A. Rule 35(b) Pre-Booker

        Before the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 created the Sentencing

 Commission and directed the writing of the Guidelines, Rule 35 gave district

 judges wide discretion to reduce a previously imposed sentence, provided that

 they acted within certain time limits.5 According to the First Circuit, a Rule 35

 motion was a “plea for leniency” and was “committed to the informed discretion of

 the trial court.” United States v. Distasio, 820 F.2d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 1987).

 (1) Rule 35 as Amended by the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984

        But with the Sentencing Reform Act and its new and strict limitations on

 federal judges’ discretion in imposing sentences, Congress also introduced new

 limits on federal judges’ authority to reduce a sentence previously imposed. Under



 is the government’s position that it may do so only in determining to what extent to reduce the
 sentence based on Defendant’s cooperation.” Gov’t Mem. Regarding Mot. for Sentence Reduction
 at 2 (Docket Item 154). On their face, the § 3553(a) factors do not seem to relate to cooperation.
 But the language is similar to what § 3582(c)(2) contains for considering reduced sentences in the
 case of a Guidelines amendment: “[T]he court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after
 considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable . . . .” The
 same language appears in § 3582(c)(1)(A), authorizing reductions based upon Bureau of Prisons
 motions. Perhaps the government means to say that I can use the § 3553(a) factors in deciding not
 to reduce or to reduce by a smaller amount, but that I cannot use them to increase a reduction.
 That would be similar to the earlier caselaw mentioned in note 10 infra (it is how I ultimately
 interpret the Rule language).
 5 Before the Sentencing Reform Act amendments took effect, Rule 35(b) provided:

                 A motion to reduce a sentence may be made, or the court may
                 reduce a sentence without motion, within 120 days after the
                 sentence is imposed or probation revoked, or within 120 days after
                 receipt by the court of a mandate issued upon affirmance of the
                 judgment or dismissal of the appeal, or within 120 days after entry
                 of any order or judgment of the Supreme Court denying review of, or
                 having the effect of upholding, a judgment of conviction or probation
                 revocation.    The court shall determine the motion within a
                 reasonable time. Changing a sentence from incarceration to a grant
                 of probation shall constitute a permissible reduction of sentence

 subchapter D, captioned “Imprisonment”, Congress adopted what is now 18

 U.S.C. § 3582, a section that distinguishes between imposing a term of

 imprisonment (subsection (a)), and modifying a term of imprisonment previously

 imposed (subsection (c)).

        In subsection (c), Congress recognized three basic categories of modification

 (reduction) for sentences previously imposed.6 One category is reduction on

 motion by the Bureau of Prisons, seeking a prisoner’s early release, generally on

 account of age and/or severe illness. 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A). Another category

 is reduction because later Guidelines amendments have reduced the applicable

 sentencing range for an already sentenced offender. 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). For

 both these categories, Congress specified that the reductions must be “consistent

 with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.”

 § 3582(c)(1)(A), (c)(2). Third, as relevant to this case:

                The court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has
                been imposed except that—

                (1) in any case—
                ...
                       (B) the court may modify an imposed term of
                imprisonment to the extent otherwise expressly permitted by
                statute7 or by Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal
                Procedure . . . .

 as reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3304.
 7 An example of such a statute is 18 U.S.C. § 3559(c)(7), discussed in United States v. McClain, No.

 05-16015, 2006 WL 1785337 (11th Cir. June 29, 2006) (unpublished opinion). That statute
 authorizes resentencing in certain situations where a prior conviction produced a heightened
 sentence but that prior conviction later was overturned because it was unconstitutional or the
 defendant was pardoned for innocence of that crime.

 Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-473, Title II, § 212(a)(2), 98 Stat.

 1837 (1984), codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c). When it enacted this provision,

 Congress simultaneously rewrote Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal

 Procedure to contain an express provision concerning the extent of the permitted

 modification and the Sentencing Commission’s role. Rule 35(b) as rewritten by

 Congress took effect in 1987. It provided:

               The court, on motion of the Government, may within one year
               after the imposition of a sentence, lower a sentence to reflect a
               defendant’s subsequent, substantial assistance in the
               investigation or prosecution of another person who has
               committed an offense, in accordance with the guidelines and
               policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission
               pursuant to section 994 of title 28, United States Code. The
               court’s authority to lower a sentence under this subdivision
               includes the authority to lower such sentence to a level below
               that established by statute as a minimum sentence.

 Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Title II, § 212(b), as amended by Anti-Drug Abuse

 Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-570, Title X, § 1009, 100 Stat. 3207 (1986).8




 8 The language Congress originally adopted for Rule 35(b) in 1984 was slightly different. It
 provided:
                The court, on motion of the Government, may within one year after
                the imposition of a sentence, lower a sentence to reflect a
                defendant’s subsequent, substantial assistance in the investigation
                or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense, to
                the extent that such assistance is a factor in applicable guidelines or
                policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to
                28 U.S.C. 994(a).
 Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Title II, § 212(b). But before the new Rule 35(b) took effect in
 1987, Congress changed the text by replacing the language after the final comma. At the same
 time, Congress adopted 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e), the provision authorizing a court, upon government
 motion, to reduce a sentence below a statutory minimum at the initial imposition of sentence. See
 Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, Title X, § 1007. The addition of the final sentence in Rule 35(b)
 provides parallel authority after sentencing.
        In the same legislation, Congress also directed the Commission to write a policy statement
 for granting downward departures based upon substantial assistance at the time of sentence
 imposition. See Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, Title X, § 1008, codified at 28 U.S.C. § 994(n). The
 Commission drafted § 5K1.1 as a result.


                                                                                                7
Case 2:05-cr-00069-DBH Document 158 Filed 02/04/08 Page 8 of 33                        PageID #: 1233



        The language of § 3582(c), along with congressionally-written Rule 35(b),

 shows that Congress expected the Commission to write a Guideline or policy

 statement for all three post-sentence reduction categories. In fact, Congress

 specifically directed the Commission to promulgate general policy statements for

 “the sentence modification provisions set forth in section[ ] . . . 3582(c) of title 18.”

 28 U.S.C. § 994(a)(2)(C). Nowhere is there a suggestion that these “sentence

 modification provisions” are the same as initial sentence imposition and that

 Congress contemplated an entirely new resentencing with full reconsideration of

 everything involved.9

 (2) Implementation of Rule 35(b) as amended by the Sentencing Reform Act

        In response to the statute, the Commission has written a policy statement

 for Bureau of Prisons motions, USSG § 1B1.13; it has written a policy statement

 for Guidelines amendments that reduce the sentencing range, USSG § 1B1.10; it

 has even written a policy statement that governs substantial assistance rendered

 before the judge initially imposes a sentence, USSG § 5K1.1. But despite the

 congressional directive, the Commission has never written a policy statement

 specifically for Rule 35(b)/§ 3582(c)(1)(B) substantial assistance motions to reduce

 a sentence previously imposed.




 9Cf. United States v. McAndrews, 12 F.3d 273, 277 (1st Cir. 1993) (“By definition, a sentence must
 already have been imposed before Rule 35(b) can be invoked and a sentence reduction
 contemplated. It follows that the appealability of an order resolving a Rule 35(b) motion is not
 controlled by 18 U.S.C. § 3742 because such an order is not, properly speaking, a sentence.”). See
 also Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(a)(3), (a)(4) (the defendant’s presence is required at the original sentencing
 but not at a Rule 35 proceeding); Advisory Committee’s Note, 1998 Amendments (distinguishing
 between a resentencing on remand and a sentence reduction proceeding).


                                                                                                      8

        Nevertheless, courts confronted with Rule 35(b) motions under the

 Guidelines sentencing regime soon decided that although judges could consider a

 variety of factors in refusing to reduce a sentence or in refusing to reduce it as

 much as the substantial assistance alone might have justified,10 they could

 consider only substantial assistance (and not other factors) in support of a

 reduction. There were two reasons. First, the statute and the Rule said that the

 reduction must “reflect” the “subsequent, substantial assistance,” United States v.

 Chavarria-Herrara, 15 F.3d 1033, 1037 (11th Cir. 1994) (“The plain language of

 Rule 35(b) indicates that the reduction shall reflect the assistance of the

 defendant; it does not mention any other factor that may be considered.”); United

 States v. Garcia, 215 Fed. App’x. 948 (11th Cir. 2007) (same); United States v.

 Manella, 86 F.3d 201 (11th Cir. 1996) (same). Second, courts began to treat

 § 5K1.1 (for reductions at the time of initial sentence imposition) as pertinent to

 Rule 35(b) post-sentence reductions, and the § 5K1.1 decisions routinely held that

 only factors related to substantial assistance could be considered in supporting a

 downward reduction. See, e.g., United States v. Chestna, 962 F.2d 103, 106-07

 (1st Cir. 1992).11 The courts therefore applied that same limitation to Rule 35(b)


 10 See, e.g., United States v. Neary, 183 F.3d 1196, 197-98 (10th Cir. 1999); United States v.
 Manella, 86 F.3d 201, 204-05 (11th Cir. 1996). This asymmetry results from the fact that the Rule
 says the court “may” (not must) reduce the sentence for substantial assistance, combined with the
 absence of any language “in the text of the rule [that] purports to limit what factors may militate
 against granting a Rule 35(b) reduction.” Manella, 86 F.3d at 204-05. See also United States v.
 Woodward, No. 07-4125, 2007 WL 2404444 (4th Cir. Aug. 23, 2007); United States v. Doe, 351
 F.3d 929 (9th Cir. 2003).
 11 The courts have applied the same reasoning to government motions to go below a statutory

 minimum sentence at the time of imposing sentence under the authority of § 3553(e). Subsection
 (e) states:
                 Upon motion of the Government, the court shall have the authority
                 to impose a sentence below a level established by statute as a

 reductions. See, e.g., United States v. Woodward, 245 Fed. App’x 320 (4th Cir.

 2007) (citing a § 5K1.1 decision); Garcia, 215 Fed. App’x. at 950 (same); United

 States v. Momoh, No. 95-1674, 1996 WL 289988, *2 (2d Cir. May 31, 1996)

 (unpublished opinion) (citing § 5K1.1 directly); United States v. Doe, 940 F.2d 199,

 203 n.7 (7th Cir. 1991) (same).12 Indeed, the First Circuit has called the two

 provisions “birds of a feather.” United States v. Alegria, 192 F.3d 179, 184 (1st

 Cir. 1999). Practically speaking, then, § 5K1.1 and its listing of factors became

 the de facto policy statement for Rule 35(b).13 See United States v. Marks, 244

 F.3d 971, 973 n.1 (8th Cir. 2001) (listing cases).

                  assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who
                  has committed an offense. Such sentence shall be imposed in
                  accordance with the guidelines and policy statements issued by the
                  Sentencing Commission pursuant to section 994 of title 28, United
                  States Code.
 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e). Once again, the statutory command that the reduction below the statutory
 minimum must “reflect” the substantial assistance has driven the interpretation. See United
 States v. Ahlers, 305 F.3d 54, 60 (1st Cir. 2002). In addition, for § 3553(e) motions, § 5K1.1
 explicitly applies. See USSG § 5K1.1, comment. (n.1).
 12 There was some early, more careful language. See, e.g., United States v. Gangi, 45 F.3d 28, 31

 (2d Cir. 1995) (“We are persuaded that, due to similarity of language and function, § 5K1.1 should
 inform our construction of Rule 35(b).”); United States v. Perez, 955 F.2d 34, 35 (10th Cir. 1992)
 (“Because of their overlapping subject matter and similarities in language, it is instructive to
 examine and compare U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1 (policy statement) and 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e) (1988) when
 interpreting Rule 35(b).”).
 13 Textually, it is apparent that § 5K1.1 is not a policy statement for Rule 35(b) motions. The

 Commission has been explicit when it issues policy statements that apply to post-sentence
 reductions. See, e.g., USSG § 1B1.10 (reducing previously imposed sentences because of a
 retroactive Guideline change), USSG § 1B1.13 (reducing a previously imposed sentence because of
 a Bureau of Prisons motion). Section 5K1.1, on the other hand, contains no reference to post-
 sentence reductions and appears in a section of the Guidelines—Chapter 5, Part K—that otherwise
 contains provisions that can apply only at the time of initial sentence imposition. The Commentary
 to § 5K1.1 refers to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e) and 28 U.S.C. § 994(n), both of which are concerned with
 sentence imposition. It makes no reference to § 3582(c) or Rule 35(b). And there is, of course, at
 least one significant difference between the two: § 5K1.1 is concerned with the timeliness of a
 decision to assist. By definition, Rule 35(b) can apply only when substantial assistance is late—
 i.e., after sentencing, and then generally only within the first year. The timeliness factor of § 5K1.1
 thus is a poor fit for the one-year window of Rule 35(b). It is perhaps not surprising that
 generating a policy statement for Rule 35(b) has not been a high priority. Rule 35(b) motions
 represent a very small proportion of sentencing events. See Linda Drazga Maxfield & John H.

        In 2002, the Rules drafters amended Rule 35(b) “as part of the general

 restyling of the Criminal Rules . . . . These changes [were] intended to be stylistic

 only[.]” Fed. R. Crim. P. 35 Advisory Committee’s Note, 2002 Amendments. They

 removed the “reflect” language and modified slightly the reference to the

 Sentencing Commission. The Rule, as amended, required that “reducing the

 sentence accord[ ] with the Sentencing Commission’s Guidelines and policy

 statements.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(b)(1)(B) (effective Dec. 1, 2002). But the cases

 interpreting the Rule did not change; they continued to refer to the Commission’s

 § 5K1.1 factors and to limit district judges to considering only those assistance-

 related factors. See, e.g., Woodward, 245 Fed App’x at 323; Garcia, 215 Fed.

 Appx. at 950-51.

                                 B. Rule 35(b) Post-Booker

        The January 2005 Supreme Court decision in Booker was a watershed for

 Federal Guidelines sentencing. Booker ruled that the Sixth Amendment right to

 jury trial prevents judicially-found facts (except the existence of previous

 convictions) from mandating a higher sentence. United States v. Booker, 543 U.S.

 220, 226-27, 245 (2005). As a result of Booker, Federal Sentencing Guidelines

 that had been mandatory became advisory. Id. at 245. Rule 35(b)(1) proceedings,

 however, did not change.          Courts continued to insist that only substantial

 assistance factors could support a post-sentence reduction on a Rule 35(b)

 motion, and that § 3553(a) factors could not enhance the reduction. United States


 and Practice, 5 n.11 (January 1998) available at http://www.ussc.gov/ (as of 10 years ago, about
 500 Rule 35(b) reductions occurred per year compared with about 7,500 § 5K1.1 departures). And
 the § 5K1.1 factors do give general guidance.

 v. White No. 06-15155, 2007 WL 3047253 (11th Cir. Oct. 19, 2007); United States

 v. Budd, 208 Fed. App’x. 271, 272 (4th Cir. 2006).

 (1) The Rules Committee’s Response to Booker

       Nevertheless, after Booker, the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules began

 to debate the decision’s effect on Rule 35(b).14 I have already described the Rules

 drafters’ previous elimination of the “reflect” requirement that they described as a

 purely stylistic change. Effective December 1, 2007, they also deleted entirely the

 language in Rule 35(b) that referred to the Sentencing Commission, its Guidelines

 or policy statements. Now, that portion of Rule 35(b) says only:

             Upon the government’s motion made within one year of
             sentencing, the court may reduce a sentence if the defendant,
             after sentencing, provided substantial assistance in
             investigating or prosecuting another person.

 Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(b)(1) (effective Dec. 1, 2007) (emphasis added).

       To recapitulate, in § 3582(c) Congress authorized very limited circumstances

 in which a court could modify a term of imprisonment, including “to the extent

 otherwise expressly permitted by . . . Rule 35(b).” But the criteria that Congress

 originally wrote into Rule 35(b) to guide the authorized § 3582(c) modification have

 disappeared as a result of successive Rules amendments: first, deletion of the

 “reflect” language in a stylistic change; then, deletion of all reference to the

 Sentencing Commission’s role.

       According to the Advisory Committee Note accompanying the 2007

 Amendment, the Advisory Committee believed that the Supreme Court’s decision

 in Booker required the most recent change: “The amendment conforms Rule




                                                                                   12

 35(b)(1) to the Supreme Court’s decision in United States v. Booker . . . .

 Subdivision (b)(1)(B) has been deleted because it treats the guidelines as

 mandatory.”        Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(b) Advisory Committee’s Note, 2007

 Amendments. And the Advisory Committee apparently believed that a judge

 confronted with a Rule 35(b) motion to reduce a sentence may now consider the

 entire range of original sentencing factors under Booker: it explains, with a

 quotation from Booker, that with § 3553(b)(1) “severed and excised,” the

 Sentencing Reform Act “permits the court to tailor the sentence in light of other

 statutory concerns as well [as the Guidelines], see § 3553(a).”15 Because the

 Judicial Conference and the Supreme Court both approved the amendment and

 Congress did not intervene, the new version of Rule 35(b) is now effective.

        What then is the effect of the new language? As amended, Rule 35(b)(1)

 permits a post-sentence reduction if the government so moves and if there is

 substantial assistance.16 But the Rule no longer requires that any reduction

 “reflect” the substantial assistance or “accord” with Sentencing Commission

 policies or Guidelines. In other words, once the two conditions are satisfied (a


 14In an Appendix, I summarize the rulemaking process that ensued.
 15The Note states in full:
                The amendment conforms Rule 35(b)(1) to the Supreme Court’s
                decision in United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005). In Booker
                the Court held that the provision of the federal sentencing statute
                that makes the Guidelines mandatory, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1),
                violates the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial. With this provision
                severed and excised, the Court held, the Sentencing Reform Act
                “makes the Guidelines effectively advisory,” and “requires a
                sentencing court to consider Guidelines ranges, see 18 U.S.C.A.
                § 3553(a)(4) (Supp. 2004), but it permits the court to tailor the
                sentence in light of other statutory concerns as well, see § 3553(a)
                (Supp. 2004).” Id. at 245-46. Subdivision (b)(1)(B) has been deleted
                because it treats the guidelines as mandatory.

 government motion; and substantial assistance in investigating and prosecuting

 another person), the Rule has no express criteria either in its text, or through

 delegation to the Commission, for assessing the extent of any sentence reduction.

 The question is whether the rulemaking process could rewrite the Rule in this

 fashion.

 (2) Booker’s Applicability to Rule 35(b) Proceedings

        Obviously, the Advisory Committee could rewrite the Rule if the

 Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Booker, made the previous

 Rule language unconstitutional. In that event, the rulemaking process simply

 excised the unconstitutional part of the previous Rule.

        Certainly there are statements in Booker that could lead a reader to

 conclude that every mandatory feature of the Guidelines has been thrown out.17

 But it is important to read Booker’s statements carefully, in light of the issue the

 Supreme Court was deciding there. The Court was deciding whether a federal

 judge must increase the sentence to be imposed after a trial or a guilty plea, by


 16 Rule 35(b)(4) still permits a court to go below a statutory minimum sentence on such a motion.
 17 In the Booker remedial opinion, the Court stated that given the Court’s constitutional holding, a
 mandatory Guidelines system “is not a choice that remains open.” Booker, 543 U.S. at 265. It also
 rejected the government’s suggestion that the Guidelines system could be advisory when “the
 Guidelines would require the sentencing court to find a sentence-enhancing fact” but mandatory in
 all other cases―those in which the Constitution did not prohibit judicial factfinding. Booker, 543
 U.S. at 265-66. The Court explained that it did
                 not see how it is possible to leave the Guidelines as binding in
                 [these] other cases. For one thing, the Government’s proposal would
                 impose mandatory Guidelines-type limits upon a judge’s ability to
                 reduce sentences, but it would not impose those limits upon a
                 judge’s ability to increase sentences. We do not believe that such
                 ‘one-way lever[s]’ are compatible with Congress’ intent. For another,
                 we believe that Congress would not have authorized a mandatory
                 system in some cases and a non-mandatory system in others, given
                 the administrative complexities that such a system would create.

 taking into account facts that the jury had not found and that the defendant had

 not conceded. The Court was not dealing with (Booker does not even discuss)

 what the Sixth Amendment requires when the prosecutor asks a court to reduce

 an unchallenged sentence that was previously imposed on a convicted offender. It

 is hard to see what relevance the Sixth Amendment has in that context. Such

 sentence reductions after sentencing have never been the stuff of jury trials.18

        What Booker did was to excise as unconstitutional two very specific

 provisions of the statute:19 one dealing with appellate review (I will not discuss it,

 as it is not pertinent to this case) and § 3553(b)(1), a provision that made the

 Guidelines mandatory when imposing a sentence.                        Section 3553(b)(1) (the

 provision the Advisory Committee cited in the Note accompanying the recent

 amendment to Rule 35(b)), however, deals only with initial imposition of sentence,

 not with reduction of a previously imposed sentence.20 The separate topic of later


 18 The Ninth Circuit, in United States v. Hicks, held that Booker applies when a district court

 resentences a defendant pursuant to § 3582(c)(2), which authorizes a sentence reduction for a
 defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that was
 subsequently lowered retroactively by the Sentencing Commission. 472 F.3d 1167 (9th Cir. 2007).
 Under the Ninth Circuit’s reasoning, the judge lowering the initial sentence on account of the
 Guidelines amendment may reduce the sentence even farther by considering the § 3553(a) factors.
 Id. at 1170. The Fourth Circuit disagrees. See United States v. Hudson, 242 Fed. App’x. 16 (4th
 Cir. 2007). (In a different context, the Eleventh Circuit has said that “Booker is inapplicable to
 § 3582(c)(2) motions.” United States v. Moreno, 421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir. 2005). The Third
 Circuit has said that “section 3582(c)(2) does not entitle a defendant to a full de novo
 resentencing.” United States v. Swint, No. 07-1719, 2007 WL 2745767, at *2 n.1 (3d Cir. Sept. 21,
 2007).) It will be time enough to decide that issue in this District when the crack cocaine
 Guidelines reduction becomes effective March 3, 2008. I am satisfied that the Hicks argument,
 whatever its validity, does not include Rule 35(b) motions, see White, 2007 WL 3047253, at *1.
 19 “We answer the question of remedy by finding the provision of the federal sentencing statute that

 makes the Guidelines mandatory, 18 U.S.C.A. § 3553(b)(1) (Supp. IV), incompatible with today's
 constitutional holding. We conclude that this provision must be severed and excised, as must one
 other statutory section, § 3742(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), which depends upon the Guidelines'
 mandatory nature.” Booker, 543 U.S. at 245; id. at 246 (“severance and excision of two
 provisions”); id. at 259 (“[W]e must sever and excise two specific statutory provisions.”).

 sentence reduction is treated in § 3582(c), dealing with post-sentence motions from

 the Bureau of Prisons, substantial cooperation motions under Rule 35(b), and

 post-sentence reductions when the Commission lowers a Guidelines range (as it

 did with the recent crack cocaine amendment). In Booker, the Supreme Court

 said nothing about § 3582(c) or Rule 35. Moreover, the Court was careful to note

 that it “must ‘refrain from invalidating more of the statute than is necessary,’” and

 “must retain those portions of the Act that are (1) constitutionally valid,

 (2) capable of ‘functioning independently,’ and (3) consistent with Congress’ basic

 objectives in enacting the statute.” Booker, 543 U.S. at 258-59 (internal citations

 omitted).

        I conclude that the post-sentence structure created by § 3582(c)(1)(B)

 together with the previous language of Rule 35(b) meets those three criteria. It is

 constitutionally valid (it offends nothing in the Sixth Amendment or Booker); it is

 capable of functioning independently of the (previously mandatory) Guidelines

 governing sentence imposition; and it is consistent with Congress’ basic objectives

 in enacting the Sentencing Reform Act. In 1984 Congress severely limited judges’

 previous Rule 35 discretion to reduce an already imposed sentence, and certainly

 did so in part because it did not want general sentencing discretion to creep back

 in through the back door post-sentence. At the same time, Congress articulated a

 clear standard for post-sentence reductions, a standard that can function


        within the range, referred to in subsection (a)(4) unless the court finds that there exists an
        aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into
        consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should
        result in a sentence different from that described.
 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1).


                                                                                                   16

 independently of the rest of the Guidelines structure and that is consistent with

 Congress’ basic objective. The standard was that a post-sentence reduction must

 “reflect” the “subsequent, substantial assistance” that the offender provided. That

 standard serves the legitimate purposes of encouraging later substantial

 assistance from an offender without intruding unduly on sentencing finality21 and

 of avoiding additional complexity by foreclosing a re-evaluation of all sentencing

 issues under § 3553(a) whenever a Rule 35(b) motion is filed.22 Through the Rule

 language and through 28 U.S.C. § 994(a)(2)(C), Congress asked the Commission to

 elaborate on the “reflect” standard through Guidelines and policy statements.23 I

 see nothing in Booker to invalidate such a role for the Commission; instead, such

 a delegation was upheld in the Supreme Court’s earlier Mistretta decision. See

 Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 412 (1989). Thus, even though Booker

 has restored some discretion to the judge initially imposing the sentence, this

 post-sentence part of the statute, which limits a reduction so as to reflect the

 defendant’s substantial assistance, has no Sixth Amendment ramification, and


 21 The First Circuit has reflected on the importance of finality in the context of a retroactive
 Guidelines amendment. In United States v. Jordan, refusing to countenance reopening sentencing
 issues beyond the effect of the Guidelines amendment, it referred to “the strong interest in the
 finality of criminal judgments, a powerful policy interest expressed in many forms in the criminal
 law” and referred to 28 U.S.C. § 991(b)(1)(B)’s reference to “certainty” as well as “fairness” in
 sentencing. 162 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1998). Uncertainty about a sentence was one of the factors that
 motivated the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. Booker, 543 U.S. at 264; Mistretta v. United States,
 488 U.S. 361, 366, 374 (1989).
 22 At least two decisions post-Booker, but before the December 2007 amendment to Rule 35, ruled

 that a Rule 35(b) motion is narrow: it does not challenge the finality of the original sentence such
 that the defendant might invoke Booker, Budd, 208 Fed. App’x. at 272; and it is not a resentencing
 that permits correction of earlier errors. White, 2007 WL 3047253, at *1.
 23 One member of the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules resisted the necessity for any Rule

 35(b) change on the basis that there is no Commission Guideline or policy statement for Rule
 35(b). The Rule change went forward nevertheless, apparently on the fear that the Commission
 might create a binding standard in the future, and that the Rule would then run afoul of Booker.
 See Appendix.


                                                                                                  17

 can function independently of those statutory provisions that do implicate the

 Sixth Amendment.24

        Finally, even if Booker did destroy all mandatory features of the Guidelines,

 even for this post-sentence relief, then the Committee’s 2007 amendment, perhaps

 unintentionally, has turned the earlier 2002 “stylistic” amendment (removing

 “reflect”) into a substantive change, a change that I will discuss below under the

 Rules Enabling Act. With removal of even Commission standards from the Rule

 (operating now by analogy under § 5K1.1), “reflect” has become only “if.”

 Reading the amendment in light of the Rules Enabling Act

        If I am correct that Booker does not support the December 2007 change in

 Rule 35(b), and if the new Advisory Committee Note, taken at face value, means

 that a judge can now consider all the § 3553(a) factors in deciding how far to

 reduce a sentence on a Rule 35(b) motion, can the new Rule nevertheless be

 effective because of the independent authority of the rulemaking process? The

 answer to that question depends upon the scope of rulemaking authority under

 the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2072.

        The Rules Enabling Act allows the Supreme Court, following certain

 prescribed steps, “to prescribe general rules of practice and procedure . . . for

 cases in the United States district courts.” 28 US.C. § 2072(a). A duly adopted

 rule that satisfies the Rules Enabling Act supplants a pre-existing statute, and


 24 It is not like the “one-way lever[s]” at initial sentence imposition that concerned the Court in
 Booker, 543 U.S. at 266, by which the Guidelines would control reductions but not increases in
 calculating the original sentence. A Rule 35(b) proceeding has always dealt solely with reductions.
 Applying Booker’s standard for the remedial question (What result adheres most closely to
 Congress’ original objective? Id. at 263), I conclude that the statutorily-assigned role for the
 (continued on next page)

                                                                                                 18

 thus would supplant the congressionally-adopted Rule 35(b).25 But the statute

 also provides that “[s]uch rules shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any

 substantive right.” 28 U.S.C. § 2072(b). According to Supreme Court cases that

 every law student reads in first year Civil Procedure,26 “[t]he test must be whether

 a rule really regulates procedure,―the judicial process for enforcing rights and

 duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and

 redress for disregard or infraction of them.” Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U.S. 1,

 14 (1941), discussed in Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 386-88; Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S.

 460 (1965).27 Is removing the Sentencing Commission’s role altogether in Rule

 35(b) motions a matter of procedure? Hardly. Instead, it moves control of the

 factors to be considered from the Commission to the courts. According to Booker,

 Mistretta “was premised on the understanding that the Commission . . . makes

 political and substantive decisions.” 543 U.S. at 242.28 And the combined effect

 of replacing “reflect” with “if,” along with eliminating the Commission’s role,



 Commission remains.
 25 “All laws in conflict with such rules shall be of no further force or effect after such rules have
 taken effect.” 28 U.S.C. § 2072(b); see Davis v. United States, 411 U.S. 233, 241-42 (1973).
 26 In 1988, Congress unified the criminal and civil rule-making authority under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2071-

 2077. Before this consolidation, the Supreme Court’s authority to prescribe rules of criminal
 practice and procedure was governed by 18 U.S.C. §§ 3771 (process prior to a verdict or guilty plea)
 and 3772 (post verdict process) (repealed Pub. L. No. 100-702, Title IV, § 404(a)(1), Nov. 19, 1988,
 102 Stat. 4642, 4651).
 27 The same analysis applies to Rules of Criminal Procedure. See United States v. Walsh, 75 F.3d

 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1996).
 28 In upholding the delegation of authority to the Sentencing Commission in Mistretta, the

 Supreme Court was “loath to enter the logical morass of distinguishing between substantive and
 procedural rules,” but “recognize[d] that the task of promulgating rules regulating practice and
 pleading before federal courts does not involve the degree of political judgment integral to the
 Commission’s formulation of sentencing guidelines.” Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 392. The Court
 pointed out that the Commission must make judgments about things like the circumstances of the
 offense, community views of its gravity, and deterrence. Id. at n.18. “[T]he degree of political
 judgment about crime and criminality exercised by the Commission and the scope of the
 substantive effects of its work does to some extent set its rulemaking powers apart from prior

 amounts to changing—indeed removing—the standard for the amount or degree of

 post-sentence reduction.          That is substantive, not procedural, under any

 definition of those terms.

        I hesitate to reach a conclusion that the Rules drafters exceeded their

 authority. After all, the treatise writers tell us that the Supreme Court has never

 invalidated a rule as contrary to the Rules Enabling Act, and that when the

 question is close, courts typically interpret a rule so as to avoid the issue. 1 James

 Wm. Moore et al., Moore’s Federal Practice § 1.05[2][a] (3d ed. 2006); see also Sara

 Sun Beale, Reconsidering Supervisory Power in Criminal Cases: Constitutional

 and Statutory Limits on the Authority of the Federal Courts, 84 Colum. L. Rev.

 1433, 1477 (1984). So first I determine whether I can reasonably interpret the

 new Rule language to avoid the problem.

        The new text of the Rule itself provides no express standard for granting a

 reduction once the court concludes that a sentenced offender has given

 substantial assistance. The text now tells the judge only if the reduction can take

 place. As the Appendix shows, the Reporter to the Advisory Committee suggested

 including a statement in the Note that the Committee intended no change in the

 standard. Unfortunately, her suggestion was not adopted. Nevertheless, it is only

 the Advisory Committee Note that suggests that the drafters expected judges to

 consider the § 3553(a) factors on such a motion, factors that include sentencing

 disparity, the need to provide restitution, etc.




 judicial rulemaking.” Id. at 392-93.


                                                                                    20

        “But the Advisory Committee Note is not the law; the rule is.” United States

 v. Carey, 120 F.3d 509, 512 (4th Cir. 1997). Appellate caselaw interpreted the

 previous text to allow only assistance-related factors to support the extent of a

 reduction even in the absence of binding Commission Guidelines or policy

 statements. The new text does not require me to ignore that caselaw. Indeed, it

 appears likely that, in its haste to remove binding Sentencing Commission

 authority, the Committee did not consider the effect of its previous “stylistic”

 amendment that removed the word “reflect.”

        I interpret the new Rule 35(b), therefore, to limit the judge, as before the

 amendment, to consider only substantial assistance factors in support of the

 amount of a reduction, notwithstanding the amendment and the Advisory

 Committee Note. I read the Rule as if the Advisory Committee, in excising all

 reference to the Commission, had reinserted Congress’ original requirement that

 the reduction “reflect” the “subsequent, substantial assistance.”29 Because the

 Commission has never written a policy statement for Rule 35(b) motions, it is

 premature to resolve finally the authority of the rulemaking process to eliminate

 the role that Congress assigned the Commission. It will be time enough to decide

 that issue when the Commission explicitly promulgates a Rule 35(b) policy

 statement. In the meantime, interpreting the text to limit reductions to factors



 29 As before, the § 3553(a) factors can be used in declining to reduce or in lessening the reduction
 that assistance would otherwise support. Garcia, 215 Fed. App’x. at 950-51 (citing Manella, 86
 F.3d at 204-05); Doe, 351 F.3d 929; United States v. Neary, 183 F.3d 1196 (10th Cir. 1999). I
 suppose this limitation on the use of § 3553(a) is also a possible (but unlikely) reading of the new
 Advisory Committee Note. (Interestingly, Congress explicitly directed consideration of the § 3553(a)
 sentencing factors in § 3582(a) dealing with imposition of sentence and in § 3582(c) for the other

 that “reflect” substantial assistance maintains the substantive standard chosen by

 Congress and thus does not run afoul of the Rules Enabling Act.

                                        C. In Summary

        In § 3582, Congress distinguished imposition of a sentence from

 modification of a previously imposed sentence. Compare 18 U.S.C. § 3582(a) with

 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c). For modification of a previously imposed sentence under

 subsection (c), the legality of the original sentence is assumed and is not under

 attack. All modifications under subsection (c) come as the result of a dispensation

 by other authorities:

        under subsection (1)(A), Bureau of Prisons motions to reduce sentences,
        usually involving prisoner age and/or illness, 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A);

        under subsection (1)(B), prosecutor motions to reduce sentences under Rule
        35(b)30 for substantial assistance, 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(B); and

        under subsection (2), as a result of post-sentencing Guidelines amendments
        by the Commission, 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).31

 In each instance, Congress assigned the Commission the task of guiding the

 reduction.32 The Commission never promulgated a policy statement for Rule

 35(b). But the § 5K1.1 policy statement guides by analogy, and some of the early

 caselaw drew equivalent guidance from the congressional requirement that the

 reduction “reflect” the substantial assistance. Therefore, notwithstanding the


 two reduction categories. But nowhere did Congress require consideration of the § 3553(a) factors
 for a Rule 35(b) motion. Nevertheless, the caselaw has permitted it.)
 30 Or express statutory provisions, see supra n.7.
 31 Under this provision, a defendant may move for the reduction―as may the Director of the Bureau

 of Prisons or the court itself―but only after the Sentencing Commission has amended the
 Guidelines.
 32 Section 3582(c) requires that the Bureau of Prisons and post-sentence Guidelines amendment

 reductions be “consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.”
 18 U.S.C. §§ 3582(c)(1)(A), (c)(2). Congress wrote the equivalent language into Rule 35(b).


                                                                                               22

 deletion of all reference to the Commission and to the “reflect” requirement, I

 follow the earlier caselaw and limit any reduction to that justified only by

 substantial assistance. The Sixth Amendment right to jury trial is not implicated

 in such a reduction.

                             D. Application to this Defendant

       Operating under the restrictions of the caselaw interpreting old Rule 35(b)

 and, by analogy, the factors listed in § 5K1.1, I consider the following in

 determining how far to reduce this defendant’s sentence:

       1.      His assistance was significant and useful. The government could not
            successfully prosecute the other responsible person, his cousin, without
            this defendant’s assistance; his proffer was not merely helpful, it was
            essential; only this defendant’s assistance could generate a conviction.
       2.      The defendant’s information was entirely truthful, complete and
            reliable once he decided to provide assistance under Rule 35(b).
       3.      The nature and extent of the assistance was unusual:
               a.      This twenty-one-year-old had to turn in his father’s brother’s
                    son, a very difficult decision because of the strong family
                    relationships.   He could not bring himself to do so initially
                    because of family pressure. Only increasing age and maturity led
                    him to the decision. It has, in fact, created a severe family rift. He
                    had to shoulder responsibility for the relations of an older
                    generation and an entire family.
               b.      He also agreed to withdraw his appeal (of the suppression
                    ruling; of his conviction; and of the sentence).
       4.      There was danger or risk of injury. For a young man to cooperate
            while in prison generates expectable risks.
       5.      His assistance was timely for Rule 35(b) cooperation.            I do not
            consider the fact that it was late for § 5K1.1 purposes. The purpose of

                                                                                       23
Case 2:05-cr-00069-DBH Document 158 Filed 02/04/08 Page 24 of 33                    PageID #: 1249



             Rule 35(b) is to give credit for substantial assistance that occurs only
             after sentencing. Therefore, the fact that it is after sentencing cannot
             make it “late.”

 Considering only those substantial assistance-related factors, I REDUCE the

 defendant’s sentence to forty (40) months. The § 3553(a) factors that can be used

 to limit a reduction call for significant prison time (offense seriousness, general

 deterrence, respect for the law, the Guidelines range). In the absence of authority

 to consider § 3553(a) factors that could increase the reduction, those factors (and

 the defendant’s failure to accept responsibility initially and his lie at the

 suppression hearing) lead me not to reduce the sentence farther than forty

 months.33

        If my analysis of the new Rule 35(b) is incorrect, and if I am able to consider

 § 3553(a) factors generally on this motion,34 I would take into account the

 following ameliorating factors:

        1.      The defendant’s cousin, who was just as culpable, indeed slightly
             more so (I base that conclusion on the transcript of this defendant’s trial
             and the prosecutor’s statement at the Rule 35 hearing), was prosecuted
             only as a juvenile, not as an adult, although the prosecution agrees that
             he could have been prosecuted as an adult. As a result, the cousin,
             unlike the defendant, is not a convicted federal felon and received a
             drastically lesser penalty.          See § 3553(a)(6) (“the need to avoid
             unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records
             who have been found guilty of similar conduct”). But at the same time I


 33 Even under the post-Sentencing Reform Act version of the rule, “the essence of a Rule 35(b)
 determination-the district court’s discretionary decision whether to reduce a defendant’s sentence,
 and if so, to what extent-remains intact.” McAndrews, 12 F.3d at 279 n.9.
 34 I did consider § 3553(a) factors at sentencing, but then the 5-year mandatory minimum limited

 (continued on next page)

                                                                                                 24
Case 2:05-cr-00069-DBH Document 158 Filed 02/04/08 Page 25 of 33                      PageID #: 1250



             recognize that because of the Guidelines range, many defendants like
             this defendant have been and will be sentenced much higher, more like
             the sentence I imposed initially. Thus, the disparity factor would lead to
             some further reduction, but not enough to make his sentence
             comparable to that of his cousin.35
        2.      This crime involved the destruction of property, and restitution is
             due.   Because of the five-year statutory minimum, I was unable to
             consider this sentencing factor, see § 3553(a)(7), in any meaningful way
             at the original sentence.         But clearly, this young man, who is very
             employable, can begin to pay restitution sooner if he leaves prison
             sooner. That is a sentencing goal under § 3553(a)(7).
        3.      Protecting the public, see § 3553(a)(2)(c), and just punishment, see
             § 3553(a)(2)(A), do not require a longer sentence here. This young man
             is highly unlikely ever to be involved in such activity again. It was
             criminal, it was dangerous (particularly so because of the soda
             machine’s proximity to petroleum and propane products), and it could
             have resulted in serious injury or death, but it was also adolescent
             conduct. See § 3553(a)(1) (“nature and circumstances of the offense and
             the history and characteristics of the defendant”).




 their effect in any ameliorating way.
 35 The caselaw is in some disarray on this factor. See United States v. Cirilo-Munoz, 504 F.3d 106,
 127 (1st Cir. 2007) (per curiam) (no majority opinion but two judges agreeing that a sentence is not
 “unreasonable merely because it is disproportionate to the sentence imposed on [a] co-defendant”);
 United States v. Vazques-Rivera, 470 F.3d 443, 449 (1st Cir. 2006) (“[A] district court may consider
 disparities among co-defendants in determining a sentence.”); United States v. Mueffelman, 470
 F.3d 33, 40 (1st Cir. 2006) (“[C]entral concern with disparities is between what the defendant was
 given and what is done nationally with defendants in the same circumstances.”); United States v.
 Saez, 444 F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 2006) (“[W]ith different judges sentencing two defendants quite
 differently, there is no more reason to think that the first one was right than the second.”); United
 States v. Parker, 462 F.3d 273, 277 (3d Cir. 2006) (“Although § 3553(a) does not require district
 courts to consider sentencing disparity among co-defendants, it also does not prohibit them from
 doing so.”); United States v. Wills, 476 F.3d 103, 110 (2d Cir. 2007) (same); United States v.
 Krutsinger, 449 F.3d 827, 830 (8th Cir. 2006) (under § 3553(a), no abuse of discretion “in
 fashioning a sentence that attempted to address the disparity in sentences between two nearly
 identically situated individuals who committed the same crime in the same conspiracy”).


                                                                                                   25
Case 2:05-cr-00069-DBH Document 158 Filed 02/04/08 Page 26 of 33     PageID #: 1251



 If I were able to consider these additional § 3553(a) factors, I would reduce the

 defendant’s sentence to thirty months.

                                 III. CONCLUSION

       Under the law as I understand it, the government’s motion under Rule

 35(b)(1) is GRANTED. The defendant’s sentence is reduced to forty (40) months.

       SO ORDERED.

 Here is the history behind the adoption of the December 2007 amendment to Rule 35(b).
        Following United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), a subcommittee of the Advisory
 Committee on Criminal Rules (“the Booker Subcommittee”) reviewed the Federal Rules of Criminal
 procedure to determine what rules required revision in light of Booker. It recommended changes to
 a handful of rules, including Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(b).       The subcommittee concluded that
 subparagraph (b)(1)(B) (“reducing the sentence accords with the Sentencing Commission’s
 Guidelines and policy statements”) was “inconsistent with Booker’s holding that the Guidelines
 cannot be mandatory.” Mem. from Booker Subcommittee to Advisory Committee on Criminal
 Rules, 4 (Mar. 15, 2005) in Agenda Materials of the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules, April
 2005, available at http://www.uscourts.gov/rules/Agenda_Books.htm#criminal.          The Booker
 Subcommittee recommended deleting subparagraph (B) and merging subparagraph (A) into the
 introductory clause of (b)(1). Id. According to the memorandum recommending the change to Rule
 35:
               One member of the subcommittee felt that this change was
               unnecessary, because there are no guidelines (and thus certainly no
               mandatory guidelines) at present that govern resentencings in
               substantial assistance cases. Other committee members felt that
               the text of the rules should not appear to give guidelines mandatory
               effect, and noted that future guidelines might govern resentencing.

 Id.1
        At its April 2005 meeting, the full Advisory Committee approved the amendment and voted
 to publish it for comment. Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules, Minutes, 6 (Apr. 4-5, 2005),
 available at http://www.uscourts.gov/rules/minutes.htm. In its subsequent recommendation to the
 Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure that the amendment be published for
 public comment, the Advisory Committee explained the proposed amendment:
               This amendment conforms Rule 35(b)(1)(B) to the Supreme Court’s
               decision in United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), holding
               that the guidelines are advisory, rather than mandatory. The rule
               currently states that the court may reduce a sentence if “reducing
               the sentence accords with the Sentencing Commission’s guidelines
               and policy statements.” Although the guidelines do not currently
               include provisions governing the correction of sentences under Rule
               35, the amendment removes the rule’s language that seems, on its
               face, to be inconsistent with the ruling in Booker.

 1 In the same memorandum, the Booker Subcommittee recommended no change to Rule 35(b)(2)
 (substantial assistance reductions after one year has passed) because “this provision seems
 unobjectionable, since this is a reduction after the defendant has been sentenced.” Mem. from

 Mem. from Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules to Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and
 Procedure, 5 (May 17, 2005) in Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, Preliminary Draft of
 Proposed Amendments to the Federal Rules of Appellate, Bankruptcy, Civil, and Criminal
 Procedure: Request for Comment (August 2005), available at http://www.uscourts.gov/rules/
 proposed0206.htm.
        In August 2005, the Standing Committee published for comment the proposed amendment
 to Rule 35, among others. See Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, Preliminary Draft of
 Proposed Amendments to the Federal Rules of Appellate, Bankruptcy, Civil, and Criminal
 Procedure: Request for Comment, 146 (August 2005), available at http://www.uscourts.gov/
 rules/proposed0206.htm. The Committee Note accompanying the proposed amendment stated:
                The amendment conforms Rule 35(b)(1) to the Supreme Court’s
                decision in United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005). In
                Booker, the Court held that the provision of the federal sentencing
                statute that makes the Guidelines mandatory, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1)
                (Supp.2004), violates the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial and
                the Fifth Amendment requirement of proof beyond a reasonable
                doubt. With this provision severed and excised, the Court held, the
                Sentencing Reform Act “makes the Guidelines effectively advisory,”
                and “requires a sentencing court to consider Guidelines ranges, see
                18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(4) (Supp.2004), but it permits the court to tailor
                the sentence in light of other statutory concerns as well, see
                § 3553(a) (Supp.2004).” Id. at 757. Subsection (b)(1)(B) has been
                deleted because it treats the guidelines as mandatory.

 Id. at 147.
        The United States Sentencing Commission submitted comments on the proposed
 amendment. It asserted that § 5K1.1 “sets forth a list of factors that the sentencing court should
 consider before granting a Rule 35(b) motion.”2 It also questioned whether Booker applied at all in
 the post-sentencing context: “Because the Rule 35(b) determination involves no judicial finding of
 fact that would increase the sentence, it would not appear that a defendant’s Sixth Amendment
 rights are jeopardized by, or that Booker requires modification of, the mandatory nature of the
 current rule.” The Commission warned that removing the reference to Sentencing Commission
 Guidelines and policy statements in Rule 35(b) “may result in consideration of factors other than
 the value of the defendant’s substantial assistance or post-sentence cooperation.” Noting “that
 Booker’s remedial opinion requires court consideration of applicable Commission policy
 statements[,]” the Commission requested that “amended Rule 35(b) . . . reflect the continued


 2I emphasize the “should.” The comment came from the Commission’s Staff Director. She did not
 actually state that § 5K1.1 was the policy statement that Congress directed the Commission to
 adopt for Rule 35(b) in § 994(a)(2)(C). I have explained in note 13 supra why § 5K1.1 cannot be
 considered the controlling policy statement.

                                                                                                  ii

 requirement that courts consult and consider the guidelines and policy statements before making
 any such sentence reduction.” The Commission also recommended that the Committee Note
 accompanying the amendment “clarify that the changes are not intended to enlarge the bases of
 what a court may consider before imposing a post-sentence reduction.” Letter from Judith W.
 Sheon, Staff Director, United States Sentencing Commission, to Committee on Rules of Practice
 and Procedure (Feb. 15, 2006), available at http://www.uscourts.gov/rules/CR%20Rules%202005.htm.3
        Responding to the Sentencing Commission’s suggestion that Booker might not apply in the
 post-sentencing context, the Reporter to the Advisory Committee “recommended against adopting
 the changes to the Rule 35 amendment suggested by the Sentencing Commission.” Advisory
 Committee      on    Criminal     Rules,     Minutes,     6    (April 3-4,      2006),       available    at
 http://www.uscourts.gov/rules/minutes.htm. She did, however, propose the following addition to the
 Committee Note: “The amendment is not intended to alter the factors a court may consider before
 imposing a post-sentence reduction.” The Reporter explained that the additional language was
 intended “only to indicate that by amending the rule the Committee [took] no position on the scope
 of the court’s authority to reduce a sentence under Rule 35.” Mem. from Professor Sara Sun Beale,
 Reporter, to Members, Criminal Rules Advisory Committee (March 11, 2006) in Agenda Materials of
 the    Advisory     Committee       on      Criminal     Rules,      April      2006,        available    at
 http://www.uscourts.gov/rules/Agenda_Books.htm#criminal. The Committee, however, made no
 changes to the proposed Rule 35 amendment and approved it, as published, without objection.

 http://www.uscourts.gov/rules/minutes.htm.
        In a subsequent memorandum to the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and
 Procedure recommending that the Standing Committee approve the proposed amendment and
 forward it to the Judicial Conference, the Chair of the Advisory Committee stated:


 3 The Committee received two other comments. The National Association of Criminal Defense
 Lawyers (NACDL) embraced the Advisory Committee’s conclusion that Rule 35(b)’s reference to the
 Guidelines must be removed because the Guidelines were no longer mandatory. NACDL asserted
 that sentencing judges must now comply with 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) rather than the Guidelines and
 reduce a sentence, if at all, “to the extent that it will become or remain ‘sufficient, but not greater
 than necessary’ to achieve the purposes of the criminal justice system.” Letter from William J.
 Genego and Peter Goldberger, Co-Chairs, National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers
 Committee on Rules of Procedure, to Peter G. McCabe, Secretary, Standing Committee on Rules of
 Practice and Procedure, 6-7 (Feb. 15, 2006), available at http://www.uscourts.gov/rules/
 CR%20Rules%202005.htm. NACDL also advocated deleting the requirement that the government
 must file a motion before a sentence reduction is permitted. Finally, a comment on behalf of the
 Federal Public and Community Defenders pointed out that, contrary to the proposed Advisory
 Committee Note, Booker’s holding did not address the Fifth Amendment standard of proof
 requirement, but was grounded in the Sixth Amendment only. See Testimony of Jon Sands, Chair,
 Federal Defender Sentencing Guidelines Committee, before the Advisory Committee on Federal
 Rules of Criminal Procedure, Jan. 6, 2006.

               This amendment conforms Rule 35(b)(1)(B) to the Supreme Court’s
               decision in United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), holding
               that the Guidelines are advisory, rather than mandatory. The rule
               currently states that the court may reduce a sentence if “reducing
               the sentence accords with the Sentencing Commission’s guidelines
               and policy statements.” Although the Guidelines do not currently
               include provisions governing the correction of sentences under Rule
               35, the amendment removes the rule’s language that seems, on its
               face, to be inconsistent with the decision in Booker.
               Both the Sentencing Commission and the National Association of
               Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) suggested changes in either the
               amendment or the note. After discussion, the Committee decided
               not to alter the amendment. In essence, the proposed changes
               introduced additional issues that were not part of the amendment as
               published. NACDL suggested that given the advisory character of
               the Guidelines, it is no longer appropriate for the rule to require that
               the motion be made by the government, since powerful evidence of
               cooperation should be considered under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) even in
               the absence of such a motion. The language of the rule, however,
               was enacted by Congress. Even if the Committee had the authority
               to delete this requirement under the Rules Enabling Act, it could not
               do so without publishing such an amendment for public comment.
               The Sentencing Commission raised the question whether the Booker
               remedial opinion is applicable to the post-sentencing context. It
               suggested that the Committee Note be amended to address this
               issue. The Committee unanimously declined to introduce the new
               language to the Note, or otherwise to alter the rule as published for
               public comment. (The only exception was the agreement to
               eliminate the reference to the Fifth Amendment in the description of
               the Booker decision in this Note, as well as the notes accompanying
               the other amendments.)

        The Standing Committee approved the amendment, without objection, and sent it to the
 Judicial Conference for final approval. Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, Minutes, 27
 (June 22-23, 2006), available at http://www.uscourts.gov/rules/minutes.htm.              The Judicial
 Conference approved the amendment at its September 19, 2006 meeting and transmitted it to the
 Supreme Court, along with several other proposed amendments to the Federal Rules. Report of
 the Proceedings of the Judicial Conference of the United States, 35 (September 19, 2006), excerpt
 available at http://www.uscourts.gov/rules/supct1106.htm. The accompanying discussion of Rule 35
 was brief:
               The proposed amendment to Rule 35 removes the restriction that
               the court may reduce the sentence of a cooperating defendant only if
               the reduced sentence accords with the Sentencing Guidelines and
               the Sentencing Commission’s policy statements. The restriction is
               stricken as inconsistent with Booker because it treats the guidelines
               as mandatory.
