                 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                       DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                                   Criminal No. 11-cr-159-JD

Ulrick Lucien


                                  O R D E R


     Ulrick Lucien is charged with making a false statement while

acquiring firearms in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922.             Lucien moves

to suppress statements that he allegedly made to Special Agent

Kelter on the day of his arrest on the ground that admission of

the statements at trial would violate the protections of the

Fifth Amendment and Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).             In

response, the government represents that Lucien’s statements to

Kelter are not relevant to its case in chief against Lucien.

Based on that representation, the government argues that Lucien’s

motion to suppress is moot.

     Because the government has represented that Lucien’s

statements to Kelter are not relevant, the government shall not

elicit those statements at trial nor elicit any testimony

concerning Miranda warnings.         Government witnesses shall be

thoroughly instructed not to refer to these matters.

                                Conclusion

      For the foregoing reasons, the defendant’s motion to

suppress (document no. 39) is terminated.

      SO ORDERED.
