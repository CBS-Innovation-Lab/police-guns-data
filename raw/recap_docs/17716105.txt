A d Restitution Not Applicable.
B Total Amount of Restitution:
C Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

l Ei For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

2 i:i For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S,C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under |8 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(B).
3 i:i For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U,S.C. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh

the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U,S,C. § 3663(a)(1)(B)(ii).

4 i:i Restitution is not ordered for other reasons (Explain.)

D i:i Partial restitution is ordered for these reasons (18 U.S.C. §3553(c)):
