                             UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                               DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA                      :

VS.                                           :                       1:97-CR-107ML

THEODORE PERRY                                :

                     MOTION TO TERMINATE SUPERVISED RELEASE

       NOW COMES the defendant, Theodore Perry, and moves that this Honorable Court

consider terminating the supervised release term of three (3) years which was imposed at the

defendant’s sentencing on July 21, 1998. Supervised release is scheduled to end in September of

2007, however, the defendant seeks early termination to enable him to obtain additional

employment at “Turning The Corner”. In support of this motion, defense counsel states that Mr.

Perry, since his release from prison, has done an exemplary job in rehabilitating himself.

Attached to this motion are a number of certificates attesting to rehabilitative actions taken by the

defendant.

                                              THEODORE PERRY,
                                              By his attorney,
