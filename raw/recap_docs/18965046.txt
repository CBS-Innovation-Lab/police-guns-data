                       DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                              Criminal Nos. 10-cr-110-01-JD
                                                   10-cr-111-01-JD

                                  O R D E R


     Counsel for the defendant has filed a motion, assented to by

the government, seeking a psychiatric evaluation of the defendant

to determine his mental competency to stand trial (document no.

14) for reasons set forth in the motion.           The motion is granted

and the requested funds are approved.

     The court finds that there is reasonable cause to believe

that the defendant may presently be suffering from a mental

disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent as defined

in Title 18, United States Code, § 4241(a).           Therefore, pursuant

to 18 U.S.C. § 4241 and § 4247(b) a psychiatric examination of

the defendant shall be undertaken by Dr. Albert Drukteinis.

Following the examination, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 4247(c) a

psychiatric report shall be prepared and filed with the court

which shall include (1) the defendant’s history and present

symptoms; (2) a description of the psychiatric, psychological,

and medical tests that were employed and their results; (3) the

examiner’s findings; and (4) the examiner’s opinions as to

diagnosis, prognosis and whether the defendant is suffering from

a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent to

the extent that he is unable to understand the nature and

consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist properly

in his defense.

      The report shall be filed with the court with copies

provided to the government and counsel for the defendant in

accordance with the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 4247(c).

      Subsequent to the filing of the above-referenced report, a

hearing shall be scheduled promptly to determine the mental

competency of the defendant, pursuant to Title 18, U.S.C. §§

4241(c) and (d) and 4247(d).



      SO ORDERED.
