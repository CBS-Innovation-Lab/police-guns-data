                                  ORDER

                          December 18, 2015

Saris, C.J.

     For the reasons stated below, the Court DENIES the

defendant’s motion for the return of property or compensation for

the same.
                            I.   BACKGROUND

     On or about June 23, 2004, federal law enforcement executed

a search warrant at the then-current residence of Michael Alan

Crooker (“Crooker”).    A laptop computer was seized at the time.

In 2012, upon Crooker’s motion under Rule 41(g) of the Federal

Rules of Criminal Procedure ("Rule 41(g)") for the return of

property, the Court ordered that the government return the seized

property to Crooker.    Per the agreement of the parties, the

government returned the laptop computer and other property to

Crooker by delivering it to Peter Crooker ("Peter"), the

defendant’s brother, in 2012.

     In 2014, Crooker filed the present motion, contending that a

laptop case containing a power cord was seized during the June

23, 2004 search but not returned to him.        He represents that he

discovered this omission in early 2014, when he asked his brother

to retrieve some electronic files of photographs from the laptop

and Peter was unable to do so because the laptop battery did not

function and there was no power cord with the laptop.          Crooker

seeks reimbursement for the money that his brother spent to buy a

power cord ($42), a laptop case ($20), and gas to drive between

various destinations to procure the missing items ($40).

     In its opposition to the motion (#298), the government

contends that the laptop in question was seized without a power

cord or case, although the government does state that an

"abandoned" laptop case without a cord was seized at Crooker’s

previous residence during a different search.         The government

included the affidavits of an Special Agent Richard Winfield of

the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI") and Special Agent

Brian Person of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and

Explosives ("ATF").    They both swear that there is no record of a

seizure of a laptop case or power cord from Crooker’s residence.

The government submitted a photo of a computer on a shelf.             It is

not in a case and there does not appear to be a power cord

attached to it.   There is no laptop case visible in the photo.

Special Agent Person states in his affidavit that the photo is of

the laptop computer as it was found during the execution of the

search warrant.

     The two agents state that Peter refused some of the property

for lack of space.    Special Agent Person states that, in December

2012, he met in person with Crooker at FMC Devens and reviewed

with him the list of remaining evidence that the ATF had in its

custody, including the items that Peter had refused.          Agent

Person represents that there was not laptop power cord or case

listed on the property in the ATF’s custody, nor did Crooker

inquire about the same.

         Crooker insists in his proposed reply memorandum (#299)

that a case with a power cord was seized with the laptop.                 He

also claims that laptop case seized from his previous residence

was not abandoned and that it also held a power court.             The

defendant reasons, "Logic dictates that [the government] would

not seize a laptop (that might have a dead battery) without also

seizing one of the power cords because they would want to turn it

on to gain access to Crooker’s data."          (Proposed Reply at 1).
                              II.   DISCUSSION

     Upon review of the evidence–-affidavits of Special Agents

Winfield and Person; photograph of the laptop; Crooker’s

affidavit–-the Court concludes that Crooker has not shown by the

preponderance of the evidence that government seized a laptop

case and power cord.1       Other than Crooker’s bald assertion that a

laptop and power cord were seized, he has not proffered any

evidence that such seizure took place.           Further, his reasoning
that the government would not seize a computer without taking a

nearby power cord is unpersuasive.          Surely, the government is not

dependent on the power cords of the owners of seized computers to

examine the electronic contents.

      The Court is not obligated to hold an evidentiary hearing
on a Rule 41(g). See United States v. Cardona-Sandoval, 518 F.3d
13, 16 (1st Cir. 2008) (“Affidavits or documentary evidence, such
as chain of custody records, may suffice to support the district
court's determination in a given case.”).

     Even, assuming, arguendo, that such seizure did take place,

Crooker has not shown by the      preponderance of the evidence that

the government continues to hold the property, or why the

government would do so.     In contrast, the government appears to

have been very thorough in regards to returning property to

Crooker, as set forth in Special Agent Person’s affidavit.

     Further, to the extent that the only remedy Crooker seeks is

monetary compensation, the doctrine of sovereign immunity

precludes such relief in the context of a motion under Rule 41(g)

of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, even where the

property in question cannot be returned.        See United States v.
Drogues, 728 F.3d 580, 589-90 (6th Cir. 2013); Ordonez v. United

States, 680 F.3d 1135, 1138-40 & n.2 (9th Cir. 2012) (citing

cases in agreement from the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth,

Seventh, Eighth, Tenth, and Eleventh circuits).
                              III.   ORDER

     Accordingly, the motion to file a reply memorandum (#299) is

GRANTED and the motion for return of property (#295) is DENIED.



     SO ORDERED.
