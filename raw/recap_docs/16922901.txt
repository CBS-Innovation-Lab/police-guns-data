This case involves a simple charge and an endless procedural
history caused primarily by the defendant’s problematic mental
capacity. Currently pending before the Court is the defendant's
motion to dismiss the indictment against him, which is opposed by
the government.

I. Background

The defendant, John Leonard Ecker (“Ecker”), was charged on
November 8, 1989, with one count of felony possession of a
firearm under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g). Ecker is a Massachusetts
resident whose mother still lives in the Commonwealth. Because
the defendant is subject to 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), which is
applicable to persons with three prior convictions for violent
felonies or serious drug offenses, the crime with which Ecker is
charged carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years and a

maximum sentence of life imprisonment. nga §§i;§g_§tat§§ v.
He§m§, 322 F.3d 18, 26 (1st Cir. 2003). The defendant has been
held in federal custody for more than 15 years without being
tried. His case remains pending because he has been found
incompetent to stand trial on numerous occasions.

After his initial appearance in court, Ecker moved for, and
was granted, a psychiatric exam. From January, 1990, to March,
1993, the defendant was subjected to seven competency evaluations
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 4241, most of which determined that he
was unfit to stand trial. At the last of those evaluations
(conducted in March, 1993), the staff of the Federal Medical
Center in Rochester, Minnesota (“FMC-Rochester”} found Ecker
incompetent and unlikely to regain competency in the near future.
Furthermore, the staff concluded that

it is our professional opinion that Mr. Ecker is presently

suffering from a mental disease or defect such that his

release would present a substantial risk of bodily injury to

another person or serious damage to the property of another.

That finding rendered the defendant potentially subject to
indefinite confinement under 18 U.S.C. § 4246. Accordingly, in
April, 1993, United States District Judge Robert E. Keeton
determined that Ecker was not competent to stand trial and
ordered further evaluation to determine whether proceedings under
§ 4246 were warranted. When the Warden of FMC-Rochester

certified the finding made by his staff, the United States

Attorney for the District of Minnesota instituted commitment

proceedings. As a result of those proceedings, Ecker was
committed to the custody of the Attorney General under § 4246
which decision was affirmed by the Eighth Circuit Court of
Appeals. United States v. §gker, 30 F.3d 966 (8th Cir. 1994)
(hereinafter, “Ecker I”).

On January 30, 1995, Ecker filed a motion to dismiss the
indictment against him on the grounds that l) commitment pursuant
to § 4246 requires dismissal of pending charges and 2) the
pending indictment unconstitutionally interfered with his right
to be transferred to a facility in his home state of
Massachusetts. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts had apparently
refused to accept custody of Ecker while the federal indictment
remained pending. Judge Keeton denied Ecker’s motion to dismiss
in July, 1995, and that decision was affirmed by the First
Circuit Court of Appeals on March 8, 1996. United States v.
§gk§r, 78 F.3d 726 (1st Cir. 1996) (hereinafter, “Ecker II”).

Docket entries are scarce between Marchr 1996, and March,
2004, at which time the government requested another competency
hearing and the defendant asserted that he was competent and
ready to stand trial. On June 16, 2004, the government moved for
a further psychiatric evaluation. At a competency hearing held
on July 14, 2005, Judge Keeton determined that Ecker was not
currently competent to stand trial nor was he likely to become

competent in the foreseeable future.

In August, 2005, the case was transferred to this session of
the Court and a status conference was held on October 15, 2005.
Ecker has since filed another motion to dismiss the indictment,
which the government opposes.

II. Discussion

In reviewing a motion to dismiss an indictment, a court
presumes the truth of all factual allegations in that indictment.
See United States v. Bohai Trading Co.l Inc., 45 F.3d 577, 578
n.l (lst Cir. 1995) (citing Boyce Motor Linesl Inc. v. United
States, 342 U.S. 337, 343 n.16 (1952)).

Ecker contends that to permit the indictment in his case to
survive beyond the expiration of the mandatory minimum sentence
to which a conviction would subject him while he is detained
outside of his home state without any expectation or hope of
trial, constitutes a violation of his constitutional rights to
liberty and due process. In response to the government’s concern
about his serious psychiatric and criminal history, he asserts
that dismissal of the indictment will not result in his release
from custody because he is still subject to commitment under 18
U.S.C. § 4246. What dismissal of the indictment would permit and
encourage, however, is the transfer of Ecker to a treatment
facility in his home state of Massachusetts.

The government responds that this Court's decision is

dictated by stare decisis. In essence, the government contends

 

Case 3:89-cr-30028-NI\/|G Document 194 Filed 03/17/06 Page 5 of 8

that the legal issues now presented by Ecker were conclusively
decided by Judge Keeton in 1995 and that because that decision
was affirmed on appeal in 1996, this Court is bound to deny
Ecker's pending motion. Furthermore, the government argues that
the indictment should not be dismissed because, contrary to the
contention of Ecker, it is unclear whether he 1) might regain
competency in the future, 2) would receive a sentence longer than
the mandatory minimum if convicted and 3) would be transferred to
a Massachusetts facility if the indictment were dismissed.

After considering the interminable and complex factual
record in this case, the parties’ arguments and relevant legal
precedent, the Court concludes that the indictment must be
dismissed.

In Jackson v. Indiana, the United States Supreme Court held
that indefinite pretrial commitment on the grounds of
incompetence effected a violation of due process. ee 406 U.S.
715 (1972). Specifically, the Supreme Court stated that

a person charged by a State with a criminal offense who is

committed solely on account of his incapacity to proceed to

trial cannot be held more than the reasonable period of time
necessary to determine whether there is a substantial
probability that he will attain that capacity in the
foreseeable future. ... [E]ven if it is determined that the
defendant probably soon will be able to stand trial, his
continued commitment must be justified by progress toward
that goal.

Id. at 738. In United States v. DeBellis, the First Circuit

Court of Appeals held that where a criminal defendant was

Case 3:89-cr-30028-NI\/|G Document 194 Filed 03/17/06 Page 6 of 8

detained for longer than the maximum possible sentence in order
to determine his competency to stand trial, that detention was
per §§ unreasonable under Jackson, supra.l §§e 649 F.2d l, 3
(1st Cir. 1981).

In this case, the Court finds that there is no reasonable
likelihood that Ecker will regain competency to stand trial.
Although the defendant has been deemed competent by medical
personnel on three occasions during the past 16 years, those
determinations have always been quickly revoked. Ecker's brief
interludes of lucidity are obviously too short-lived or
infrequent to indicate a “substantial probability that he will
attain capacity in the foreseeable future”. Jackson, 406 U.S. at
738.

In light of Ecker’s persistently incompetent state and the
lack of any progress toward trial, the Court concludes that his
pretrial commitment for a term longer than the 15-year mandatory
minimum sentence which he would be required to serve if convicted
is unreasonable and therefore infringes upon his rights under the
Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The fact that
Ecker could, in theory, be sentenced to a term longer than 15

years does not render his present detention reasonable

 

1 The defendant in DeBellis had been charged with a crime
carrying a maximum possible sentence of 30 days imprisonment and,
by the time his appeal was decided, had been held in custody for
approximately 15 weeks.

_6_

considering the unlikelihood of such a sentence or a change in
Ecker's mental state.

The government’s stare decisis argument is unpersuasive

 

because ten years have passed since the First Circuit Court of
Appeals affirmed the denial of Ecker’s previous motion to dismiss
the indictment. Notably, that decision addressed an argument
that Ecker does not press today, namely that commitment under

§ 4246 requires dismissal of a pending indictment. gee Ecker II,
supra. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, which did address
the reasonableness of Ecker's pretrial commitment, concluded that
the defendant’s detention was not unreasonable as of 1994 but
that such detention would be unconstitutional if it exceeded his
“possible" sentence. Ecker I, 30 F.3d at 969.

The passage of time clearly diminishes the force of those
earlier decisions. As a result of his incarceration for the past
16 yearsr Ecker has effectively served more than the mandatory
minimum sentence on a charge for which he has never been
convicted and there has been no indication of meaningful progress
toward trial. Under these circumstances, it is unreasonable for
the government to continue to imprison Ecker on the grounds that
he might be declared competent to stand trial on some future
date. lt is beside the point that, upon dismissal of the
indictment, the defendant may not necessarily be transferred to a

Massachusetts facility pursuant to his commitment under 18 U.S.C.

Case 3:89-cr-30028-NI\/|G Document 194 Filed 03/17/06 Page 8 of 8

§ 4246.

ORDER
In accordance with the foregoing, the Defendant's Motion to
Dismiss the Indictment with Prejudice (Docket No. 189) is
ALLOWED. Ecker will continue to be held in custody pursuant to

18 U.S.C. § 4246 pending possible transfer to a facility in

Massachusetts.

So ordered.
