                  RECOMMENDED DECISION ON 28 U.S.C. § 2255 MOTION

         In this action, Petitioner Raymond L. Ellis, Jr., moves, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255, to

vacate, set aside or correct his sentence. (Motion, ECF No. 59.) Following a guilty plea, Petitioner

was convicted of theft of firearms from a federal firearms licensee, conspiracy to commit theft,

and possession of firearms as a convicted felon. (Judgment, ECF No. 29 at 1.) The Court

sentenced Petitioner to 120 months in prison. (Id. at 2.) In 2011, the First Circuit upheld the

sentence on appeal. United States v. Ellis, No. 10-1052 (1st Cir. Mar. 17, 2011).

         Petitioner alleges that he signed his section 2255 motion in December 2015, and it was

filed in January 2015. (Motion at 1, 13.) Petitioner argues that the Court erred as a matter of law

when it enhanced his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6); he contends that the applicable

guidelines range was 92 to 115 months rather than the 135 to 168 months found by the Court at

sentencing.1 (Motion at 4; Attachment, ECF No. 59-1 at 1-3.) Petitioner also asserts a related

claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. (Motion at 5; Attachment at 4-5.) Petitioner requests

resentencing. (Motion at 13; Attachment at 7.)


1
 U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) states in relevant part: “If the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in
connection with another felony offense; or possessed or transferred any firearm or ammunition with knowledge, intent,
or reason to believe that it would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense, increase by 4 levels.”

       The Court ordered the Government to respond, and to limit the response to the statute of

limitations issue. (Order, ECF No. 62.) The Government requests that the motion be dismissed

as untimely. (Response, ECF No. 69.) Following a review of Petitioner’s motion and the

Government’s request for dismissal, I recommend the Court grant the Government’s request, and

dismiss Petitioner’s motion.

                  I.     FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

       At a hearing in July 2009, Petitioner waived indictment and pled guilty to a three-count

information in which the Government alleged that: (1) on or about February 8, 2009, in violation

of 18 U.S.C. § 922(u), Petitioner stole twelve firearms, which previously had been shipped and

transported in interstate commerce, from a licensed firearms dealer in Benton, Maine (Count 1);

(2) from February 8, 2009, to February 10, 2009, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, Petitioner

conspired with others to steal the firearms (Count 2); and (3) on or about February 8, 2009, in

violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), Petitioner, having been convicted previously of burglarizing a

dwelling, knowingly possessed the twelve firearms (Count 3).             (Waiver of Indictment,

Arraignment, and Plea Tr., ECF No. 17 at 4-10, 26-27.) During the plea colloquy, Petitioner told

the Court that he believed that the information contained in the prosecution version of the offense

was true. (Id. at 17.)

       The prosecution version states that Petitioner committed the robbery with another person.

(Prosecution Version, ECF No. 8 at 1-3.) Petitioner was armed with a baseball bat, and his partner

had a metal pipe or rod. (Id. at 1-2.) They donned disguises, and after they entered the store,

Petitioner brandished the baseball bat, and he and his partner twice ordered the store employees to

the ground. (Id. at 2.) When the employees were on the ground, Petitioner used the baseball bat

to break the glass of a display case, and he removed the firearms and a silencer. (Id. at 2-3.)



                                                2
Case 1:09-cr-00103-JAW Document 72 Filed 11/14/16 Page 3 of 8                       PageID #: 290



Petitioner’s partner took approximately $2,000 in cash, and they left. (Id. at 3.) Petitioner and his

partner divided the proceeds from the robbery; Petitioner’s partner received two of the firearms

and approximately $500, and Petitioner kept the remaining firearms, the silencer, and

approximately $1,500. (Id.) The next day, Petitioner, his girlfriend, and another person travelled

to New Hampshire; Petitioner kept one of the firearms and the silencer, and he “gave the remaining

firearms to his girlfriend and her cousin for the purpose of selling the firearms for money and/or

trading the firearms for cocaine.” (Id. at 3-4.)

       Following the plea colloquy, the Court made the requisite findings and accepted

Petitioner’s guilty plea. (Waiver of Indictment, Arraignment, and Plea Tr. at 27.) At Petitioner’s

sentencing hearing in December 2009, the Court told Petitioner that the Court intended to rely on

the contents of the revised presentence investigation report. (Sentencing Tr., ECF No. 52 at 4.)

The Court asked Petitioner whether he had reviewed the report, whether he understood it, and

whether he had found anything incorrect or inaccurate in the report. (Id.) Petitioner replied that

he had reviewed the report, he understood it, and he did not know of anything incorrect or

inaccurate in the report. (Id.)

       The Court determined, consistent with the revised presentence investigation report, that the

base offense level was 26. (Id. at 5.) The Court applied two four-level increases, one pursuant to

U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(1)(B), because the offense involved more than eight firearms; the other

pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(4)(B), because the serial numbers on two of the firearms had been

obliterated. (Id.) Given that the cumulative offense level may not exceed 29, the offense level

was reduced to 29, pursuant to U.S.S.G. 2K2.1(b). (Id.) The Court then applied an additional

four-level increase, pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6), because Petitioner possessed a firearm or

ammunition (the Count 3 offense) in connection with another felony offense (the Count 1 offense).

(Id.)

         From an adjusted offense level of 33, the Court applied a three-level reduction for

acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1. (Id. at 6.) The Court determined the

applicable sentencing guideline range to be from 135 to 168 months, based on a total offense level

of 30 and a criminal history category of IV. (Id.) All of the Court’s sentencing guideline

calculations were consistent with the revised presentence investigation report.

         The Court then considered the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), in

particular Petitioner’s history and characteristics, and the nature and circumstances of the offense.

(Id. at 60.) The Court sentenced Petitioner to a below-guidelines prison term of 120 months on

each of Counts 1 and 3, and to 60 months on Count 2, with all counts to be served concurrently

with one another.2 (Sentencing Tr. at 6; Judgment at 2.)

         Petitioner appealed from the sentence. On March 17, 2011, the First Circuit concluded that

this Court did not err when it considered the Government’s exhibits at the sentencing hearing, and

the First Circuit affirmed the judgment. Ellis, No. 10-1052. Petitioner did not challenge on direct

appeal the section 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement. Id. (Appellant’s Brief at 6.)

         Petitioner asserts that he placed his section 2255 motion in the prison mailing system on

December 29, 2015. (Motion at 13.) The motion was filed on January 4, 2016. (Id. at 1.)




2
  The judgment also provides that, pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 5G1.3(c), the federal sentence is to be served consecutively
to a 90-day state court sentence originally imposed in State v. Ellis, No. 2008-426 (Me. Super. Ct., Som. Cnty.), but
concurrently with the 41-month probation revocation sentence imposed in that case. (Judgment, ECF No. 29 at 2.)

         The Government filed a response in June 2016 in accordance with an extension of time

granted by the Court; Petitioner timely filed a reply in July 2016.3 (Order, ECF No. 68; Response

at 1; Reply, ECF No. 70 at 1.)

                                                  II.      DISCUSSION

         Petitioner’s claims are subject to a one-year statute of limitations, which runs from the

latest of

              (1) the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final;

              (2) the date on which the impediment to making a motion created by
              governmental action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States
              is removed, if the movant was prevented from making a motion by such
              governmental action;

              (3) the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme
              Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made
              retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or

              (4) the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could
              have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.

28 U.S.C. § 2255(f).

         Petitioner did not file a petition for certiorari, and thus the one-year limitation period started

to run upon expiration of the time to file a petition for certiorari. See In re Smith, 436 F.3d 9, 10

n.1 (1st Cir. 2006) (per curiam) (citing Clay v. United States, 537 U.S. 522, 532 (2003)). Pursuant

to Rule 13 of the Rules of the United States Supreme Court, a petition for certiorari must be filed

within 90 days after the entry of judgment.4 Petitioner’s period of limitation under section


3
 Petitioner’s reply does not contain a declaration that Petitioner makes the allegations under penalty of perjury,
pursuant to Rule 2(b)(5) of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings, which requires that the section 2255
motion “be signed under penalty of perjury by the movant or by a person authorized to sign it for the movant.” See
28 U.S.C. § 1746. This recommended decision assumes, without recommending a decision on the issue, that the Court
would permit Petitioner to file a copy that contained the required declaration.
4
  Rule 13(1) of the Rules of the United States Supreme Court states in pertinent part: “Unless otherwise provided by
law, a petition for a writ of certiorari to review a judgment in any case, civil or criminal, entered by a . . . United States
court of appeals . . . is timely when it is filed with the Clerk of this Court within 90 days after entry of the judgment.”

                                                              5
Case 1:09-cr-00103-JAW Document 72 Filed 11/14/16 Page 6 of 8                                     PageID #: 293



2255(f)(1) thus began to run 90 days after the First Circuit’s March 17, 2011, judgment, and it

expired one year later, in June 2012. Because Petitioner placed his motion in the prison mailing

system in December 2015, i.e., more than three years after the expiration of the limitations period,

Petitioner did not timely file the motion in accordance with section 2255(f)(1). In addition,

Petitioner has not alleged any facts or made any arguments to suggest that the time period is

governed by 2255(f)(2), (3), or (4). See Barreto-Barreto v. United States, 551 F.3d 95, 99-100

(1st Cir. 2008) (noting that undeveloped arguments are deemed waived).5

         Petitioner asks the Court to determine that the limitations period was equitably tolled due

in part by his lack of access to legal materials during periods when he was placed in more restrictive

prison housing conditions in 2013 and 2014. (Reply at 5-7.) Petitioner also alleges the delay was

caused in part by his lack of knowledge of the law. (Motion at 6; Reply at 1-2.)

         The one-year limitations period under section 2255(f) “is subject to equitable tolling in

appropriate instances.” Ramos–Martínez v. United States, 638 F.3d 315, 322 (1st Cir. 2011).

“Equitable tolling is a doctrine that provides that in exceptional circumstances, a statute of

limitations may be extended for equitable reasons not acknowledged in the statute creating the

limitations period.” Id. at 321 (quotation marks omitted); see also Menominee Indian Tribe of

Wisconsin v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 750, 755-56 & n.2 (2016). The burden is on a petitioner to

establish the basis for equitable tolling. Id.; Ramos-Martínez, 638 F.3d at 323. A petitioner must




5
  It appears Petitioner alleges that from August to November 2013, and from April to October 2014, he was under
prison housing restrictions that severely limited his access to legal materials. (Reply, ECF No. 70 at 6.) The Court
need not consider whether the restrictions Petitioner alleges constitute a government impediment, pursuant to
28 U.S.C. § 2255(f)(2), because, according to Petitioner’s allegations, the restrictions began in 2013, which was after
the one-year limitation period had expired. See United States v. Briggs, Nos. 96-336-1, 06-cv-3142, 2014 WL 940341,
at *4 n.8, 2014 U.S. Dist. Lexis 30854, at *16 n.8 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 7, 2014) (noting that the petitioner “has cited no
authority suggesting limited access to federal legal materials constitutes the type of ‘governmental action’ impeding
timely filing contemplated by § 2255(f)(2),” and the petitioner did not “allege any intentional misconduct or that any
governmental entity actively prevented him from filing a § 2255 motion”).

                                                          6
Case 1:09-cr-00103-JAW Document 72 Filed 11/14/16 Page 7 of 8                    PageID #: 294



prove “‘(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary

circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.’” Menominee Indian Tribe of

Wisconsin, 136 S. Ct. at 755 (quoting Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, 649 (2010) (quotation

marks omitted)).

       Petitioner’s arguments for equitable tolling are unpersuasive. Significantly, he has not

alleged that his access to materials was restricted during the one-year limitation period. In

addition, restricted access to the courts due to incarceration and limited knowledge of the law

would not support a finding of equitable tolling. See Lattimore v. Dubois, 311 F.3d 46, 55 (1st

Cir. 2002) (limited knowledge of the law and limited access to the courts do not in themselves

warrant application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel).

       In sum, Petitioner filed his section 2255 motion more than three years after the expiration

of the one-year limitation period, and the record lacks support for Petitioner’s equitable tolling

argument. Petitioner, therefore, cannot prevail on his motion.

                                         III.     CONCLUSION

       Based on the foregoing analysis, an evidentiary hearing is not warranted under Rule 8 of

the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings. Accordingly, I recommend that the Court deny

Petitioner’s motion for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. I further recommend that the Court

deny a certificate of appealability pursuant to Rule 11 of the Rules Governing Section 2255

Proceedings because there is no substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right within

the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).
