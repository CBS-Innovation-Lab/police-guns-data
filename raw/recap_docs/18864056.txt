                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 07-cr-187-PB

Jeffrey Lance Brown



                                  O R D E R

     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

May 6, 2008 trial in the above case, citing the need for

additional time to engage in plea negotiations or prepare for

trial.    The government does not object to a continuance of the

trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reason and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from May 6, 2008 to June 3, 2008.             In agreeing

to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ยง

3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the ends of

justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the best

interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
