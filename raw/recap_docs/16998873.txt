                 ORDER ON GOVERNMENT’S MOTION IN LIMINE

         Defendant Steven Lemieux may not open a predicate conviction to collateral

  attack at the upcoming trial for a firearms offense.

  I. Statement of Facts

         Steven Lemieux is charged in a two-count Indictment alleging that on two

  separate occasions in 2005 he knowingly made false statements to a firearms dealer

  intended to or likely to deceive the dealer for the purpose of buying a firearm, conduct in

  violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(a)(6). More specifically, the Government alleges that Mr.

  Lemieux answered “No”, to question 12.i. of a Department of the Treasury, Bureau of

  Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Firearms Transaction Record (ATF Form 4473), which

  reads as follows: “Have you ever been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic

  violence?”.   The Government anticipates that, contrary to this representation, the

  evidence will show that on February 4, 2004, the defendant was found guilty after trial in

  Maine Superior Court of assault in violation of 17-A M.R.S.A. § 207(1), that the victim

  of the assault was his wife, and that the defendant’s conviction was affirmed on January

  5, 2005 - one week before the first alleged violation.

         Having learned that the Defendant claims he is actually innocent of assaulting his

  wife, the Government filed a motion in limine to preclude “defense counsel from

  inquiring into the underlying factual basis for the defendant’s conviction for a

  misdemeanor crime of domestic violence (except for the fact that the victim was the

  defendant’s wife) and precluding the defendant from making any statement, spontaneous

  or otherwise, concerning his claim of innocence.”         See Gov.’s Mot. in Limine at 2

  (Docket # 17). Defendant objects. Def.’s Obj. to Gov.’s Mot. in Limine (Docket # 19).

  II. Discussion

         Section 922(a) provides that it shall be unlawful:

         (6) for any person in connection with the acquisition or attempted acquisition of
         any firearm or ammunition from a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer,
         licensed dealer, or licensed collector, knowingly to make any false or fictitious
         oral or written statement or to furnish or exhibit any false, fictitious, or
         misrepresented identification, intended or likely to deceive such importer,
         manufacturer, dealer, or collector with respect to any fact material to the
         lawfulness of the sale or other disposition of such firearm or ammunition under
         the provisions of this chapter.

  Id. (emphasis supplied). Jury instructions in the First Circuit have clarified that the

  Government need prove three elements: (1) that defendant knowingly made a false

  statement as charged in the Indictment; (2) that at the time he made the statement,

  defendant was trying to buy a firearm from a licensed firearm dealer; and, (3) that the

  statement was intended to, or likely to, deceive the licensed dealer about a fact material to

  the lawfulness of the sale. See Judge Hornby’s Revisions to the Pattern Criminal Jury

  Instructions for the District Courts of the First Circuit (2005) at § 4.18.922(a).

         Here, the gravamen of the Indictment was that the false statements on the firearms

  applications concerned his prior conviction. As such, the Government “bears the initial

  burden of showing that the defendant was indeed convicted of a predicate misdemeanor



                                                2

  offense….” United States v. Hartsock, 347 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2003). In Hartsock, for

  example, the Government carried its burden “by introducing a certified copy of

  Hartsock’s conviction for assault and by Hartsock’s stipulation that the assault involved

  domestic violence.” Id. Although the Defendant ma y raise the affirmative defense that

  the conviction falls within a statutory exception for which he has the burden of

  persuasion, id. at 7-9, there is nothing to suggest Mr. Lemieux’s objection to the

  conviction does so. He is also free to collaterally attack his conviction in another forum,

  see United States v. Snyder, 235 F.3d 42, 51-52 (1st Cir. 2000), but there is no suggestion

  he has done so.

         Instead, Mr. Lemieux asserts the right to claim during his trial on the pending

  charge that he was actually innocent of the predicate conviction. This he cannot do. The

  United States Supreme Court resolved this issue in Lewis v. United States, 445 U.S. 55

  (1980). Lewis expressly held that a “firearms prosecution does not open the predicate

  conviction to a new form of collateral attack.” Id. at 67. In Lewis, the Court upheld the

  use of a predicate conviction in a felon in possession case, despite the fact it “was

  uncounseled and therefore obtained in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment

  rights of the defendant….” See United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, 481 U.S. 828, 840

  (1987)(explaining Lewis); Snyder, 235 F.3d at 51-53 (conviction later vacated can still

  serve as a predicate conviction); United States v. Currier, 821 F.2d 52, 59-60 (1st Cir.

  1987)(Lewis extends to convictions while on appeal).

  II. Conclusion

         The Government’s motion in limine (Docket No. 17) is GRANTED. Defense

  counsel is prohibited from inquiring into the underlying factual basis for the defendant’s

  conviction for a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence (except for the fact that the

  victim was defendant’s wife), and, if he elects to testify, Defendant is precluded from

  making any statement concerning his claim of innocence of the conduct underlying the

  predicate offense.

         SO ORDERED.
