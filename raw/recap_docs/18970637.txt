                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                        DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                                   Criminal No. 10-cr-160-01-JD

Eric Arsenault


                                  O R D E R


     On March 4, 2011, the defendant appeared for a bail

revocation hearing pursuant to 18 U.S.C. ' 3148.

     The background is as follows: Defendant is charged with

Unlawful User in Possession of a Firearm in violation of 18

U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(3), and Making a False Statement During the

Acquisition of a Firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. ' 922(a)(6).

On December 2, 2010, defendant was released on bail following

his initial appearance in this court.

     The government alleges that since defendant's release on

bail in December, he has tested positive for heroin use on

numerous occasions despite having successfully completed a 30-

day in-patient treatment program and started an intensive out-

patient program.      The two violations before the court allege

that defendant tested positive for morphine/heroin on February

21, 2011, and failed to attend a counseling session on February

25, 2011.     The Office of Probation and Pretrial Services

maintains that this conduct violates conditions of bail as set

forth in its report dated March 2, 2011.        Prior positive drug

tests resulted in requests for "no action," both of which were

approved by the court, in an attempt to deal with defendant's

relapses with treatment rather than detention.

     A request to revoke bail is governed by 18 U.S.C. ' 3148,

which provides in part:

     The judicial officer shall enter an order of
     revocation and detention if, after a hearing, the
     judicial officer--

     (1) finds that there is-

          (A) probable cause to believe that the person has
          committed a Federal, State, or local crime while
          on release; or

          (B) clear and convincing evidence that the person
          has violated any other condition of release; and

     (2) finds that--

          (A) based on the factors set forth in section
          3142(g) of this title, there is no condition or
          combination of conditions of release that will
          assure that the person will not flee or pose a
          danger to the safety of any other person or the
          community; or

          (B) the person is unlikely to abide by any
          condition or combination of conditions of
          release.

18 U.S.C. ' 3148 (b)(1)-(2).     The government has the initial

burden to establish the violation under 18 U.S.C. ' 3148 (b)(1).

If the government establishes probable cause to believe the

defendant committed a new "felony" offense on release, a

rebuttable presumption arises that no condition or combination

of conditions will assure that the person will not pose a danger

to the safety of any other person or the community.          18 U.S.C. '

3148(b)(2).   Otherwise, the government typically has the burden

to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the requirements of

section 3148 (b)(2)(A) or (B).      Aron, 904 F.2d at 224; United

States v. Poinsett, 953 F. Supp. 37, 38 (N.D.N.Y. 1997).

    In this case, defendant conceded that the government had

sufficient evidence to establish probable cause that he violated

the conditions of his bail as charged.       Thus, the only question

before the court was whether to release the defendant.          For all

of the reasons stated on the record, the court finds that

defendant's drug addiction is so severe that he is unlikely to

abide by any conditions or combination of conditions of release.

Therefore, the conditions of release are revoked.

    Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the defendant be detained.

The defendant is committed to the custody of the Attorney

General or his designated representative for confinement in a

corrections facility separate, to the extent practicable, from

persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody

pending appeal.     The defendant shall be afforded a reasonable

opportunity for private consultation with defense counsel.             On

order of a court of the United States or on request of an

attorney for the government, the person in charge of the

corrections facility shall deliver the defendant to the United

States Marshal for the purpose of an appearance in connection

with a court proceeding.

      To the extent consistent with the jail's regulations, and

presuming that defendant qualifies for admission, the court

makes a recommendation that defendant be allowed entrance into

the Therapeutic Community Program, or the "T.C. Program," at the

Strafford County House of Corrections.

      SO ORDERED.
