               REPORT AND
           RECOMMENDATION
         ON MOTION TO VACATE,
    SET ASIDE, OR CORRECT SENTENCE
  PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (# 527)
     AND GOVERNMENT’S...REQUEST
    FOR SUMMARY DISMISSAL (# 550)
COLLINGS, U.S.M.J.
                                I. Introduction



      Petitioner/defendant Carlos Sanchez (“Sanchez” or “the petitioner”) seeks
to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 on the grounds of
ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing. In particular, Sanchez claims
that his trial counsel failed to apply for a safety-valve reduction on Sanchez’s
behalf, and failed to advise Sanchez properly on the availability of a safety-valve
reduction. The government moves to dismiss the petition summarily on the
grounds,     inter   alia, that Sanchez filed his petition outside the one-year
limitations period set out in 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f)(1) (limitations period runs
from “the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final”). Sanchez
concedes that he filed his petition well after his conviction became final, but
contends that the limitations period should begin running in his case on “the
date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have
been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.” . § 2255(f)(4). For
                                                                         Id



the reasons set out below, the Court recommends rejecting this argument and
dismissing the petition as untimely.1
                                   II. Factual Background



       The pertinent facts can be quickly summarized. After a ten-day trial, a
jury found Sanchez guilty of conspiring to distribute heroin. Sanchez was
sentenced on March 28, 2007 to 127 months incarceration. He filed a notice
of appeal on April 6, 2007. On November 7, 2008, he voluntarily moved to
       1

         The government also moves for summary dismissal on the merits. Given the Court’s recommended
disposition on timeliness grounds, the Court need not reach the alternative merits-based arguments.
                                                 2
dismiss the appeal “so that he might pursue a motion to vacate his sentence
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.” (# 528 at 3) The First Circuit granted his
motion on November 7, 2008. (# 474)
      On June 10, 2010, the petitioner filed his Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or
Correct Sentence Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (# 527), along with a
memorandum in support (# 528) and accompanying affidavits (## 529-531).
In the petition, Sanchez, who is represented by counsel, asserts a Sixth
Amendment claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. On October 22,
2010, the government filed a Response to Defendant’s Motion Pursuant to 28
U.S.C. § 2255 and Request for Summary Dismissal (# 550). The petitioner filed
a Reply to Government’s Response to Defendant’s Motion Pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
§ 2255 (# 552). The government, with leave, filed a Response to Defendant’s
Reply Memorandum (# 560), and the petitioner filed a Reply to Government’s
Timeliness Argument (# 564). The motion to vacate and the government’s
motion for summary dismissal are therefore poised for resolution.
                                  III. Discussion



      Sanchez asserts one claim in his petition, viz., that “[c]ounsel was
ineffective in that he failed to apply for a reduction of the petitioner’s sentence


                                        3
based on [USSG] § 5C2.1, and petitioner was prejudiced by this failure because,
but for the failings of counsel, he would have sought to interview with the
Government thereby meeting all five criteria for the safety-valve downward
departure.” (# 527 at 1) Without the safety-valve reduction, Sanchez was
subject to a ten-year statutory mandatory minimum. In support of his motion,
Sanchez avers that his trial counsel told him that he could qualify for a safety-
valve reduction only if Sanchez was “prepared to testify against other
individuals at trial.” (# 529 ¶ 17) Sanchez argues that this advice was wrong
because he could have qualified for the safety-valve reduction under USSG §
5C2.1(a)(5) by “engag[ing] in a proffer interview with the government.” (#
528 at 5) Sanchez further avers that he decided not to cooperate with the
government on the basis of his counsel’s incorrect advice because he feared the
harm that might befall him or his family if he were to testify against others. (#
529 ¶¶ 18-22)
      Sanchez concedes that he did not file his section 2255 petition within a
year of his conviction becoming final. Instead, he invokes 28 U.S.C. §
2255(f)(4) as the operative provision, which provides that the limitations period
begins to run on “the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims
presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.”
                                       4
In Sanchez’s view, the factual predicate underlying this claim “did not come to
light until it became clear on October 23, 2009, that [trial counsel] did not
know what he advised the defendant . . . with respect to the safety valve.” (#
552 at 1-2)
      This argument lacks merit. Sanchez himself learned the factual predicate
for the claim at the time that he and his trial counsel discussed whether Sanchez
was eligible for the safety valve: Sanchez surely knew how his trial counsel
advised him, and he knew the details of his conversations with counsel. That
Sanchez only later discovered the legal import of those discussions is insufficient
to satisfy this provision of the statute. See Barreto-Barreto v. United States, 551
F.3d 95, 100 n.4 (1st Cir. 2008) (“the discovery of a new legal theory does not
constitute a discoverable ‘fact’ for purposes of § 2255(f)(4)”); see also Wiseman
v. United States, 07-11539-MLW, 2010 WL 3749474, at *2 (D. Mass. Sept. 20,
2010) (“[B]ecause defendant was present when his attorney failed to object [at
sentencing], defendant knew or could have discovered the relevant facts at the
time of sentencing [under § 2255(f)(4)]. Defendant’s allegation that he only
recently recognized the legal significance of those facts is irrelevant.”); Phillips
v. Spencer, 477 F. Supp.2d 306, 311-312 (D. Mass. 2007) (“That [petitioner] did


                                         5
not allegedly discover until [three years after conviction became final] that his
trial counsel's advice was misleading and inaccurate is unfortunate but,
nevertheless, unavailing under the language of § 2244(d)(1)(D) [section 2254's
counterpart to section 2255(f)(4)].”).
      In a related argument, Sanchez suggests that First Circuit law required him
to bolster his habeas case before filing the petition, and that, therefore, he
attempted to amass his evidence–including anything his trial counsel could
remember–before filing his petition. (# 564 at 2) Sanchez’s habeas counsel
avers that Sanchez’s trial counsel failed to return his many phone calls as he
attempted to prepare the instant habeas petition. (# 531 ¶¶ 8, 9, 17) Sanchez
thus attributes the delay in filing the instant habeas petition to the difficulty his
habeas counsel experienced in gathering evidence to corroborate Sanchez’s
statements.
      This argument is unavailing. The habeas statute of limitations is not
extended “while a habeas petitioner gathers every possible scrap of evidence that
might, by negative implication, support his claim.” Flanagan v. Johnson, 154
F.3d 196, 199 (5th Cir. 1998) (rejecting argument that trial counsel’s affidavit
formed part of the factual predicate of petitioner’s suit where petitioner’s own


                                         6
affidavit set forth the legal and factual predicate of the claim); see also Johnson
v. McBride, 381 F.3d 587, 589 (7th Cir. 2004) (“A desire to see more information
in the hope that something will turn up differs from ‘the factual predicate of [a]
claim or claims’ for purposes of § 2244(d)(1)(D).”), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 926
(2005). Rather, the statute provides that “[u]nless the motion and the files and
records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief,”
28 U.S.C. § 2255(b), a petition will not be dismissed without further
development of the record, id. Although it is true that a habeas court may
dismiss a section 2255 claim without holding an evidentiary hearing if it
determines that the petitioner’s allegations “are merely conclusory, contradicted
by the record, or inherently incredible,” Owens v. United States, 483 F.3d 48, 57
(1st Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), it is not the case
that a petitioner’s affidavit, if credible and sufficiently detailed, would be
insufficient standing alone to make out a plausible claim for relief, especially if
nothing in the underlying record belied that claim. The Supreme Court has
itself set the standard:
            This was not a case where the issues raised by the
            motion were conclusively determined either by the
            motion itself or by the ‘files and records' in the trial
            court. The factual allegations contained in the

                                        7
                petitioner's motion and affidavit, and put in issue by the
                affidavit filed with the Government's response, related
                primarily to purported occurrences outside the
                courtroom and upon which the record could, therefore,
                cast no real light. Nor were the circumstances alleged of
                a kind that the District Judge could completely resolve
                by drawing upon his own personal knowledge or
                recollection.
Machibroda v. United States            , 368 U.S. 487, 494-495 (1962),                 cited in David v.



United States     , 134 F.3d 470, 478 (1st Cir. 1998) (noting that “[i]nferior courts
have routinely applied the             Machibroda            standard in determining the need for
evidentiary hearings on section 2255 motions”).2
        In short, trial counsel’s memory of how he advised Sanchez about the
safety valve has no bearing on when Sanchez himself could have discovered the
factual predicate of the underlying claim here. Indeed, at the district court’s
direction, trial counsel ultimately filed an affidavit (# 548) in which he

        David v. United States , 134 F.3d 470, 478 (1 Cir. 1998), on which petitioner relies, does not suggest
                                                    st


that an affidavit standing alone is necessarily insufficient. Rather, David makes clear that an affidavit must
contain the “[w]ho, what, when, where, and how details” in order to “place[] matters of ascertainable fact
at issue and...bolster[] the case for an evidentiary hearing.” Id.

                                                         8
contradicted Sanchez’s allegations.3 Thus, Sanchez’s case would have been no
stronger if Sanchez had been able to contact trial counsel earlier.                             Cf. United



States v. Pallotta    , 433 F.2d 594, 595 (1st Cir. 1970) (“[W]e do not find the failure
of counsel to recall the events alleged by defendant conclusive in this case.
Hearings are often required even when the officials involved or the witnesses
have presented affidavits directly contradicting petitioners' allegations.”).
                                            IV. Conclusion



        For all the above reasons, the Court recommends that the Government’s
...Request for Summary Dismissal (# 550) be ALLOWED, that the petitioner’s
Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255
(# 527) be DENIED, and that judgment to that effect enter forthwith.
                                V. Review by the District Judge



        The parties are hereby advised that any party who objects to this
recommendation must file a specific written objection thereto with the Clerk of
this Court within 14 days of the party’s receipt of this Report and
Recommendation. The written objections must specifically identify the portion

        Sanchez correctly observes that trial counsel’s affidavit appears to copy, without attribution, from
a criminal defense blog, and that trial counsel improperly suggests that these words constituted his memory
of events. The Court agrees that these facts render the affidavit questionable. Nevertheless, for the reasons
stated above, the affidavit, though suspect, has no bearing on the analysis.
