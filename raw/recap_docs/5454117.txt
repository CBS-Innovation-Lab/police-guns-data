STATEMENT OF REASONS

VH COURT DETERMINATIONS OF RESTITUTION
A m Restitution Not Applicable.
B Total Amount of Restitution:

C Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

1 m For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A_, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

2 m For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(B).
3 m For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guideiines, restitution is not
ordered because the complication and prolongation of tile sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh
the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(&)(1)(B)(ii).

4 [:I Restitution is not ordered for other reasons (E)cplain.)

D i:] Partial restitution is ordered for these reasons (18 U.S.C. § 3553(¢)):
