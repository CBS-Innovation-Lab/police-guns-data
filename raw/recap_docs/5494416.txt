                   GOVERNMENT’S SENTENCING MEMORANDUM

     The United States of America, by its attorneys, Michael J.

Sullivan, United States Attorney for the District of

Massachusetts, and William F. Bloomer, Assistant U.S. Attorney,

submits its Sentencing Memorandum with respect to Santiago Arroyo

("Arroyo").

INTRODUCTION

     The Statement of Offense Conduct is set forth in detail in

the Probation Department’s Pre-Sentence Report (“PSR”).           The

government will not repeat the extensive allegations here.

     On September 28, 2006, ARROYO pleaded guilty before the

Honorable Nathaniel M. Gorton to conspiracy to distribute or

possess with intent to distribute 1 kilogram or more of a mixture

or substance containing a detectable amount of heroin, a Schedule

I controlled substance, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1),

841(b)(1)(A) and 846. (Count I of the Superseding Indictment).

Arroyo also pleaded guilty to Count Two of the Superseding

Indictment, charging him with distribution of heroin (and aiding

and abetting same) on December 10, 2003, in Lowell,

Massachusetts.     A sentencing hearing has been scheduled for

January 10, 1007.1

GOVERNMENT’S POSITION

        The parties agree that ARROYO is responsible for at least

five, but less than 10 grams of heroin.                     His Base Level Offense

therefore is 14. ARROYO made the December 10, 2003 delivery of 9.9

grams       to    the   undercover   agent      who   had    ordered      it     from       his

codefendant, Reynaldo Rivera (“RIVERA”), at a price of $950. Based

upon information from a CI, RIVERA fired ARROYO soon after this

transaction.            No further drug buys or seizures were made from

ARROYO.          He was later arrested in Florida in June of 2005 after a

warrant had issued for his arrest in the present case.

        According to the PSR, ARROYO is a Criminal History Category I

and    is        therefore   safety-valve       eligible     under       §§     5C1.2       and



        1
      As this Court is aware, following a ten-day trial, a jury
returned guilty verdicts against five of the eleven codefendants
in this case -- Julio SANTIAGO, Juan NUNEZ, Carlos COLON, Jose
RODRIGUEZ, and Carlos SANCHEZ -- with respect to Count One of the
Superseding Indictment. The jury also found Julio SANTIAGO
guilty of the firearms offenses set forth in Count Seven, namely,
possession of firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking
crime, and possession of unregistered firearms, to wit:
silencers, (Count Eight). The jury further found that the
conspiracy as a whole was responsible for more than 1,000 grams
of heroin. With the exception of Enrique AGOSTO, the remaining
defendants -- Reynaldo RIVERA, Zuleima REYES, Edwin TORREZ, Jose
TORRADO, and Luis SANCHEZ -- have all pleaded guilty before the
Honorable Nathaniel M. Gorton to Counts One of the Superseding
Indictment. AGOSTO was severed from his co-defendants for
purposes of trial and the charges against him remain outstanding.
Jose TORRADO is the only defendant to have been sentenced in this
case.   On June 2, 2006, TORRADO pleaded guilty before the
Honorable Nathaniel M. Gorton to Count One of the Superseding
Indictment. He was sentenced that same date to a minimum
mandatory 60 months imprisonment and 4 years' supervised release.

                                            2

2D1.1(b)(7), provided that he satisfies criterion 5.2          Because his

Base Offense Level is lower than 16, a two-level adjustment for

acceptance of responsibility is warranted under § 3E1.1(a). If his

Total Offense Level is 12, ARROYO has a GSR of 10 to 16 month's

incarceration.   That calculation puts ARROYO squarely in Zone C of

the Sentencing Guidelines.      Under § 5C1.1(d), a minimum term of

imprisonment is satisfied under Zone C by (1) a sentence of

imprisonment, or (2) a sentence of imprisonment that includes a

term of supervised release with a condition that substitutes

community confinement or home detention according to the schedule

in subsection (e), provided that at least one-half of the minimum

term is satisfied by imprisonment.

     If he satisfies criterion 5 of § 5C1.2(a) prior to sentencing,

ARROYO's offense level is reduced by an additional two points (to

10), which sets his GSR at 6 to 12 month's incarceration.               That

calculation places ARROYO squarely in Zone B.        Under § 5C1.1(c), a

minimum term of imprisonment is satisfied under Zone B by (1) a

sentence of imprisonment, or (2) a sentence of imprisonment that

includes a term of supervised release with a condition that

substitutes community confinement or home detention according to

the schedule in subsection (e), provided that at least one month is

satisfied by imprisonment, or (3) a sentence of probation that



     2
      As of the date of this memorandum, ARROYO has not met this
requirement of safety-valve eligibility.

                                    3
     Case 1:04-cr-10336-NMG          Document 341    Filed 01/09/2007      Page 4 of 9



includes a condition or combination of conditions that substitute

intermittent confinement, community confinement, or home detention

for imprisonment according to the schedule in subsection (e).

       If ARROYO satisfies criterion 5 of § 5C1.2(a) prior to

sentencing, the government would recommend a term of imprisonment

of 6 months; 3 year's supervised release; and a fine within the

Guidelines Range, unless the court finds that ARROYO is not able

and, even with the use of a reasonable installment schedule, is not

likely to become able to pay a fine.                  Otherwise, the government

recommends a term of incarceration of 10 months to be followed by

3    year's   supervised       release     and   a   fine,    if    the    Court    deems

appropriate,      within       the    Guidelines     Range.        The    defendant      is

responsible for a $200 special assessment.

ROLE

       Arroyo    was    a     significant    participant      in    the     transaction

totaling 9.9 grams of heroin for which he is being held accountable

and he should not receive either a minimal or minor role reduction

under U.S.S.G. §3B1.2.               Role adjustments are “heavily dependent

upon the facts of the particular case.” U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2, n.3(C).

To     receive   any        reduction,      Arroyo    must     show       that     he    is

"substantially         less    culpable     than     the   average        participant."

U.S.S.G. §3B1.2, Application Note 3(A); see United States v. Lopez-

Gil, 965 F.2d 1124, 1131 (1st Cir. 1992)("defendant has burden of

proving entitlement to such a downward adjustment") citing United


                                             4

States v. Ocasio, 914 F.2d 330, 332 (1st Cir. 1990). Moreover, the

Guidelines caution that the minimal participant adjustment is to be

used "infrequently."

     Arroyo must not only show that he is less culpable than most

others involved in this particular offense, but that he is less

culpable than defendants charged in similar cases.               See United

States   v.    Ortiz-Santiago,    211      F.3d   146,    149    (1st     Cir.

2000)("defendant has the burden of proving that he is both less

culpable than most others involved in the offense of conviction and

less culpable than most other miscreants convicted of comparable

crimes.").    Recently, in United States v. Cao, No. 06-1224 (C.A. 1

(Me) December 15, 2006), the First Circuit affirmed the district

court's decision at sentencing not to give the defendant a role

reduction as a minor or minimal participant.              Even though the

defendant was less culpable than the leaders of the conspiracy,

"that is not enough: he was required to show that he was less

culpable than the average participant, a judgment normally made not

with statistics but by practical indicia like role, frequency, and

duration."    Id. at 4.

     Here, even assuming that defendant is less culpable than his

codefendants in this conspiracy scheme, Arroyo simply was not a

"minor" or "minimal" participant in the conduct for which he is

being held accountable: the delivery of approximately 10 grams of

heroin (commonly called a “finger”) to an undercover officer on


                                    5
     Case 1:04-cr-10336-NMG     Document 341   Filed 01/09/2007    Page 6 of 9



behalf    of    Reynaldo      Rivera.       Indeed,   if    anything      Arroyo

substantially participated in the charged criminal conduct by

delivering the heroin and accepting payment for the drug.                        It

therefore cannot be said that Arroyo is "less culpable than the

average participant" in a similar transaction.             See United States

v. Cao, supra.    Probation concurs in this judgment.             See PSR ¶ 135.

CREDIT FOR PRETRIAL RELEASE

      Arroyo seems to argue without citation to any authority that

he should receive some type of consideration under 18 U.S.C.

§3553(a) for residing at the Coolidge House for seven months during

pretrial release because he was unable to find living arrangements

suitable to the court. This argument is without merit. First, the

express language §3553(a) does not permit a court to consider the

impositions on restrictions of living arrangements in fashioning an

appropriate sentence.         In fact, §3553(a)(5)(A) instructs the court

to   consider    any   pertinent     policy    statement    “issued      by      the

Sentencing Commission pursuant to section 994(a) of Title 28,

United States Code . . .”, which incorporates the Sentencing

Guidelines.      See U.S.S.G. §1A1.1.          Turning to the Guidelines,

§4A1.2(b) defines “imprisonment” as “a sentence of incarceration.”

Courts have interpreted "imprisonment" under the guidelines not to

include time spent in types of confinement other than actual

incarceration in a penal institution.          See, e.g., United States v.

Serafini, 233 F.3d 758, (3rd Cir. 2000)(community confinement


                                        6
   Case 1:04-cr-10336-NMG     Document 341       Filed 01/09/2007   Page 7 of 9



cannot    be   substituted    for     imprisonment       for    fulfilling        the

requirement    that   a   portion     of   the   sentence      be   satisfied     by

imprisonment); United States v. Elkins, 176 F.3d 1016, 1019 (7th

Cir. 1999)("Imprisonment," in the context of the guidelines denotes

time actually served in a penal institution); United States v.

Jones, 107 F.3d 1147, 1165 (6th Cir. 1998) (holding that time spent

in home detention under the community alternatives to prison

program   cannot   count     as   a   "sentence     of   imprisonment"       under

§4A1.1(a)); United States v. Phipps, 68 F.3d 159, 162 (7th Cir.

1995) ("'Home detention' differs from 'imprisonment' throughout the

Guidelines' schema. It is not 'imprisonment' but is a 'substitute

for imprisonment.'")(quoting U.S.S.G. §5B1.4(b)(20)).                 Cf. Reno v.

Koray, 515 U.S. 50, 65 (1995) (holding that "the time respondent

spent at the Volunteers of America community treatment center while

'released' on bail pursuant to the Bail Reform Act of 1984 was not

'official detention' within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. §3585").3                     It

simply makes no sense legally or logically for Arroyo to receive

some type of credit, whether under §3553(a) or otherwise, towards

the calculation of his sentence simply because he was unable to

disassociate himself with a third-party custodian who had criminal

convictions.    See Docket Entry 06/30/05.




     3
      Similarly, §5C1.1 distinguishes between "imprisonment" and
"substitute punishments," such as intermittent confinement,
community confinement, and home detention. U.S.S.G. §5C1.1.

§3553(a) FACTORS

     Although the Guidelines are advisory now under Booker, there

is also no viable basis at this time for deviating from the

guideline range under 18 U.S.C. §3553(a) in the circumstances of

these cases.   Arroyo reports no significant physical impairments

(PSR ¶176).    He reports good mental and emotional health (PSR

¶178) and does not feel the need for psychological assistance

(PSR ¶181). Arroyo reports no history of substance abuse or

substance abuse treatment (PSR ¶183), although he describes

himself as a past "heavy smoker" of marijuana (PSR ¶184).              He is

a High School graduate and is skilled in construction (PSR ¶¶

187-188).

     In short, the PSR reflects nothing unusual or extraordinary

in Arroyo's background to justify taking him outside of the

heartland of cases already addressed by the Sentencing Guidelines

absent a motion by the government.         C.f., Koon v. United States,

518 U.S. 81, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 2047 (1996) (“[b]efore a departure

is permitted, certain aspects of the case must be found unusual

enough for it to fall outside the heartland of cases in the

Guideline”).   Arroyo chose to set sail on this course to deal

heroin and nothing in the current should steer him outside the

federal sentencing guideline range.        See United States v.

Thurston, No. 05-2271 (1st Cir. July 26, 2006) (discussing

Congressional goal of promoting national uniformity in
