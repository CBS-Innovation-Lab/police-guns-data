                      FINDINGS AFFECTING SENTENCING


      On January 19, 2016 the defendant Troy Jones pleaded guilty to

knowingly and intentionally conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to

distribute controlled substances containing cocaine and cocaine base in violation

of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841, 846. On June 30, 2016, I held a hearing to determine

whether Jones qualifies as a “career offender” under the United States

Sentencing Guidelines:

             A defendant is a career offender if (1) the defendant was at
             least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed
             the instant offense of conviction; (2) the instant offense of
             conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a
             controlled substance offense; and (3) the defendant has at
             least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence
             or a controlled substance offense.

U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 4B1.1(a).            It is undisputed that Jones

meets the first two criteria and, on the third, that he has at least one prior felony

conviction for a controlled substance offense. Revised Presentence Investigation

Report (“PSR”) at ¶ 27. It is the second qualifying prior felony conviction that is

disputed.   Jones has a New York State youthful offender adjudication for a
Case 2:15-cr-00010-DBH Document 161 Filed 07/13/16 Page 2 of 5                   PageID #: 612



controlled substance violation reflected in ¶ 26 of the PSR. If that qualifies as

an “adult conviction,” then Jones is a career offender. Jones argues that the

youthful offender adjudication in ¶ 26 does not constitute a “conviction” at all.

Def.’s Sentencing Mem. at 2-5 (ECF No. 154). In the alternative, he argued at

the hearing that even if it constitutes a “conviction,” it cannot be counted as an

“adult” conviction. The government disagrees. Gov’t’s Sentencing Mem. at 1-2

(ECF No. 155).

       “When the government seeks to prove a predicate offense for sentencing

purposes, it has an initial burden of establishing the existence of the conviction.”

United States v. Cordero, 42 F.3d 697, 701 (1st Cir. 1994). Because at the

hearing the only evidence on ¶ 26 was police reports (which the government had)

and two later New York state presentence reports (which the Probation Office

had),1 I granted the government’s request—over the defendant’s objection—for a

two-week extension to obtain more documentation relating to this offense. Now

the government has filed on ECF (under seal because of New York state court

sealing orders) what it says are certified court records from the Supreme Court

of the State of New York, Queens County. (ECF No. 160). These include the

Information in the case, which reveals that the crime in question was “criminal

sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree,” and that Jones committed the

offense on December 1, 2005. Since Jones’s date of birth is July 22, 1987, PSR

at 3, he was 18 when he committed the offense. The State Court Certificate of


1The first New York presentence report was drafted in preparation for sentencing the defendant’s
career offender predicate felony offense located at ¶ 27 that is not being challenged. The second
New York presentence report was drafted in preparation for sentencing the defendant on a
misdemeanor conviction located at ¶ 28.
                                                                                               2

Disposition reveals that on July 10, 2006, Jones “was adjudicated to be a

youthful offender and was sentenced for “criminal sale of a controlled substance

5th degree PL 220.31 00 DF (cocaine)” to one year in prison and one year of post-

release parole supervision.   The Certificate also states: “A youthful offender

adjudication is not a judgment of conviction for a crime or any other

offense . . . .” For purposes of this ruling, I assume that the government will

successfully admit into evidence at sentencing certified copies of the documents

it has filed on ECF.

      “[First Circuit] case law holds that ‘for purposes of the career offender

provisions, whether or not a state disposition constitutes a ‘conviction’ is

determined by reference to federal law and the Guidelines,’ not state law.” United

States v. Curet, 670 F.3d 296, 305 (1st Cir. 2012) (quoting United States v.

Lindia, 82 F.3d 1154, 1163 (1st Cir. 1996). Thus, the statement in the New York

Certificate of Disposition does not determine whether Jones’s 2006 adjudication

was a “conviction.” Commenting on its previous decision in United States v.

McGhee, 651 F.3d 153 (1st Cir. 2011), the Curet court stated: “In McGhee, there

was no dispute about whether the youthful offender adjudication was a

conviction; the dispute focused on whether it was an adult conviction. McGhee

accordingly held that state law is relevant to determining whether a conviction

is an adult conviction, not whether it is a conviction.” Curet, 670 F.3d at 305-

06 (emphasis in original).

      According to the First Circuit, what the federal Guidelines require is a

“guilt-establishing event” for determining whether there was a “countable

conviction” for career offender purposes. See United States v. Pierce, 60 F.3d
                                                                                 3
Case 2:15-cr-00010-DBH Document 161 Filed 07/13/16 Page 4 of 5                      PageID #: 614



886, 892 (1st Cir. 1995) (“Thus, there is a textual basis in the career offender

guidelines for concluding that a guilt-establishing event (such as a plea where a

defendant states that he does not wish to contest the charges), and not the formal

entry of an adjudicatory judgment, determines whether and when there has been

a countable ‘conviction.’”). Under New York law, a youthful offender adjudication

occurs only after a defendant has been found guilty of a felony. If the state judge

after receiving a presentence report decides to proceed to a youthful offender

adjudication, the judge vacates the conviction and then imposes the youthful

offender adjudication.2 N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law § 720.20(3). I conclude that Jones

was convicted (there is no dispute that it was a felony charge3) of a controlled

substance offense that he committed after he turned eighteen.

       My analysis does not end there. As McGhee teaches, I must also determine

whether Jones’s youthful offender adjudication can be “classified” as an “adult”

conviction. 651 F.3d at 158. The penultimate sentence of application note 1 of

Guidelines § 4B1.2, addressing whether a conviction should be classified as an

“adult” conviction, instructs: “A conviction for an offense committed at age

eighteen or older is an adult conviction.” The instruction is unambiguous. Here,



2 “‘Youthful offender finding’ means a finding, substituted for the conviction of an eligible youth,
pursuant to a determination that the eligible youth is a youthful offender.” N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law
§ 720.10(4). “Upon conviction of an eligible youth, the court must order a pre-sentence
investigation of the defendant. After receipt of a written report of the investigation and at the
time of pronouncing sentence the court must determine whether or not the eligible youth is a
youthful offender.” Id. § 720.20(1). “Upon determining that an eligible youth is a youthful
offender, the court must direct that the conviction be deemed vacated and replaced by a youthful
offender finding.” Id. § 720.20(3).
3 The New York statute for which the defendant was convicted, N.Y. Penal Law § 220.31, is

categorized by New York as a class D felony. Class D felonies in New York are punishable by up
to seven years imprisonment. Id. at § 70.00(2)(d). This penalty fits within the Guidelines
definition of a felony for purposes of § 4A1.2: “[A]ny federal, state, or local offense punishable by
death or a term of imprisonment exceeding one year, regardless of the actual sentence imposed.”
                                                                                                   4
Case 2:15-cr-00010-DBH Document 161 Filed 07/13/16 Page 5 of 5                     PageID #: 615



the government has evidence demonstrating that Jones was eighteen at the time

he committed the offense, and I have concluded above that Jones was

“convicted.”     I therefore do not look to New York state law on how it treats

youthful offenders.         Cf. Curet, 670 F.3d at 305 (“The [quoted sentence]

. . . provides that ‘[a] conviction for an offense committed at age eighteen or older

is an adult conviction,’ with no reference to state law.”). Because the Guidelines

require me to treat a defendant age eighteen at the time the offense was

committed as an adult, Jones’s youthful offender adjudication in New York

qualifies as a predicate career offender conviction,4 and he is a career offender.

       The case manager shall schedule a final sentencing date.

       SO ORDERED.

4 If Jones had been 17 at the time he committed the offense, the analysis would be different. The
next sentence of the application note states: “A conviction for an offense committed prior to age
eighteen is an adult conviction if it is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted.” U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 4B1.2
cmt. n.1. Under McGhee’s analysis, I might well conclude that the New York youthful offender
adjudication was not an “adult” conviction, despite other Circuit precedents that say it is. See,
e.g., United States v. Miller, 562 F. App’x 272, 308 (6th Cir. 2014); United States v. Francis, 480
F. App’x 8, 2 (2d Cir. 2012); United States v. Wallace, 663 F.3d 177, 181 (3d Cir. 2011).
