C Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):
l m For ol`t`enses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is nut ordered because the number of

2 |:] For ot`fenses For which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex

issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount ofthe victims' losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3}{B}.

3 |:| For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines restitution is not
