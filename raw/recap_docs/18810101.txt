10                       MAGISTRATE JUDGE'S REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
                             RE: RULE 11 PROCEEDINGS (PLEA OF GUILTY)
11
12   I.         Procedural Background
13              On June 13, 2012, a grand jury returned an indictment against Jorge Sánchez-López (hereinafter
14   referred to as “defendant”). (Docket No. 16.) The defendant has agreed to plead guilty to count one of
15   the indictment. Defendant also agreed to forfeit any firearms and ammunition involved in the
16   commission of said offense. Count one charges that on or about May 15, 2012, in the District of Puerto
17   Rico and within the jurisdiction of this court, defendant Jorge Sánchez-López did knowingly and
18   intentionally posses a firearm, that is, a Glock pistol, serial number MFL958 loaded with eighteen 9mm
19   rounds of ammunition, at a place that he knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, is a school zone,
20   all in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 922(q)(2)(A).
21   II.        Consent to Proceed Before a Magistrate Judge
22              On September 5, 2012, while assisted by counsel the defendant, by consent, appeared before the
23   undersigned in order to change his previous not guilty plea to a plea of guilty as to count one of the
24   indictment. In open court the defendant was questioned as to the purpose of the hearing being held and
25   was advised of: (a) the nature and purpose of the hearing; (b) the fact that all inquiries were to be
26   conducted under oath and that it was expected that his answers would be truthful; (c) the potential
27   consequences of lying under oath (such as a perjury charge); and (d) his right to have the change of plea
28   proceedings presided by a district judge instead of a magistrate judge. The defendant was also

 2   explained the differences between the appointment and functions of the two. The defendant consented
 3   to proceed before the undersigned magistrate judge.
 4   III.     Proceedings Under Rule 11, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure
 5            A.      Rule 11(c)(1) Requirements
 6                    Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure governs the acceptance of
              guilty pleas to federal criminal violations. Pursuant to Rule 11, in order for a plea of
 7            guilty to constitute a valid waiver of the defendant’s right to trial, guilty pleas must be
              knowing and voluntary: “Rule 11 was intended to ensure that a defendant who pleads
 8            guilty does so with an ‘understanding of the nature of the charge and consequences of
              his plea.’” United States v. Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting
 9            McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 467 (1969)). [There are three core concerns
              in these proceedings]: 1) absence of coercion; 2) understanding of the charges; and 3)
10            knowledge of the consequences of the guilty plea. United States v. Cotal-Crespo, 47
              F.3d at 4 (citing United States v. Allard, 926 F.2d 1237, 1244-45 (1st Cir. 1991)).

     United States v. Hernández-Wilson, 186 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1999).
12
              B. Admonishment of Constitutional Rights
13
              To assure defendant’s understanding and awareness of his rights, defendant was advised of his
14
     right:
15
              1.   To remain silent at trial and be presumed innocent, since it is the government who has the
16
     burden of proving his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
17
              2.   To testify or not to testify at trial, and that no adverse inference could be made in relation
18
     to his decision not to testify.
19
              3.   To a speedy trial before a district judge and a jury, at which he would be entitled to see and
20
     cross examine the government witnesses, present evidence on his behalf, and challenge the
21
     government’s evidence.
22
              4.   To have a unanimous verdict rendered by a jury of twelve persons which would have to be
23
     convinced of defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt by means of admissible evidence.
24
              5.   To use the subpoena power of the court to compel the attendance of witnesses.
25
              Upon listening to the defendant’s responses, observing his demeanor and his speaking with his
26
     attorney, that to the best of counsel’s belief defendant had fully understood his rights, it is determined
27
     that defendant is aware of his constitutional rights.

 2               C. Consequences of Pleading Guilty
 3               Upon advising defendant of his constitutional rights, he was further advised of the consequences
 4 of pleading guilty. Specifically, defendant was advised that by pleading guilty and upon having his
 5 guilty plea accepted by the court, he will be giving up the above rights and will be convicted solely on
 6 his statement that he is guilty.
 7               Furthermore, the defendant was admonished of the fact that by pleading guilty he would not be
 8 allowed later on to withdraw his plea because he eventually might disagree with the sentence imposed,
 9 and that if he violates the conditions of supervised release, that privilege could be revoked and he could
10 be required to serve an additional term of imprisonment. He was also explained that parole has been
11 abolished.
12               In response to further questioning, defendant was explained and he understood that if convicted
13 on count one he will face the following penalties: a term of imprisonment of not more than five (5) years,
14 a fine not to exceed $100,000.00, and a term of supervised release of not more than one (1) year.1
15               The defendant was also explained what the supervised release term means. Defendant was also
16 made aware that the court must impose a mandatory penalty assessment of one hundred dollars ($100)
17 per offense pursuant Title 18, United States Code, Section 3013(a).
18               The defendant was advised that the ultimate sentence was a matter solely for the court to decide
19 in its discretion and that, even if the maximum imprisonment term and fine were to be imposed upon
20 him, he later could not withdraw his guilty plea for that reason alone. The defendant understood this.
21               D. Plea Agreement2
22               The parties have entered into a written plea agreement that, upon being signed by the
23 government, defense attorney and defendant, was filed and made part of the record. Defendant was
24
25
26           1
                        Section 924(a)(4) of Title 18 of the United States Code provides in its pertinent part: “Except for the
     authorization of a term of imprisonment of not more than 5 years made in this paragraph, for the purpose of any other law
27   a violation of section 922(q) shall be deemed a a misdemeanor.”

28           2
                       “Plea agreement” refers to the agreement and its supplement.

 2 clearly warned and recognized having understood that the sentencing guidelines contained in the plea
 3 agreement are advisory and thus, not mandatory or binding on the court.
 4           E. Government's Evidence (Basis in Fact)
 5           The government presented a proffer of its evidence consistent with the version of facts of the plea
 6 agreement with which the defendant concurred. Accordingly, it is determined that there is a basis in fact
 7 and evidence to establish all the elements of the offense charged.
 8           F. Voluntariness
 9           The defendant accepted that no threats had been made to induce him to plead guilty and that he
10 did not feel pressured to plead guilty.
11           G. Waiver of Appeal
12           The defendant was explained, and he understood, that if the court accepts the plea agreement and
13 sentences him according to its terms and conditions, he will be surrendering his right to appeal the
14 sentence and judgment in this case.
15   IV.     Conclusion
16           The defendant, by consent, has appeared before me pursuant to Rule 11, Federal Rules of
17 Criminal Procedure, has entered a plea of guilty as to count one of the indictment. After cautioning and
18 examining the defendant under oath and in open court, concerning each of the subject matters mentioned
19 in Rule 11, as described in the preceding sections, I find that defendant is competent to enter this guilty
20 plea, is aware of the nature of the offense charged and the maximum statutory penalties that the same
21 carries, understands that the charge is supported by the government’s evidence, has admitted to every
22 element of the offense charged, and has done so in an intelligent and voluntary manner with full
23 knowledge of the consequences of his guilty plea. Therefore, I recommend that the court accept the
24 guilty plea of the defendant and that the defendant be adjudged guilty as to count one of the indictment.
25           Any objections to this report and recommendation must be specific and must be filed with the
26 Clerk of Court within fourteen (14) days of its receipt. Failure to timely file specific objections to the
