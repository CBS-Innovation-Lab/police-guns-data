                        ORDER AFFIRMING THE
             RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE


       The United States Magistrate Judge filed with the Court on March 30, 2017, his

Recommended Decision (ECF No. 49). Petitioner filed his Objection to the Recommended

Decision (ECF No. 50) on April 12, 2017. Respondent Government filed its Response to

Petitioner’s Objection to Recommended Decision (ECF No. 53) on April 26, 2017.

       I have reviewed and considered the Magistrate Judge's Recommended Decision, together

with the entire record; I have made a de novo determination of all matters adjudicated by the

Magistrate Judge's Recommended Decision; and I concur with the recommendations of the United

States Magistrate Judge for the reasons set forth in his Recommended Decision, and determine

that no further proceeding is necessary.

       1.      It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the Magistrate Judge
               is hereby AFFIRMED.

       2.      It is hereby ORDERED that Petitioner’s motion for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C.
               § 2255 (ECF No. 38) is DENIED.
       3.     It is hereby ORDERED that a certificate of appealability shall be granted pursuant
              to Rule 11 of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Cases.
