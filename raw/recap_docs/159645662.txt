                                  ORDER
WOLF, D.J.                                                April 11, 2013

     Defendant Darwin Jones has moved to vacate his conviction, by
guilty plea, because the sole evidence that the substance alleged
to be a controlled substance that he possessed with intent to
distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. ยง841(a)(1) was a certificate
issued by chemist Annie Dookhan, who is now being prosecuted for
alleged misconduct in performing tests of seized substances.           In
response to an April 4, 2013 Order, the parties have reported that:
     1.      The Motion to Vacate.
     The government has reviewed the facts of this case and
     based on the involvement of Annie Dookhan, the absence of
     any untested drugs, and other surrounding circumstances,
     does not oppose that Motion to Vacate and the entry of an
     order vacating the June 6, 2009 Judgment of Conviction.

     2.      Pending Supervised Release Revocation Matters

     The government has consulted with Probation regarding the
     impact of the allowance of the Motion to Vacate on any
     pending supervised release revocation matters. Both the
     government and Probation believe that, upon allowance of
     the Motion to Vacate, all supervised release matters
     should be dismissed as well.     The defendant does not
     object to the dismissal of these matters.

     In view of the foregoing, the parties believe that it is
     unnecessary for the Court to conduct the hearing
     scheduled for April 15 and jointly request (with
     Probation's assent) that the hearing be cancelled.
