                                              ORDER



       This matter came before me this date for a preliminary hearing pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P.

32.1(a)(1). The probationer appeared with counsel and waived his right to a preliminary hearing.

Accordingly, I FIND probable cause to hold the probationer for a revocation hearing.

       The probationer offered no evidence or other information to satisfy his burden of establishing

that he will not flee or pose a danger to any other person or to the community. See Fed. R. Crim. P.

32.1(a)(6) and 18 U.S.C. ยง 3143(a). He must, therefore, be DETAINED pending the outcome of the

revocation hearing.

       The probationer is committed to the custody of the Attorney General or his designated

representative for confinement in a corrections facility separate, to the extent practicable, from

persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody pending appeal. The probationer shall

be afforded a reasonable opportunity for private consultation with his counsel. On order of a court of

the United States or on request of an attorney for the government, the person in charge of the

corrections facility shall deliver the probationer to the United States Marshal for the purposes of an

appearance in connection with a court proceeding.

       Dated this 17th day of October, 2005.
