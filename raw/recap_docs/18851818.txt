                   UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                        DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIR E


United States of America

              V.                             Case No . 07-cr-115-01-SM

Daniel Carl Hicks

                                    ORDER

       Defendant Hicks' motion to continue the final pretrial conference and tria l

is granted (document 9) . Trial has been rescheduled for the July 2008 trial

period . Defendant Hicks shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights not later than

February 4, 2008 . On the filing of such waiver, his continuance shall be

effective .

       The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18

U.S .C . ยง 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would

unreasonably deny defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances .

       Final Pretrial Conference : June 25, 2008 at 10 :00 a .m.

       Jury Selection : July 8, 2008 at 9 :30 a.m .
