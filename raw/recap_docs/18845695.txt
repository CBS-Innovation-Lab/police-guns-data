                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                       DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

             v.                              Case No. 07-cr-148-01-SM

Eric L. Savage

                                    ORDER

      Defendant Savage’s motion to continue the final pretrial conference and

trial is granted (document 13). Trial has been rescheduled for the February

2008 trial period. Defendant Savage shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights not

later than December 3, 2007. On the filing of such waiver, his continuance

shall be effective.

      The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial,

18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would

unreasonably deny defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances.

      Final Pretrial Conference: January 30, 2008 at 3:30 p.m.

      Jury Selection: February 5, 2008 at 9:30 a.m.
