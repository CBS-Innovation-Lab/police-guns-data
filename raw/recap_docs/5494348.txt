Re: Luis Sanchu

To Whom It May Concern:

l would like to say that my husband s a wonderful person. He is very a smart man who
works hard for what he wants When l met my husband we were both living in Puerto
Rico. l had just moved there with my parents He was working on a sugar cane
plantation He played baseball and Disc Jockey while working on plantation During our
courtship l never got any impression that he was a bad person and l sill feel that way. I-Ie

has been an excellent father and husband. He has been missed greatly.

Yours Truly,
