                                       ORDER

WILLIAM E. SMITH, United States District Judge.

     The    above    captioned      matter    is   a    Motion     under    28   U.S.C.

§ 2255 to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence by a Person in

Federal Custody (ECF No. 203) filed by Petitioner Domingo A.

Gonzalez,    in     which    he    alleges    that      his   trial     counsel    was

ineffective due, in part, to a conflict of interest.                          Gonzalez

has included an affidavit in further support of his allegations.

            The     Court    has     determined        that   an    affidavit     from

Petitioner’s trial counsel is necessary to decide the Motion.

Accordingly, the Government is directed to obtain and submit an

affidavit from Robert B. Mann, Esq.

     Counsel’s affidavit should address the following questions:

            1.      What    is    counsel’s   recollection         of   a   post-trial

            conversation with Petitioner, if any, in which counsel

            allegedly told Petitioner that counsel had a conflict
          of interest based on his prior representation of Lisa

          Torres;

          2.    Was counsel aware of an alleged actual conflict

          of   interest    during    Petitioner’s          trial   due   to    his

          previous representation of Ms. Torres;

          3.    If so, did said alleged conflict affect counsel’s

          representation    of    Petitioner     in    any    way,    including,

          but not limited to:

                a)     raising arguments regarding Ms. Torres;

                b)     disclosing exculpatory evidence;

                c)     contradicting     the   Government’s          version   of

                the    evidence     pertaining        to    the    wiretap     and

                telephone records or developing the record with

                respect thereto;

                d)     cross-examining     the    Government’s         witnesses

                more zealously; and

          4.    Did counsel contemplate calling Ms. Torres as a

          defense witness and, if so, why did he not do so.

     Said affidavit shall be filed within twenty-one days of the

date of this order.

IT IS SO ORDERED:
