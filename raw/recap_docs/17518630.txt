B Total Amount of Restitution:

___________-__

C Restitution not ordered (Cheek only one.):

l [3 For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under |8 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under l8 U.S C § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

2 i:i For ot’t"enses for which resolution is otherwise mandatory under lB U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
issues offact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to an).i victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under lS U.S C § 3663A(c)(3)(B)
3 m For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S C § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines restitution is not
ordered because the complication and prolongation ot` the sentencing process resulting from the Fashioning of a restitution order outweigh

the need to provide restitution to any victims under lB U S.C § 366J(a)(l){B){ii).
