     MOTION TO DISMISS INDICTMENT AS THE STATUTE CHARGED VIOLATED
                         THE SECOND AMENDMENT

           After the Supreme Court‟s decision in District of Columbia v. Heller, the Court

concludes that the law prohibiting persons who have been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of

domestic violence survives Second Amendment scrutiny.1

I.         STATEMENT OF FACTS

           On January 16, 2008, a federal grand jury indicted Russell E. Booker for two counts of

possession of a firearm by a person previously convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic

violence, a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9). Indictment (Docket # 1). On March 28, 2008,

Mr. Booker moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming that the statute under which he was

charged violated the Second Amendment. Mot. to Dismiss Indictment as the Statute Charged

was Enacted in Violation of the United States Constitution (Docket # 36) (Def.’s Mot.). On June

6, 2008, the Court denied the motion on stare decisis grounds, noting that binding precedent

established that the Second Amendment conferred a collective, not an individual right to bear

arms. Order on Third Mot. to Dismiss Indictment (Docket # 54). On June 26, 2008, the United

States Supreme Court decided the seminal case of District of Columbia v. Heller in which the

Court concluded that the Second Amendment guarantees “the individual right to possess and

carry weapons in case of confrontation.” Heller, 128 S. Ct. at 2797. On June 27, 2008, Mr.

Booker moved for reconsideration of his motion in light of Heller. Mot. to Reconsider Order

Denying Mot. to Dismiss Indictment as the Statute Charged Violates the Second Amendment

(Docket # 57) (Mot. to Rec.).

II.    DISCUSSION

       Heller requires a different path to the same result. Prior case law suggested that the

Second Amendment did not encompass an individual right to bear arms and, therefore, the

statutory restriction on Mr. Booker‟s possession of firearms did not implicate a constitutional

right. Heller, however, clarified that the Second Amendment does guarantee an individual right

to bear arms and, as 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9) restricts that right, Heller requires that the Court

determine whether this statutory restriction passes constitutional muster.

       Heller left unanswered a significant question: The level of scrutiny the Court must apply

to the restriction on Mr. Booker‟s individual right to bear arms.            As Heller notes, the

“traditionally expressed levels” are “strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, and rational basis.”

Heller, 128 S. Ct. at 2821. The Heller majority acknowledged that it did not establish “a level of

scrutiny for evaluating Second Amendment restrictions,” but it left some hints. Id. First, the

Heller majority rejected Justice Breyer‟s “interest-balancing” approach, observing that it knew

“no other enumerated constitutional right whose core protection has been subjected to a

freestanding „interest-balancing‟ approach.” Id. Second, the majority conceded that the District

of Columbia law would pass rational-basis scrutiny and, since it ruled the District‟s complete ban

on handguns unconstitutional, the necessary implication is that the rational-basis test is not

applicable. Id. at 2818 n.27. The remaining options are strict and intermediate scrutiny.

       Strict scrutiny is generally reserved for statutory restrictions that affect the exercise of

certain “fundamental right[s].” Kadrmas v. Dickinson Pub. Sch., 487 U.S. 450, 458 (1988). The

individual right to bear arms might well be a fundamental right, the restriction of which requires

strict scrutiny. This conclusion is supported by the placement of Second Amendment within the

Bill of Rights alongside this Country‟s most precious freedoms. See San Antonio Indep. Sch.

Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 35 (1973) (noting that “[e]ducation, of course, is not among the

rights afforded explicit protection under our Federal Constitution.”). However, as Justice Breyer

points out, Heller expressly approves some statutory restrictions – the types of people who may

exercise this freedom; the places where this freedom may be exercised; and, the ability to buy

and sell the objects of this freedom – “whose constitutionality under a strict scrutiny standard

would be far from clear.” Heller, 128 S. Ct. at 2851. “Intermediate scrutiny is used, for

discrimination based on gender and for discrimination against nonmarital children.” Erwin

Chemerinsky, Constitutional Law Principles and Policies at 645 (2nd Ed. 2002). Heller itself

concedes that it does not “clarify the entire field.” Heller, 128 S. Ct. at 2821. It consciously left

the appropriate level of scrutiny for another day. Id. (stating that “there will be time enough to

expound upon the historical justifications for the exceptions we have mentioned if and when

those exceptions come before us.”).

       Rather than tackle this complex and unanswered question, the Court starts from a

different place.   Heller teaches that even though the Second Amendment guarantees an

individual right to bear arms, it is “not unlimited.” Id. at 2816. Heller states that “nothing in our

opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms

by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such

as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the



                                                 3
Case 1:08-cr-00019-JAW Document 62 Filed 08/11/08 Page 4 of 5                                       PageID #: 237



commercial sale of arms.” Id. at 2816-17. A useful approach is to ask whether a statutory

prohibition against the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill is similar enough to

the statutory prohibition against the possession of firearms by persons convicted of the

misdemeanor crime of domestic violence to justify its inclusion in the list of “longstanding

prohibitions” that survive Second Amendment scrutiny.

         The Court concludes it does. To reach this conclusion, the Court starts by comparing the

constitutionally-sanctioned prohibition against firearm possession by felons with the prohibition

against persons convicted of misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence. A person can, of course,

be convicted of a felony which had nothing to do with physical violence and which would not

necessarily predict future misuse of a firearm. Nevertheless, the law forbids any convicted felon,

regardless of the nature of the felony, from possessing firearms and Heller constitutionally

sanctioned this broad prohibition.2 See 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) (stating “[i]t shall be unlawful for

any person (1) who has been convicted in any court, of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a

term exceeding one year . . . to . . . possess . . . any firearm”).

         By contrast, the predicate offense under which Mr. Booker was convicted is defined in 18

U.S.C. § 922(g)(9) as requiring “the use or attempted use of physical force” by someone who is a

spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim or someone in a position similar to a spouse, parent, or




2
  The same point is generally applicable to the mentally ill. Under § 922(g)(4), the law prohibits firearm possession
by anyone “who has been adjudicated as a mental defective and who has been committed to a mental institution.”
18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(4). In Dickerson., the Supreme Court stated Congress‟s intent in enacting § 922(g) was “to keep
firearms out of the hands of presumptively risky people.” Dickerson v. New Banner Inst., Inc., 460 U.S. 103, 112
n.6 (1983); United States v. Holt, 464 F.3d 101, 103-04 (1st Cir. 2006). Heller obviated the question of whether
such a presumption restricting an individual‟s right to possess firearms would pass constitutional muster.
         Holt points out that there is a statutory provision that ameliorates the harshness of the statute‟s prohibitions
by allowing a person under one of the statutory disabilities to petition the Attorney General to restore the right to
possess a firearm. 18 U.S.C. § 925(c); Holt, 464 F.3d at 103-04. On the other hand, Congress has prohibited the use
of appropriated funds for investigating and acting on such petitions since 1992. Pickering-George v. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Civ. No. 07-8999 (RJL), 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12938, at *2 (D.D.C.
Feb. 21, 2008); Black v. Snow, 272 F. Supp. 2d 21, 22 (D.D.C. 2003).

guardian of the victim.3 18 U.S.C. § 921(33)(A)(ii); see United States v. Nason, 269 F.3d 10, 16

(1st Cir. 2001) (stating that “physical force may be characterized as power, violence, or pressure

directed against another person‟s body”); Order on Mot. to Dismiss Indictment at 2-3 (Docket #

52) (Order). If anything, as a predictor of firearm misuse, the definitional net cast by § 922(g)(9)

is tighter than the net cast by § 922(g)(1). Turning to the governmental interest, the manifest

need to protect the victims of domestic violence and to keep guns from the hands of the people

who perpetrate such acts is well-documented and requires no further elaboration. See Order at

12-15.

         Based on the absence of a meaningful distinction between felons and persons convicted

of crimes of domestic violence as predictors of firearm violence, the critical nature of the

governmental interest, and the definitional tailoring of the statute, the Court concludes that

persons who have been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence must be added

to the list of “felons and the mentally ill” against whom the “longstanding prohibitions on the

possession of firearms” survive Second Amendment scrutiny. Heller, 128 S. Ct. at 2816-17.

         The Court DENIES the Defendant‟s Motion to Reconsider Order Denying Motion to

Dismiss Indictment as the Statute Charged Violates the Second Amendment (Docket # 57).

  Mr. Booker emphasizes that an individual may be convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence in
Maine by reckless behavior; he argues that there is not a significant enough government interest to deprive him of
his Second Amendment right if he acted only recklessly. Mot. to Rec. However, the felony convictions to which
Mr. Booker‟s predicate offence is being compared run the gamut of the mens rea spectrum, and a domestic violence
offender‟s mens rea does not impact the Court‟s analysis under Heller.
