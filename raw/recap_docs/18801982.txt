                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                         DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                   Criminal No. 03-cr-221-01-JD

Adam Whitehead


                                  O R D E R

     On December 14, 2006, defendant appeared for a “probable

cause” hearing under Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.1 on several alleged

violations of conditions of supervision.           Defendant waived his

right to a probable cause hearing on the violations.             I therefore

find probable cause to hold him for a revocation hearing.

     Defendant sought bail conditions under Rule 32.1(a)(6).

Under Rule 32.1(a)(6) defendant bears the burden of establishing

by clear and convincing evidence that he will not flee and that

he poses no danger to any other person or to the community.

Defendant failed to call in for thirteen random urine

surveillance, has tested dirty for drug use twice and failed to

enter a mandated pain management program.           Continuing illegal

drug use makes him a danger to the community.            There are no

conditions which are likely to assure his presence and the safety

of the community.

     Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the defendant be detained

pending trial.

      The defendant is committed to the custody of the Attorney

General or his designated representative for confinement in a

corrections facility separate, to the extent practicable, from

persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody

pending appeal.     The defendant shall be afforded a reasonable

opportunity for private consultation with defense counsel.             On

order of a court of the United States or on request of an

attorney for the government, the person in charge of the

corrections facility shall deliver the defendant to the United

States Marshal for the purpose of an appearance in connection

with a court proceeding.

      SO ORDERED.
