                            November 5, 2010

Saris, U.S.D.J.

     Defendant Anthony Bates has moved to suppress a gun and all

other evidence seized during a warrantless search of his person

and backpack on September 29, 2009.       Among other things, the

government argues that all of the facts available to the police

at the time of the stop gave them reasonable suspicion that Mr.

Bates was engaged in criminal activity, and that police legally

seized the weapon when they felt it through the defendant’s

backpack.   A hearing was held on September 14, 2010 and September

16, 2010.   Boston Police Officers Vincent Stancato and Keith

Tolland testified for the government, and the Defendant Anthony

Bates testified on his own behalf.       The MOTION TO SUPPRESS is

DENIED.

                          I.    BACKGROUND FACTS

     On September 21, 2009 a woman called 911 to report a man

with a gun.    The woman told the 911 operator that she was at 17
         Case 1:09-cr-10357-PBS Document 35 Filed 11/05/10 Page 2 of 25



Carney Court in Charlestown and that “my mother called me, my

niece was coming over my mother’s with the baby and her

boyfriend, I think he has a gun in his backpack.” (Tr. of 911

Call.)    When asked “why do you think he has [a gun]?” the caller

responded: “Because somebody told me, they think that he has

one.” (Id.)

     The caller went on to provide identifying characteristics

about the man, including that he was Black, 5'2" with braids, and

that he was wearing all black with a blue backpack.            She also

reported that she thought the man had a warrant.           After

consulting with her mother, who is barely audible on a recording

of the call, the caller stated that the man was 24 years old and

named Anthony Bates. (Id.)

     The caller also provided information about the man’s

location.    Early on in the call she reported that he was on the

street and walking toward a laundromat.          Later, she told the

operator that the man was on the corner of Monument Street and

the “main road that runs off Monument,” and that he was heading

toward Sullivan Station where she guessed that he would take the

train back home to Attleboro. (Id.)         Then she said that he had

changed directions before stopping in front of the “United

National Market,” where he was smoking a cigarette. (Id.)

Finally, she reported that the police had arrived and that the

man was fleeing from officers while they followed after him.

(Id.) Throughout this final part of the call, the caller seemed

                                       2
      Case 1:09-cr-10357-PBS Document 35 Filed 11/05/10 Page 3 of 25



panicked and eager to provide police with information about the

man’s whereabouts.

     The operator never asked the caller her name.         But

throughout the call, the caller provided identifying information.

She told the operator that she was currently at 17 Carney Court

in Charlestown and that she was the aunt of the man’s girlfriend.

Twice she stated that she was from Revere.       The operator also

obtained other identifying information including the woman’s cell

phone number, which she entered into the CAD system, through

which it was ultimately relayed to the police.

     As the call was in progress, police officers began to

receive information about the tip over the radio from dispatch

and through the CAD system, which provides a short written

synopsis of the relevant information and is visible on the

computers in police vehicles.     Responding officers included

Officer Vincent Stancato and Robert Muller in a marked police

vehicle; Officer Keith Tolland in another vehicle; and Officer

John Breen, who was performing a police detail nearby.           While

driving, Officers Stancato and Muller saw someone fitting the

description given by the caller on the corner of Monument Street

and Bunker Hill Street.    The man was the defendant in this case,

Anthony Bates.   The officers parked their car across the street

from the defendant, from which point his head and shoulders were

visible to them.   They exited their vehicle, identified

themselves and approached him with their guns drawn, ordering him

                                    3
         Case 1:09-cr-10357-PBS Document 35 Filed 11/05/10 Page 4 of 25



to drop to the ground.       The defendant turned and began running.

Officer Stancato returned to the police car to drive after the

defendant, while Officer Muller followed him on foot.            Officers

Breen and Tolland joined the pursuit.           The police ultimately

caught up to the defendant just after he turned off of Beacon

Hill Street onto Concord Avenue.           Officers once again ordered the

defendant to the ground, and this time he complied.

     There is considerable dispute over how and when the officers

ultimately discovered the defendant’s firearm.           Officers Breen

and Tolland claim that they easily felt the barrel and identified

it as part of a firearm as they grabbed the backpack to take it

off the defendant’s back.1       After removing the backpack, the

officers opened it, and found what they again perceived to be a

gun wrapped in a thin cloth.        They testified that the gun was

positioned in the backpack in front of a plastic divider with its

barrel pointing up.      They removed the cloth to reveal the

firearm.

     The police report written by Officer Stancato describes a

less clear order of events.        It states:

     Officer J. Breen & Officer K. Tolland from the Ak01F
     car, removed the blue backpack from the suspect,
     effectively separating the suspect from the possible
     weapon. Officers noted that the backpack was heavy and
     there appeared to be what felt like a weapon inside.

     1
        At the hearing, the Court felt the backpack with the gun
positioned with the barrel pointing up as Officers Breen and
Tolland described and easily felt the weapon when touching the
outside of the bag.

                                       4
        Case 1:09-cr-10357-PBS Document 35 Filed 11/05/10 Page 5 of 25



     Officer Tolland & Breen opened the blue backpack and
     observed a heavy object wrapped in a black cloth inside
     the backpack and upon feeling the black cloth bag the
     officers felt a long hard solid object which based upon
     the officers experience, appeared to be the barrel of a
     handgun. (Ex. 7.)

While this narrative is unclear on the precise chronology, it

suggests that the officers felt the weapon just after the man was

separated from the backpack.

     The defendant’s testimony did not address when the police

officers discovered the weapon, but it did describe a different

orientation of the gun within the bag.         The defendant claims that

the gun was wrapped in the cloth and positioned behind the

plastic divider with the barrel pointing down.          When the gun was

positioned in this manner, the Court could not feel it while

touching the outside of the backpack.

     The Court finds that officers Breen and Tolland felt the

weapon as they were removing the backpack from the defendant’s

back.   It is not clear if the backpack was still on the

defendant’s back or if it had just been removed when officers

first felt the gun, but either way they felt it during the scrum,

when the defendant was still in close proximity to the bag and

the weapon.    The Court also finds that the gun was likely

positioned in front of the clear plastic divider, not behind it

as the defendant testified.       Thus, even if the gun’s barrel were

pointed downward, the officers would still have been able to feel

the weapon through the backpack’s exterior.         The firearm at issue


                                      5
      Case 1:09-cr-10357-PBS Document 35 Filed 11/05/10 Page 6 of 25



in this case is large and the backpack the defendant was carrying

it in is quite small.    It would have been difficult for officers

not to feel the gun through the bag while removing it from the

defendant.

     After discovering the weapon, the officers placed the

defendant under arrest.    He proved to have had a warrant out for

his arrest issued by Taunton District Court on August 6, 2009 for

motor vehicle offenses.

                           II.   DISCUSSION

     The Supreme Court has held that when a police officer makes

a “brief investigatory stop[] of [a] person[] [or] vehicle[] that

fall[s] short of traditional arrest . . . the Fourth Amendment is

satisfied if the officer’s action is supported by reasonable

suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.” United States v.

Montiero, 447 F.3d 39, 43 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting United States

v. Arvizu, 534 U.S. 266, 273 (2002)) (internal quotation marks

omitted).    When law enforcement officers perform a “Terry stop”,

they do not need a warrant, but they must “be able to point to

specific and articulable facts which, taken together with

rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant [the]

intrusion.” Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 21 (1968).         The officers

may draw on their experience and training in forming beliefs

about the subject of a stop, Montiero, 447 F.3d at 43 (citing

Arvizu, 534 U.S. at 273), but “subjective good faith” and



                                    6
         Case 1:09-cr-10357-PBS Document 35 Filed 11/05/10 Page 7 of 25



“inarticulate hunches” are not enough. Terry, 392 U.S. at 22.

When making an assessment of whether reasonable suspicion exists,

“the facts [must] be judged against an objective standard,” the

question being whether “the facts available to the officer at the

moment of the search [would] ‘warrant a man of reasonable caution

in the belief’ that the action taken was appropriate[.]” Id. at

21-22.

     Both the initial stop and the officers’ actions after a stop

are subject to Fourth Amendment analysis.          Accordingly, courts

have developed a “two-pronged inquiry,” which asks first “whether

the officer’s action was justified at its inception, and [second]

whether the action taken was reasonably related to the

circumstances which justified the interference in the first

place.” United States v. Am, 564 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir. 2009)

(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).

     At issue in this motion are both the constitutionality of

the initial stop and the constitutionality of the officers’

seizure of the guns and ammunition from the defendant’s backpack.

After considering the evidence presented, the Court concludes

that both withstand constitutional scrutiny.



     A.     Constitutionality of the Stop

     The defendant argues that the initial stop in this case was

unconstitutional because it was based on an unreliable anonymous



                                       7
      Case 1:09-cr-10357-PBS Document 35 Filed 11/05/10 Page 8 of 25



tip that did not refer to any specific illegal activities, and

that the defendant’s flight in response to the officers’ initial

approach with their guns drawn cannot give rise to a reasonable

suspicion of criminal activity.

     1) Anonymity of the Tip:

     In Florida v. J.L., the Supreme Court considered whether an

anonymous tip to police officers that a young black male wearing

a plaid shirt and standing at a bus station had a gun gave rise

to a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity that justified

officers’ temporary detainment of a person fitting this

description. Florida v. J.L., 529 U.S. 269, 269-70 (2000).             The

Court found that the tip lacked even “a moderate indicia of

reliability” and “left the police without means to test the

informant’s knowledge or credibility.” Id. at 271.         Therefore,

without any more information suggesting the possibility of

criminal activity, the police did not have an objectively

reasonable suspicion to justify a Terry stop.

     The tip at issue in this case was anonymous to the extent

that neither the police officers nor the 911 call operator knew

the identity of the caller.     It thus lacked the reliability of a

tip received from someone known to police, but it also contained

certain identifying information not present in J.L., like the

tipster’s location, place of residence, and her relationship to

the subject of the tip.    The question is whether a tip that



                                    8
      Case 1:09-cr-10357-PBS Document 35 Filed 11/05/10 Page 9 of 25



provides this kind of information, but does not provide the

identity of the tipster, can give rise to a reasonable suspicion

justifying a Terry stop.

     The First Circuit has described three different categories

into which a tip may fall. See United States v. Montiero, 447

F.3d 39, 44 (2006).   The first category is illustrated by the

Supreme Court decision in Adams v. Williams, 407 U.S. 143 (1972).

In that case the Court held that a police officer had a

reasonable suspicion of criminal activity based solely on an “in-

person tip from a person ‘known to him.’” Montiero, 447 F.3d at

44 (quoting Adams, 407 U.S. at 144-45).        According to the First

Circuit, a tip in this category, where the tipster is reliable

and known by police, “may in certain circumstances be sufficient

to warrant a Terry stop.” Montiero, 447 F.3d at 44.

     The second category is made up of cases where the police are

not familiar with the tipster but where they do have certain

external indicia of reliability.        This category is illustrated by

the Supreme Court’s decision in Alabama v. White, 496 U.S. 325

(1990).   There the Court held that an anonymous tip that included

certain predictive information about what the subject of the tip

would be doing in the future, like that she “would be leaving

235-C Lynwood Terrace Apartments at a particular time in a brown

Plymouth station wagon with the right taillight lens broken, that

she would be going to Dobey’s motel and that she would be in

possession of about an ounce of cocaine,” justified a Terry stop.

                                    9
      Case 1:09-cr-10357-PBS Document 35 Filed 11/05/10 Page 10 of 25



Montiero, 447 F.3d at 44 (quoting White, 496 U.S. at 327)

(internal quotation marks omitted).       This tip was sufficiently

reliable first because the specific predictive information

reflected the caller’s “special familiarity with” the subject of

the tip and second because this information about future activity

was “significantly corroborated.” Montiero, 447 F.3d at 44

(quoting White, 496 U.S. at 331-32).

     A tip like the one in J.L. falls into the third category.

See Montiero, 447 F.3d at 44.     Unlike tips of the second

category, which are also anonymous, tips in this category are not

corroborated by any other information available to the police.

In J.L. police determined that there was, in fact, a person

matching the description given in the tip standing where the

tipster said he would be standing.      But this alone suggests

merely that the tipster can identify the subject, not that she

has any basis for suspecting criminal activity. See J.L., 529

U.S. at 272.

     This framework gives rise to two questions: first whether

the tip in this case was truly “anonymous,” and second, if it was

anonymous, whether it was corroborated to an extent that it

exhibited “sufficient indicia of reliability to provide

reasonable suspicion to make the investigatory stop.” White, 496

U.S. at 329; see Montiero, 447 F.3d at 45 (presenting the same

two-step analysis).    It is important, however, not to engage in

this inquiry in the abstract.     The question is ultimately whether

                                   10
         Case 1:09-cr-10357-PBS Document 35 Filed 11/05/10 Page 11 of 25



the police had a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was

afoot, and the touchstone of the analysis is whether “in light of

all the circumstances” the “[tip] possessed sufficient indicia of

reliability.” United States v. Ruidiaz, 529 F.3d 25, 31 (1st Cir.

2008).

      In light of all of the circumstances, the tip here was

sufficiently reliable to give rise to a reasonable suspicion.

Even though the caller did not provide her name, she gave enough

identifying information that her tip was not anonymous under the

Montiero framework.       In Ruidiaz the First Circuit held that “not

every report from a nameless source is truly anonymous.” Id. at

30.   In that case the fact that the tipster “confirmed his

telephone number and agreed that the police could call him back”

along with the fact that “the police were well aware of the trace

capabilities of the 911 system, so they knew that a caller could

be tracked down if he provided false information” provided

certain reassurances of reliability. Id.          Here, the caller did

not expressly invite police to return her call, but she did

provide them with her current location on Carney Court and her

place of residence as Revere.        Moreover, the operator had access

to the caller’s phone number, and this information was relayed to

police through the CAD system.         Given current cell phone and

caller ID technology, it is likely, even, that the caller knew

that her number from a cell phone could be traced easily by

police.     This all suggests that she did not intentionally conceal

                                      11
      Case 1:09-cr-10357-PBS Document 35 Filed 11/05/10 Page 12 of 25



her identity from police in order to prevent them from “h[olding]

her responsible if her allegations turn[ed] out to be false.”

J.L., 529 U.S. at 270.

     Officers’ access to information about how the tipster knew

the defendant also mitigated her anonymity and provided police

with a means of evaluating her reliability.        In J.L., the Court

noted that the tipster had not “supplied any basis for believing

he had inside information about J.L.” Id. at 271.         Without

information about how a tipster knows the subject of his tip,

police have nothing to go on but the “bare report[s] of unknown,

unaccountable informant[s].” Id.        Here, on the other hand, police

officers knew that the tipster’s niece was the defendant’s

girlfriend.   They also knew that the tipster was on the street

watching the defendant and reporting his movements in real time.

Even though the tipster was unknown, this information provided

officers with the basis for the tipster’s knowledge and a means

of evaluating her credibility.      This is a far cry from the

typical anonymous tip situation involving an unknown tipster

providing unsubstantiated information completely out of context.

     The defendant argues that the tip at issue in this case is

particularly unreliable because the tipster did not have actual

knowledge of criminal activity but relied on another source,

seemingly her mother.    Indeed, the First Circuit has noted that

tips relying on hearsay statements are inherently unreliable:

“While the police or a 911 operator often can make some rough

                                   12
      Case 1:09-cr-10357-PBS Document 35 Filed 11/05/10 Page 13 of 25



judgments about the age, cognitive ability, and motivations of an

anonymous informant based on her tone of voice. . . or appearance

and demeanor. . ., the police [in hearsay tip situations] have no

way of knowing the state of mind of the informant when she gave

her information, or whether she was a person who could be relied

on to relate events accurately.” Montiero, 447 F.3d at 46.              The

tip at issue here, however, is not the typical hearsay tip.             In

Montiero, the tipster reported that a relative of his had

witnessed criminal activity involving the defendant. Id. at 41.

Not only did the tipster refuse to give any information about his

relative, but the police were aware that the tipster had a reason

to fabricate allegations against the defendant. Id. at 46.              In

this case, the police knew that the person with actual knowledge

of the defendant’s possession of a firearm was the tipster’s

mother; they also had reason to believe that the mother was

present with the tipster while she was on the phone with police;

and a recording of the call reveals that the mother’s voice is

actually audible.

     Finally, the circumstances of the call must be taken into

account.   The First Circuit has noted that courts should give

“special weight” to anonymous tips where public safety may be at

risk, including tips involving emergency 911 phone calls. See

Ruidaz, 529 F.3d at 31 n.2; Montiero, 447 F.3d at 49.          Where

there is no time to investigate a tip before making a stop,

police must be able to rely on anonymous tips alone as long as

                                   13
         Case 1:09-cr-10357-PBS Document 35 Filed 11/05/10 Page 14 of 25



those tips reflect certain minimal indicia of reliability, as is

the case here.

     2) Content of the Tip:

     In order to make a Terry stop the police must have

reasonable suspicion that “criminal activity is afoot.”             Here the

tip may have given police reasonable suspicion that the defendant

had a gun, but on its own it did not support an allegation of

criminal activity.       In Massachusetts, mere possession of a

firearm is not a crime. See United States v. Collins, No. C.R.A.

02-10152-RWZ, 2003 WL 21212743 at *2 (D. Mass. May 23, 2003)

(citing Commonwealth v. Alvarado, 667 N.E.2d 856, 858 (Mass.

1996)).     In this sense, the tipster’s allegations alone here are

“no different than if [she] had told the 911 operator that [the

defendant] possessed a wallet. . . .          Though a search of that

wallet may have revealed counterfeit bills. . ., the officers had

no reason to stop [the defendant] based merely on information

that he possessed a wallet, and the seized bills would have to be

suppressed.” United States v. Ubiles, 224 F.3d 213, 218 (3rd Cir.

2000).

     On the other hand, reasonable suspicion is not probable

cause, and it does not require police to eliminate all innocent

explanations for a person’s conduct before stopping him. See

United States v. Gould, 364 F.3d 578, 593 n.17 (5th Cir. 2004).

Though the police may not have had justification to stop the



                                      14
      Case 1:09-cr-10357-PBS Document 35 Filed 11/05/10 Page 15 of 25



defendant on the tip alone, other circumstances may have given

them the requisite suspicion.     In cases involving tips asserting

that someone had a gun when mere possession was not a crime,

courts have held that other circumstances along with the

possibility of a firearm can give rise to reasonable suspicion.

See, e.g., United States v. Velentine, 232 F.3d 350, 356 (3rd

Cir. 2000)(finding that the defendant’s presence in a high-crime

area at a 1:00 am, along with officers’ suspicion that he had a

weapon was sufficient to give rise to a reasonable suspicion);

Commonwealth v. Depeiza, 449 Mass. 367, 370 (2007)(citing a

number of additional factors including the defendant’s location,

the time, and his gait).

     There is no indication that any of these circumstances were

present when officers first approached the defendant with their

guns drawn, but that initial interaction did not constitute a

stop subject to constitutional scrutiny.       The police were acting

within their authority when they approached the defendant even if

they did not initially have a reasonable suspicion of criminal

activity. See Florida v. Bostick, 501 U.S. 429, 434 (1991).             Of

course the police in this case did more than approach the

defendant to ask questions; they walked toward him with guns

drawn and ordered him to the ground.       As the defendant

acknowledges in his brief, however, even these actions do not yet

constitute a stop because the defendant did not actually submit

to police authority. (Def. Brief at 6.)       In California v. Hodari

                                   15
      Case 1:09-cr-10357-PBS Document 35 Filed 11/05/10 Page 16 of 25



D., 499 U.S. 621 (1991), the Supreme Court held that a seizure

under the Fourth Amendment has not occurred until the police

“either [apply] physical force. . .or, where that is absent, [the

suspect] subm[its] to the assertion of authority.” Id. at 626.

Here the defendant was not seized until he submitted to police

authority on Concord Street after attempting to flee from his

original interaction with the police.       The fact that the police

initially approached the defendant with their guns drawn may be a

show of force that has some bearing on the constitutional issue

here, but it did not constitute the “laying on of hands or

application of physical force” required in Hodari D.. Id. at 625;

see also United States v. Waterman, 569 F.3d 144, 146 (3rd Cir.

2009)(“While [police officers drawing their guns] definitely

constituted a display of force, we conclude that it fell short of

the physical force required under Hodari D..”); United States v.

Johnson, 212 F.3d 1313, 1314 (D.C. Cir. 2000)(finding that a stop

had not occurred when police officers approached a suspect with

their guns drawn and ordered him to raise his hands).          Attempted

seizures of a person are generally beyond the scope of the Fourth

Amendment.   Thus, this initial interaction does not have any

constitutional significance on its own. See Hodari D., 499 U.S.

at 626 n.2; Cnty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. at 844-45

(1998).   And the question is whether subsequent events, namely

the defendant’s flight, provided police with a reasonable



                                   16
      Case 1:09-cr-10357-PBS Document 35 Filed 11/05/10 Page 17 of 25



suspicion of criminal activity that was not supported by the tip

alone. See United States v. Simmons, 560 F.3d 98, 106-107 (2nd

Cir. 2009)(collecting cases where grounds for a stop may be based

on events that occur after the order to stop is given).

     3) The Defendant’s Flight

     The Supreme Court has held that flight from police may give

rise to a reasonable suspicion even if officers would not have

otherwise had justification for making a stop. See Illinois v.

Wardlaw, 528 U.S. 119, 124-25 (2000).       This rule is derived from

the general principle that “the determination of reasonable

suspicion must be based on commonsense judgments and inferences

about human behavior.” Id. at 125.      There is no obligation to

cooperate with police, but “unprovoked flight is simply not a

mere refusal to cooperate.”     Id. “It is not necessarily

indicative of wrongdoing, but it is certainly suggestive of

such.” Id. at 124.

     Even if the tip that the defendant had a firearm, which is

not in itself a crime, would not give rise to reasonable

suspicion that criminal activity was afoot, the defendant’s

flight in addition to this information justified the stop.              In

United States v. Muhammad, 463 F.3d 115 (2nd Cir. 2006), the

Second Circuit found that a truly anonymous tip under J.L. could

be corroborated by “evasive conduct,” in that case, a defendant’s

efforts to speed past a police cruiser attempting to stop him on


                                   17
      Case 1:09-cr-10357-PBS Document 35 Filed 11/05/10 Page 18 of 25



his bicycle. Id. at 123.     The court recognized that “reasonable

suspicion” is derived from the “totality of the circumstances.”

Id. at 125.   It may have been that the anonymous tip did not

provide enough information to justify a stop, but once the

defendant evaded police, the likelihood that he was engaged in

criminal activity increased.

     Similarly, in this case, when they approached the defendant,

police only had information that he had a firearm and a possible

outstanding warrant.    However, once they ordered the Defendant to

surrender and lie on the ground, and he responded by fleeing from

three officers following on foot and one in a police cruiser,

police had a sufficient basis for believing that criminal

activity was afoot. See Depiza, 868 N.E.2d at 97 (2007).

     The Defendant points out that his original interaction with

the police was much more intimidating than the average police

inquiry, and argues that these circumstances complicate the

assumption that his flight was indicative of criminal activity,

as opposed to, say, fear.     It is certainly true that there is no

bright line rule providing that flight alone is always sufficient

for reasonable suspicion.     After all, the Supreme Court has

instructed that assumptions about the import of a suspect’s

flight are grounded in “commonsense judgments and inferences

about human behavior.” Wardlaw, 528 U.S. at 125.         If the only

basis for the stop had been the fact that the defendant fled from

the police when they approached with their guns drawn, the stop

                                   18
      Case 1:09-cr-10357-PBS Document 35 Filed 11/05/10 Page 19 of 25



may have been unconstitutional.      But given all of the information

available to police by the time they stopped the Defendant on

Concord Street, officers had a reasonable suspicion that the

defendant was engaged in criminal activity.        They had received

information they believed to be reliable that the defendant had a

weapon, and they also observed the defendant flee in response to

their approach.   Moreover, the Defendant engaged in prolonged

headlong flight over the course of a few blocks, behavior at

least suggestive of criminal activity. See United States v.

Franklin, 323 F.3d 1298, 1302 (11th Cir. 2003)(taking into

account the “nature and duration” of a suspect’s flight in

determining that it justified a Terry stop).        Any single piece of

information available to police may have been insufficient to

justify the stop, but “the totality of the circumstances” gave

rise to a reasonable suspicion.

     B.   Constitutionality of the Recovery of the Weapon

     The Defendant argues that even if the seizure was

constitutional at its inception, officers unlawfully searched his

backpack to recover the gun.

     There is no question that the officers were justified in

frisking the defendant.    “[I]n determining whether a pat-down

search is an appropriate step following a valid Terry stop, the

key is whether, under the circumstances, ‘the officer is

justified in believing that the person is armed and dangerous to



                                   19
      Case 1:09-cr-10357-PBS Document 35 Filed 11/05/10 Page 20 of 25



the officer or others.’” United States v. Romain, 393 F.3d 63, 71

(1st Cir. 2004)(quoting United States v. Schiavo, 29 F.3d 6, 8

(1st Cir. 1994)); see also United States v. Soares, 521 F.3d 117,

120 (1st Cir. 2008).    In this case officers had reason to suspect

that the defendant was carrying a weapon, and they patted him

down to ensure their own safety.

     The Defendant argues, however, that the frisk of the

backpack was only legal up until the point when it was removed

from his body.   In United States v. Pardue, 385 F.3d 101 (1st

Cir. 2004), the First Circuit agreed with the district court’s

finding that where there was no “particularized safety concern,”

and an officer could not perform a warrantless search on a

suspect’s backpack after that backpack had been removed from the

suspect and placed on the trunk of the police cruiser while the

suspect was sitting in the rear of the cruiser. Id. at 105.

     It is true that after a threat to officer safety is removed,

officers no longer have the authority to frisk a suspect for

weapons. See Terry, 392 U.S. at 26 (Officers’ protective search

must be “limited to that which is necessary for the discovery of

weapons which might be used to harm the officer or others

nearby.”).   But this rule cannot be applied rigidly, particularly

in situations where a stop and frisk must happen quickly.          The

officers here, could not have patted down the defendants’

backpack for the first time after it had been removed from his

body and was sitting at some distance away from him.          But there

                                   20
      Case 1:09-cr-10357-PBS Document 35 Filed 11/05/10 Page 21 of 25



is no requirement that the officers carefully remove the backpack

without feeling its contents.     Here officers first felt the

firearm through the outside of the backpack when they were

removing it from the defendant or immediately afterwards.          At

that point they had not yet completely removed the threat to

officer safety.

     The resulting question is whether the officers were

justified in retrieving the firearm from the backpack after the

threat to officer safety had been removed.        Under the plain-feel

doctrine, “[i]f a police officer lawfully pats down a suspect's

outer clothing and feels an object whose contour or mass makes

its identity [as contraband] immediately apparent,” the officer

can seize the object without a warrant. Minnesota v. Dickerson,

508 U.S. 366, 375 (1993); see also United States v. Proctor, 148

F.3d 39, 43 (1st Cir. 1998).     In order to legally seize an object

plainly felt during a valid search, however, officers must have

“probable cause to believe that the item is contraband.”

Dickerson, 508 U.S. at 376.     Here, whether or not the firearm was

positioned with its barrel up (as the police officers testified)

or its barrel down (as the defendant testified), the police

officers would have been able to clearly identify it as a firearm

by feeling the outside of the backpack.       But, as discussed above,

not every concealed firearm is illegal contraband, and although

the police officers may have had a reasonable suspicion that the



                                   21
      Case 1:09-cr-10357-PBS Document 35 Filed 11/05/10 Page 22 of 25



defendant had a committed crime, it is more difficult to say that

they had probable cause to believe that the gun they felt in the

backpack was illegal.    There is no evidence that at the time of

the stop police knew of any of the circumstances, like the

defendant’s prior conviction and prison sentence, that made his

possession of a gun illegal, but police did have access to

information that would have at least suggested the gun’s illicit

status.   After all, although it is possible that the defendant

fled from police because of his outstanding warrant, there is no

evidence that he even knew about the warrant, and it seems more

likely that he ran from them because of the firearm in his

backpack.   Although it is a much closer call, the Court finds

that the circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that

criminal activity was afoot, plus the fact that, upon feeling the

backpack, the officers knew the defendant indeed had a weapon,

gave rise to at least a “probability or substantial chance” that

the firearm in the backpack was illegal. Illinois v. Gates, 462

U.S. 213, 245 n.13 (1983)(defining “probable cause” for

determining whether a warrant can be issued).

     The fact that this belief was grounded in circumstances

unrelated to the actual tactile sensation of the gun is

irrelevant.   The plain-feel doctrine does not justify the seizure

of objects only determined to be contraband after searches that

exceed the legal bounds of a Terry stop. See Dickerson,508 U.S.

at 378 (“[T]he officer’s continued exploration of respondent’s

                                   22
      Case 1:09-cr-10357-PBS Document 35 Filed 11/05/10 Page 23 of 25



pocket after having concluded that it contained no weapon was

unrelated [to the justification for the search].”). But all

legally obtained information can form the basis for a

determination that an object is contraband.        Here the officers

legally acquired information suggesting the defendant had an

illegal firearm, and legally felt the backpack as they were

removing it from the defendant.      They were, thus, justified in

seizing the firearm even after removing the backpack from the

defendant’s body.

     Even if the officers were not justified in seizing the

firearm under the “plain-feel” doctrine, it should not be

suppressed because the police would have inevitably discovered it

when they arrested the defendant on his default warrant.          Under

the inevitable discovery rule, evidence discovered through

unconstitutional means is still admissible if the prosecution can

show that police would ultimately have discovered it

notwithstanding the constitutional violation. See Nix v.

Williams, 467 U.S. 431, 447-48 (1984); United States v. Zapata,

18 F.3d 971, 978-79 (1st Cir. 1994).       The First Circuit has

developed a three-part test for determining whether evidence

falls within the inevitable discovery exception:

     first whether the legal means [are] truly independent;

     second, whether both the use of the legal means and the
     discovery by that means are truly inevitable; and,

     third, whether the application of the inevitable discovery
exception either provides an incentive for police misconduct or

                                   23
      Case 1:09-cr-10357-PBS Document 35 Filed 11/05/10 Page 24 of 25



significantly weakens fourth amendment protection.

Pardue, 385 F.3d at 106 (citing cases)(internal quotation marks

omitted).

     Testimony in the suppression hearing revealed that the

discovery of the weapon would have been truly inevitable.          As

Officer Stancato testified, even if they had not discovered the

weapon on the scene, police would have discovered the Defendant’s

warrant after they ran the defendant’s name through their warrant

check system available in the police cruiser.        They then would

have arrested the defendant on the warrant and would have

discovered the firearm when booking him on that arrest. See

Pardue, 385 F.3d at 107 (“[T]he ammunition would have been

discovered in the backpack [upon arrest] by way of a routine

search of personal belongings.”).

     The arrest and discovery would also have occurred entirely

independent from the discovery of the weapon upon feeling the

defendant’s backpack. From the 911 call the police had

information about both the defendant’s identity – which would

have enabled them to run a warrant check – and the fact that he

had a warrant – which would have justified running a warrant

check as part of the investigatory stop.       But even if the police

did not know the Defendant’s identity and had no idea that he had

a warrant, they would have been justified in investigating these

issues as part of the stop.     Police performing Terry stops are

clearly justified in inquiring into a suspect’s identity. See

Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Court, 542 U.S. 177, 186 (2004)

(“Our decisions make clear that questions concerning a suspect's

                                   24
         Case 1:09-cr-10357-PBS Document 35 Filed 11/05/10 Page 25 of 25



identity are a routine and accepted part of many Terry stops.”).

And although this Circuit has not explicitly found that warrant

checks are necessarily within the scope of all investigatory

stops, it has acknowledged that “most circuits have held that an

officer does not impermissibly expand the scope of a Terry stop

by performing a background and warrant check, even where that

search is unrelated to the circumstances that initially drew the

officer's attention.” Klaucke v. Daly, 595 F.3d 20, 26 (1st Cir.

2010).    Therefore, even if they had not discovered the firearm

after opening the defendant’s backpack, police would have been

justified in running a warrant check on the defendant upon

stopping him on Concord Street and would have then arrested him

and discovered the weapon through independent and lawful means.

     Finally, there is no danger that allowing the evidence in

through the inevitable discovery exception would “provide[] an

incentive for police misconduct or significantly weaken[] fourth

amendment protection.”       Even if the police did invade the

defendant’s Fourth Amendment rights, which this Court does not

believe, they did not do so intentionally, and this prong of the

exception must be applied with appropriate weight given to the

severity of the exclusionary rule. See Pardue, 385 F.3d at 107.

                                  Conclusion

     Defendant’s motion to suppress is denied.
