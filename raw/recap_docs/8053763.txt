         (I) the date on which the judgment of conviction became final;
         (2) the date on which the impediment to making a motion created by governmental action in violation of the
         Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the movant was prevented from making such a
         motion by such governmental action;
         (3) the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been
         newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or
         (4) the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through
         the exercise of due diligence.
