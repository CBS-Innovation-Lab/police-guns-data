                   GOVERNMENT’S SENTENCING MEMORANDUM

       The United States of America, by its attorneys, Michael J. Sullivan, United States

Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, and William F. Bloomer, Assistant U.S. Attorney,

submits its Sentencing Memorandum with respect to Edwin Torrez ("Torrez").

                                       INTRODUCTION

       Defendant Torrez was a midlevel dealer in a massive heroin distribution organization.
       He obtained a total of 76 grams of heroin from Julio Santiago in approximate 20-gram
       increments on four occasions from June to September of 2004. At the conclusion of the
       investigation on October 15, 2004, agents searched a storage facility belonging to Torres
       and found a digital scale, a diluent ("cut"), numerous plastic baggies bearing an "It's
       Hot" imprint that identified his specific street brand of heroin, spoons, and plastic bags
       bearing an apple logo -- the same type of bags found in the possession of two other mid-
       level heroin distributors within the organization. For the reasons provided below, the
       government recommends a sentence of incarceration at the low-end of the advisory
       guideline range of 30 months. Such a recommendation is entirely reasonable in the
       circumstances of this case, United States v. Jiminenez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 518 (1st Cir.
       2006)(en banc), if not downright gracious.

       To determine a defendant’s final sentence, this Court must follow the three-step

sentencing approach espoused by the First Circuit. United States v. Dixon, 449 F.3d 194, 204

(1st Cir. 2006); United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 518 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc);

United States v. Robinson, 433 F.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir. 2005). First, this Court must calculate the

advisory guideline range. E.g., United States v. Pho, 433 F.3d 53, 61 (1st Cir. 2006). Second,

the Court must determine whether any traditional departures apply to the case at hand. E.g.,
     Case 1:04-cr-10336-NMG           Document 344         Filed 01/10/2007      Page 2 of 9



United States v. Saez, 444 F.3d 15, 17 (1st Cir. 2006). Finally, the Court needs to determine

whether any factors put forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) offer a persuasive reason to impose a

sentence outside of the proposed guideline range. E.g., Robinson, 433 F.3d at 35. While all §

3353(a) factors must be considered by this Court, “it is not required to address those factors, one

by one, in some sort of rote incantation when explicating its sentencing decision.” Dixon, 449

F.3d at 205; see also United States v. Navedo-Concepcion, 450 F.3d 54, 57-58 (1st Cir. 2006)

(reasoning that in every decision the main factors contributing to the sentence must be identified

by the sentencing court, but there is no “requirement for a lengthy or detailed recitation or one

addressing every claim and counter-argument; rather, the reviewing court needs, and both parties

deserve, a specific explanation and not just a reference to the evidence.”).1

       The government explains below its view of the proper consideration in this case of the

guideline application and Section 3553(a) factors.




       1
         As this Court is aware, following a ten-day trial, a jury returned guilty verdicts against
five of the eleven codefendants in this case -- Julio SANTIAGO, Juan NUNEZ, Carlos COLON,
Jose RODRIGUEZ, and Carlos SANCHEZ -- with respect to Count One of the Superseding
Indictment. The jury also found Julio SANTIAGO guilty of the firearms offenses set forth in
Count Seven, namely, possession of firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, and
possession of unregistered firearms, to wit: silencers, (Count Eight). The jury further found that
the conspiracy as a whole was responsible for more than 1,000 grams of heroin. With the
exception of Enrique AGOSTO, the remaining defendants -- Reynaldo RIVERA, Zuleima
REYES, Santiago ARROYO, Jose TORRADO, and Luis SANCHEZ -- have all pleaded guilty
before the Honorable Nathaniel M. Gorton to Counts One of the Superseding Indictment.
AGOSTO was severed from his co-defendants for purposes of trial and the charges against him
remain outstanding. Jose TORRADO is the only defendant to have been sentenced in this case.
On June 2, 2006, TORRADO pleaded guilty before the Honorable Nathaniel M. Gorton to Count
One of the Superseding Indictment. He was sentenced that same date to a minimum mandatory
60 months imprisonment and 4 years' supervised release.

                                            ANALYSIS

       Although there is no written plea agreement, the government and TORREZ agree that

TORREZ is responsible for between 60 and 80 grams of heroin, and that his Base Level Offense

is 22. The parties arrive at that calculation by attributing the following amounts to TORREZ:

06/07/04       16 grams (coded as "$16.00 for the registry")
06/30/04       20 grams (coded as "two good pesos for Taylor")
08/20/04       20 grams (meet at Foundry Street)
09/02/04       20 grams (meet at TAVO's)

TOTAL          76 grams

       According to the PSR, TORREZ is a Criminal History Category I and is therefore safety-

valve eligible under §§ 5C1.2 and 2D1.1(b)(7), provided that he satisfies criterion 5.2 (PSR ¶¶

183-184). With a three-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, TORREZ's Total

Offense Level is 19 and his GSR is 30 to 37 months. (PSR ¶¶ 184).

       A       Importance of the Guideline Range.

       Even though the guidelines are advisory, the First Circuit has ruled that the guidelines

remain a central component of any sentencing post-Booker. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 518;

see also United States v. Kandirakis, No. 04-10372-WGY, 2006 WL 2147610, at *10 (1st Cir.

August 1, 2006) (stating “the Guidelines - and their judge-made factual findings - are still the

driving force behind federal sentencing”). The First Circuit explained that the “guidelines

remained ‘an important consideration’ because they represented the only ‘integration of the

multiple factors’ identified in the statute, often reflected past practice, and bore the imprimatur of



       2
         As of the date of this memorandum, TORREZ has not met this requirement of safety-
valve eligibility and it is not anticipated that he will do so.

                                                  3

the [Sentencing Commission] expert agency charged with developing them.” United States v.

Smith, 445 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2006), quoting Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 518. The continuing

importance of the guidelines is such that the more the judge’s sentence differs from the advisory

guideline range - either higher or lower - the more compelling the judge’s justification must be

for the atypical sentence. See Kandirakis, 2006 WL 2147610, at *11; United States v. Thurston,

No. 05-2271, 2006 WL 2065404, at *4 (1st Cir. July 26, 2006); Smith, 445 F.3d at 4.

        The importance of the final guideline range has nothing to do with the guidelines’ former

mandatory status, which was eliminated in Booker. Instead, reasonableness is judged in relation

to the guidelines for three reasons adopted by the First Circuit in United States v. Jiménez-

Beltre: (1) only the guidelines comprehensively examine the full panoply of sentencing

considerations; (2) the guidelines represent decades of nationwide experience and study; and

(3) they are the only measure for avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities. See 440 F.3d at

518. Congress explicitly created the Sentencing Commission and guidelines to achieve these

ends. Id.

        The continued adherence to the now advisory guidelines remains evident in appellate

courts across the country. While courts have repeatedly reversed as unreasonable sentences

outside the applicable guideline ranges,3 reversals of sentences imposed within the guideline

range have been extraordinarily rare. Kandirakis, 2006 WL 2147610, at *43 n.36; see also

  See, e.g, Zapete-Garcia, 447 F.3d at 60 (holding that defendant’s forty-eight month sentence – eight
times the maximum of the advisory sentencing guideline range – was unreasonable as the district court
failed to provide a reason for such a mammoth variance and neither defendant’s prior deportations or
arrest justified the increase); Smith, 445 F.3d at 5-6 (finding that defendant’s forty-six month sentence –
less than half the minimum advisory guideline range – for six counts of crack distribution and one count
conspiring to sell narcotics was unreasonable as the defendant’s minor role was taken into account in the
guideline calculation and the defendant had previously sold narcotics near schools, violated post-arrest
release terms, and had no better than usual rehabilitation prospects).

United States v. Cooper, 437 F.3d 324, 331 (3d Cir. 2006) (“[I]t is less likely that a within-

guidelines sentence, as opposed to an outside-guidelines sentence, will be unreasonable”);

United States v. Mares, 402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir. 2005) (“[I]t will be rare for a reviewing court

to say [a within-Guidelines sentence] is ‘unreasonable.’”). In the post-Booker era, only one

within-guidelines sentence has been found blatantly unreasonable. United States v. Lazenby,

439 F.3d 928, 933 (8th Cir. 2006) (sentence based on comparison to co-defendant’s sentence

found unreasonable). Furthermore, just two additional sentences have been reversed where the

appellate court determined that the district court judge failed to provide an adequate explanation

of the within-guidelines sentence. United States v. Carty, 453 F.3d 1214 (9th Cir. 2006); United

States v. Vonner, 452 F.3d 560 (6th Cir. 2006). Moreover, the First Circuit and its sister circuits

have emphasized that the further outside the range, either above or below, a sentence falls, the

stronger must be the justification for such disparate sentencing.

       Against this backdrop, the government turns to the defendant's first argument -- which is

actually a convolution of the consideration set forth in §3553(a)(1), (addressing the nature and

circumstances of the offense), and a request for a departure based upon a minor or minimal role

adjustment under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2.


       Despite defendant's claim to the contrary, Torrez was a significant participant in the

conspiracy for which he is being held accountable and he should not receive either a minimal or

minor role reduction under U.S.S.G. §3B1.2. Role adjustments are “heavily dependent upon the

facts of the particular case.” U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2, n.3(C). To receive any reduction, Torrez must show

that he is "substantially less culpable than the average participant." U.S.S.G. §3B1.2, Application

Note 3(A); see United States v. Lopez-Gil, 965 F.2d 1124, 1131 (1st Cir. 1992)("defendant has

burden of proving entitlement to such a downward adjustment") citing United States v. Ocasio, 914

F.2d 330, 332 (1st Cir. 1990). Moreover, the Guidelines caution that the minimal participant

adjustment is to be used "infrequently."

       Here, Torrez obtained multiple amounts of heroin for redistribution from Santiago on at least

four occasions from June 2004 through September 2004. He was not, as the defense suggests, "a

limited courier of information and contraband" or a "runner" who simply obeyed orders. (D.Br. 2).

His storage facility held accouterments associated with a fairly significant heroin distribution point

-- a digital scale; drug packaging materials associated with street-level distribution, including “It’s

Hot” and Apple baggies; a diluent used to increase the amount of heroin available for sale and

thereby maximize profits; spoons and sandwich baggies. In June 2004, he was intercepted ordering

"two of the good ones for Taylor" from Santiago (the parties agree that this coded conversation

refers to two "fingers" or 20 grams of heroin). Agents then observed Torrez meeting with Santiago

at his storage facility. This evidence directly undermines the theory that he was simply a mule or

transporter of narcotics who had no input into the quantities of heroin sold, customers, or price.

       Moreover, the trial testimony of expert witness Jamie Cepero and Task Force Agent Marcos

Chavez established that one gram of heroin could be "cut" or diluted to 100 "hits" of heroin on the

street (making the 76 grams of heroin equivalent to 7,600 "hits" of heroin once it is sold to the

consumer in baggies like the "It's Hot" baggies found in Torrez's storage facility). He cannot, and

should not, be deemed a "minor" or "minimal" participant under U.S.S.G. §3B1.2.

       Even assuming that defendant is less culpable than Santiago or Juan Nunez, the leaders in

this conspiracy scheme, Torrez simply cannot establish that he is less culpable than most others

involved in this particular offense. Based upon the extensive evidence set forth in the Offense


                                                  6
      Case 1:04-cr-10336-NMG           Document 344         Filed 01/10/2007        Page 7 of 9



Conduct of the PSR, Torrez clearly was at the same level in the distribution chain as Luis Sanchez,

Enrique Agosto, Jose Rodriguez, Jose Torrado, and Carlos Colon (a/k/a Pedro Miranda). Arguably,

he was situated above the likes of Santiago Arroyo and Zuleima Reyes, who, it could be argued,

acted as runners for Reynaldo Rivera.

       Moreover, it cannot be said that Torrez is "less culpable than the average participant" in a

similar conspiracy. Torrez must not only show that he is less culpable than most others involved

in this particular offense, but that he is less culpable than defendants charged in similar cases. See

United States v. Ortiz-Santiago, 211 F.3d 146, 149 (1st Cir. 2000)("defendant has the burden of

proving that he is both less culpable than most others involved in the offense of conviction and less

culpable than most other miscreants convicted of comparable crimes."). This he cannot do

        Recently, in United States v. Cao, No. 06-1224 (C.A. 1 (Me) December 15, 2006), the First

Circuit affirmed the district court's decision at sentencing not to give the defendant a role reduction

as a minor or minimal participant. Even though the defendant was less culpable than the leaders of

the conspiracy, "that is not enough: he was required to show that he was less culpable than the

average participant, a judgment normally made not with statistics but by practical indicia like role,

frequency, and duration." Id. at 4. The Court in Cao observed that the district court's decision was

supported by the fact that the defendant made multiple trips over time between Massachusetts and

Maine, bringing drugs to Maine and money to Massachusetts, and supplying multiple customers.

Id.

       If anything, Torrez was more culpable than the average participant in a similar conspiracy

because he substantially participated in the charged criminal conduct by accepting large amounts

of heroin and processing it for redistribution with the implements found in his storage locker.


                                                  7

Consequently, he was not a "minor" or "minimal" participant in the conduct for which he is being

held accountable. Probation concurs in this judgment. See PSR ¶ 135.

B.     Application of the § 3553(a) Factors.

       In this case, no unusual circumstances exist which warrant an exception to the preference

for guideline sentencing. Section 3553(a)(4) and (5) specifically direct the Court to consider the

applicable guidelines, and Section 3553(a)(6) commands that the Court strive to avoid disparity in

sentencing, which, as explained above, is best accomplished through faithful application of the

guidelines. The other 3553(a) factors also point to this conclusion.

       Torrez reports no significant physical impairments aside from high blood pressure, for

which he is receiving medication(PSR ¶164). He reports good mental and emotional health and

does not feel the need for psychological assistance (PSR ¶165). Torrez reports no history of

substance abuse or alcoholism (PSR ¶¶ 167-168). Although he has limited education,(PSR

¶169), he has at times maintained steady employment(PSR ¶¶ 173-174).

       In short, the PSR reflects nothing unusual or extraordinary in Torrez's background to

justify taking him outside of the heartland of cases already addressed by the Sentencing

Guidelines absent a motion by the government. C.f., Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, 116

S.Ct. 2035, 2047 (1996) (“[b]efore a departure is permitted, certain aspects of the case must be

found unusual enough for it to fall outside the heartland of cases in the Guideline”). His receipt

of multiple deliveries of high-grade heroin demonstrate that this was no "aberration," as the

defense suggests, and the government for its part is none too convinced that the defendant "will

never come before any court again." (D.Br. 3).

       Torrez chose to inject poison into the Greater Lowell community simply as a means to

make money. To reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law and

provide just punishment, to afford adequate deterrence and to protect the public, nothing should

steer him outside the federal sentencing guideline range. See United States v. Thurston, No. 05-

2271 (1st Cir. July 26, 2006) (discussing Congressional goal of promoting national uniformity in

sentencing).
