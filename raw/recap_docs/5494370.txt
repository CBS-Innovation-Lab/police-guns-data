          SENTENCING MEMORANDUM OF DEFENDANT PURSUANT
      TO F.R.Cr.P. RULE 32(a)(C) and 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)


     It has been uniform and constant in the federal judicial
     tradition for the sentencing judge to consider every
     convicted person as an individual and every case as a
     unique study in the human failings that sometimes
     mitigate, sometimes magnify, the crime and the punishment
     to ensue.
     United States v. Koon, 518 U.S. 81, 113 (1996)



     This memorandum is being submitted to assist this

Honorable Court in its determination of the most appropriate

sentence for Mr. Torres by addressing each of the available

sentencing options under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a),

inclusive of any consideration of the        United States Sentencing

Guidelines.

     The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit

in United States v. Jimenez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 518 (1st Cir.

2006) reiterated the importance of the imposition of a

discretionary “reasonable sentence” (...“guidelines are still

generalizations that can point to outcomes that may appear

unreasonable to sentencing judges in particular cases” ...).

As set forth below the guidelines calculations in this


                                   1
     Case 1:04-cr-10336-NMG   Document 340   Filed 01/06/2007   Page 2 of 6


particular case do not provide an appropriate measure for

sentencing Mr. Torres as an individual, or exact a sentence

that is “sufficient, but not greater than necessary” to carry

out the purposes of sentencing outlined in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).

        This Honorable Court is free to look at all the factors of

18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) in imposing a “reasonable sentence.”               While

§ 3553(a)(4) requires the Court to consider the Guideline

ranges, “it permits the court to tailor the sentence in light

of other statutory concerns as well, see § 3553(a).” Booker,

Breyer, J. 125 S.Ct. at 757.

        This sentencing approach is consistent with the view that

was expressed by Justice Kennedy in his 2003 speech to the

American Bar Association when he openly commented on the unfair

severity of federal sentences: “Our resources are misspent, our

punishments too severe, our sentences too long....In the

federal system the sentencing guidelines are responsible in

part for the increase in prison terms....The Federal Sentencing

Guidelines should be revised downward...(emphasis added.)”



18 U.S.C. § 3553 SENTENCING FACTORS

1.     The nature and circumstances of the offense, 18 U.S.C. §

3553(a)(1).      In the case at bar, Mr. Torres’s participation was

minimal.     According to the wiretap and physical evidence he was

a limited a courier of information and contraband.              As a

“runner” for another he obeyed the orders given to him by those

who were the suppliers. He would do as he as told. He also

allowed his baseball club facility to be used for the storage

of drug paraphernalia. See: PSR ¶ 45.          Mr. Torres had no

                                      2
  Case 1:04-cr-10336-NMG   Document 340   Filed 01/06/2007     Page 3 of 6


decision making authority as to the quantities, the customer

nor the price. Under the sentencing guidelines he should be

considered a “minor participant.       U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2; see United

States v. Santos, 357 F.3d 136, 142 (1st Cir. 2004).



1B.   The history and characteristics of the defendant .

      Before the Court is a 41 year old man with no prior

criminal history.    The instant offense is an aberration in an

otherwise law-abiding and hardworking life. Mr. Torres,

however, is illiterate and unskilled. At best he has a fourth

grade education and as such is easily influenced by others.

Mr. Torres is in need of education and training.             See PSR ¶s

169-174.

(2)(A) (B) (C).       The need for the sentence “to reflect the

seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law and

to provide just punishment for the offense; to afford adequate

deterrence to criminal conduct; to protect the public from

further crimes of the defendant.



      Mr. Torres   stands convicted of a serious felony drug

conviction.   As such he will forever be barred from a number of

federal benefits.    Any sentence imposed will be a significant

punishment for a man who has never previously spent a day in

jail. The instant offense and its consequences are themselves

an unforgiving education.     There is little question that Mr.

Torres will never come before any court again.

2 (D) “to provide the defendant with needed educational or

vocational training, medical care, or other correctional

treatment in the most effective manner.”

    It is clear that Mr. Torres is also in need of further

training and/or education.     As set forth above Mr. Torres has

only fourth grade education and no significant skills.


(4). The applicable category of offense under the Advisory

Guidelines.

       Mr. Torres respectfully submits that any consideration of

the Sentencing Guidelines should take into account the

following advisory guideline provisions:



Base Offense Level, U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1( c)(9)                                 22

Minor Role in the Offense      U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2                             -2

Acceptance of Responsibility U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1                               -3

Total Offense Level                                                         17

Criminal History I

Applicable Guideline Range                (Level 17) 24-30 months



(6).    The need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities

with similar records who have been found guilty of similar

conduct.

       This is Mr. Torres’s first criminal offense.          At a minimum

he will be placed on 3 years of supervised release following

any period of imprisonment.     Given that he is a first time

offender, with minimal involvement when compared with not only

his co-defendant’s but also similar people who have been

convicted of similar offenses, he would benefit from being

given the chance to demonstrate his commitment to remain law

abiding with the assistance of Probation.                        The following

article is instructive:

       The concept of probation, from the Latin word probatio - meaning testing period - has
       historical roots in the practice of judicial reprieve. In English Common Law the Courts
       could temporarily suspend the execution of a sentence to allow the defendant to appeal
       to the Crown for a pardon. Probation first developed in the United States when John
       Augustus, a Boston boot maker, persuaded a judge in the Boston Police Court in 1841
       to give him custody of a convicted offender, a "drunkard," for a brief period and then
       helped the man to appear rehabilitated by the time of sentencing. Even before John
       Augustus, the practice of suspended sentence was used as early as 1830, in Boston,
       Massachusetts and became widespread in U.S. Courts, although there was no statutory
       authorization for such a practice. At first, judges used "release on recognizance" or bail
       and simply failed to take any further legal action. By the mid-19th century, however,
       many Federal Courts were using a judicial reprieve to suspend sentence, and this posed
       a legal question. In 1916, the United States Supreme Court held that a Federal Judge
       (Killets) was without power to suspend a sentence indefinitely. This famous court
       decision led to the passing of the National Probation Act of 1925, thereby, allowing
       courts to suspend the imposition of a sentence and place an offender on probation, ...

       Massachusetts developed the first statewide probation system in 1880, and by 1920, 21
       other states had followed suit. With the passage of the National Probation Act on March
       5, 1925, signed by President Calvin Coolidge, the U.S./Federal Probation Service was
       established to serve the U.S. Courts. On the state level, pursuant to the Crime Control
       and Consent Act passed by Congress in 1936, a group of states entered into agreement
       by which they would supervise probationers and parolees for each other known as the
       Interstate Compact For the Supervision of Parolees and Probationers, the agreement was
       originally signed by 25 states in 1937. In 1951, all the states in the United States of
       America had a working probation system and ratified the Interstate Compact
       Agreement. In 1959, the newly adopted states, Alaska and Hawaii, in addition the
       Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands and the territories of Guam and
       America Samoa ratified the act as well.

       Probation began as a humanitarian effort to allow first-time and minor offenders a
       second chance. Early probationers were expected not only to obey the law but also to
       behave in a morally acceptable fashion. Officers sought to provide moral leadership to
       help shape probationers' attitudes and behavior with respect to family, religion,
       employment, and free time. They aimed to ensure that this was enforced as well, and
       early probationers were given the opportunity to prove themselves and possibly even
       reduce their sentence.

      Mr. Torres would welcome the opportunity to prove to this

Honorable Court that he can return to being a law abiding

productive member of society. He recognizes that he must be

punished for his actions but he respectfully asks that any

punishment be tempered to reflect his individual conduct rather

than that of a statistical generalization.




                                    CONCLUSION

      WHEREFORE, defendant Edwin Torres respectfully requests

this Honorable Court to sentence him to a year and a day with 3

years of supervised release. He further requests that the Court

find that he has no ability to pay a fine.                      Such a reasonable

sentence would be warranted in the interest of justice.
