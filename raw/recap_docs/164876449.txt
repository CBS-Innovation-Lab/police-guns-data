      On February 19, 2021, the United States Magistrate Judge filed with the

court, with copies to the parties, his Recommended Decision on 28 U.S.C. ยง 2255

Motion.   The petitioner filed his objection to the Recommended Decision on

March 15, 2021. I have reviewed and considered the Recommended Decision,

together with the entire record; I have made a de novo determination of all

matters adjudicated by the Recommended Decision; and I concur with the

recommendations of the United States Magistrate Judge for the reasons set forth

in the Recommended Decision, and determine that no further proceeding is

necessary.

      It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the Magistrate

Judge is hereby ADOPTED.

      The motion for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. ยง 2255 is DENIED without an

evidentiary hearing.
