                                   RECOMMENDED DECISION

       Thomas Paul Brichetto, Jr., has filed a motion pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6) and Rule

60(d)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, requesting that this court re-open and

reconsider the motion he filed under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, which motion the court denied in

December 2006.1 Brichetto alleges that constitutional error underlies his 32-year sentence and

that a grave miscarriage of justice will result if he is not heard. (Motion to Re-Open, ECF No.

151.) Additionally, Brichetto has filed a motion requesting that I recuse myself from considering

his Rule 60 motion. In support of the recusal motion Brichetto contends, inaccurately, that I

previously recused in connection with his original section 2255 motion. (Motion for Recusal,

ECF No. 159.)

       The motion requesting my recusal is denied. As for the merits of the motion to reopen,

although it is styled a motion under Rule 60, in fact it amounts to a second or successive section

2255 motion. Consequently, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the motion until such time

as a panel of the First Circuit Court of Appeals should certify that his motion raises a new rule of

constitutional law, previously unavailable and made retroactive to cases on collateral review by

the Supreme Court. 28 U.S.C. §§ 2244(a), 2255(h)(2).2

                                                BACKGROUND

        On January 5, 2004, a jury found Brichetto guilty of violating 18 U.S.C. §§ 2113(a),

2113(d), and 2 (count I—bank robbery and aiding and abetting bank robbery); guilty of

violating 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) (count II—using, carrying, and brandishing a firearm

during and in relation to the commission of a violent felony); and not guilty of violating 18

U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1) and 924(e) (count III—felon in possession of a firearm). On May 19, 2004,

the court entered judgment, imposing a 300-month term of imprisonment on count I and an 84-

month term of imprisonment on count II, to be served concurrently. (Judgment, ECF No. 119.)

In a memorandum of sentencing judgment, the court concluded that Brichetto was convicted of

more than two prior felony crimes of violence and met the additional requirements of the career

offender guideline found in United States Sentencing Guidelines § 4B1.1. Consequently, the

court elevated the guidelines offense level to 34 instead of using the otherwise applicable

adjusted offense level of 26. (Mem. of Sentencing Judgment, ECF No. 119.) The court found a

criminal history category of VI, resulting in a guideline range for count I of between 262 and 327

months. (Id.)

        On direct appeal Brichetto challenged the court’s failure to direct a verdict in his favor or

grant a new trial based on the seeming inconsistency between the jury’s verdict concerning count

II and count III. The Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions. (ECF No. 130.)

        On March 13, 2006, Brichetto filed his first motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his

sentence pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 2255. (See Case No. 2:06-CV-00057-GC.) On April 24, 2006,

         Newly discovered evidence can also support a second or successive motion, 28 U.S.C. § 2255(h)(1), but
Brichetto’s motion to reopen does not suggest the existence of such evidence.

after I issued an order instructing the United States to answer Brichetto’s motion, Brichetto filed

a motion for my recusal, complaining that he felt I exhibited “prejudice and bias” years earlier

when I sentenced him, as a state court judge, for violation of probation and when I ruled against

him in connection with a post-conviction review proceeding. (ECF No. 5.) Brichetto’s motion

for my recusal was never granted. Instead, Judge Carter mooted the motion based on his

decision to simply handle the habeas motion directly, without referring it for report and

recommendation. (ECF No. 6.) Judge Carter denied Brichetto’s section 2255 motion on the

merits, rejecting, among other arguments, an assertion that he had erred in treating certain prior

convictions as crimes of violence and not submitting the question to the jury. The court’s

primary rationale was that Brichetto failed to preserve the arguments on direct appeal and failed

to argue any exceptions to the procedural default rule. (ECF No. 12.) However, as to a claim of

ineffective assistance of counsel, the court addressed the merits of Brichetto’s assertion that his

counsel erred by failing to argue that a Maine burglary conviction was not a crime of violence.

Relying on First Circuit precedent that has since been overturned3, the court concluded that the

law was clear that a conviction under Maine’s burglary statute amounted to a crime of violence

and that, consequently, counsel was not ineffective for failing to argue otherwise. (Id. at 9-10.)

        On February 4, 2011, Brichetto filed a motion for writ of error coram nobis, which can be

found on the instant docket, case number 2:03-CR-00024-GZS. (ECF No. 134.) On February

11, 2011, I issued a report and recommended decision advising the court to summarily dismiss

the motion because it amounted to a second or successive habeas petition and the court lacked

jurisdiction to hear it. (ECF No. 138.) The court agreed and adopted the recommendation.

(ECF No. 142.) The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal in June 2011 in the absence of a

showing by Brichetto that reasonable jurists could find the dismissal debatable or wrong. (ECF

No. 149.)

       Brichetto filed his current motion on July 8, 2013. (ECF No. 151.) In this motion he

requests that the court reopen the section 2255 motion he filed in March 2006, pursuant to Rule

60(b) and Rule 60(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, based on legal developments that

transpired in the interim, discussed below.

                                              DISCUSSION

       For reasons that follow, the motion for recusal is denied and the court is advised to

dismiss Brichetto’s Rule 60 motion.

A.     Motion for Recusal (ECF No. 159)

       The law requires that a judicial officer recuse, or disqualify himself or herself, “in any

proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.” 28 U.S.C. § 455(a). The

statute lists additional, specific circumstances where disqualification is mandatory, including

circumstances involving personal bias or prejudice toward a party. Id. § 455(b)(1). “[J]udicial

rulings alone almost never constitute a valid basis for a bias or partiality motion.” Liteky v.

United States, 510 U.S. 540, 555 (1994). Moreover, “opinions formed by the judge on the basis

of facts introduced or events occurring in the course of the current proceedings, or of prior

proceedings, do not constitute a basis for a bias or partiality motion unless they display a deep-

seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible.” Id. “[J]udicial

remarks during the course of a trial that are critical or disapproving of, or even hostile to,

counsel, the parties, or their cases, ordinarily do not support a bias or partiality challenge.” Id.;

See also United States v. Pulido, 566 F.3d 52, 64 (1st Cir. 2009) (finding no appearance of

partiality in judge’s assessment in a related case that the defendant was “thoroughly corrupt” and



                                                   4
Case 2:03-cr-00024-GZS Document 162 Filed 08/28/13 Page 5 of 9                         PageID #: 1340



judge’s subsequent statement at the defendant’s sentencing that the defendant was “utterly

without redeeming qualities”).

       Contrary to Brichetto’s representation, there was no prior recusal on my part. A review

of the docket entries indicates merely that Brichetto sought my recusal when he first filed a

section 2255 motion. Brichetto’s motion was never granted. Rather, it was mooted when Judge

Carter indicated that he would address Brichetto’s motion directly. Thereafter, Judge Carter

issued an order on Brichetto’s original section 2255 motion, without referring the matter for

report and recommendation. Subsequently, I issued a recommended decision in connection with

Brichetto’s petition for a writ of error coram nobis. (ECF No. 138.) There is no reason why I

should not have done so. Nor am I aware of any grounds upon which I should recuse myself

from considering Brichetto’s current motion to reopen his section 2255 motion. I bear no bias or

prejudice toward Brichetto and see no reasonable basis upon which my impartiality could be

questioned.

        Brichetto claims that I presided, as a state court judge, over a sentencing hearing

associated with a violation of probation, conducted in 1996, and a post-conviction review

proceeding. (Aff. in Support of 2006 Recusal Mot., ¶¶ 8-11, Case No. 2:06-cv-00057, ECF No.

5-1.) Although I have no personal recollection of these events, the fact that I presided over state

proceedings involving Brichetto may well be true. In any event, that fact in no way undermines

my ability to consider, impartially, the current pleadings, which arise from a 2003 conviction

before Judge Carter on unrelated federal charges.

B.     Motion to Re-Open (ECF No. 151)

       Brichetto’s latest filing is subject to a statutory bar that restricts the ability of prisoners to

pursue multiple habeas motions or petitions challenging the same federal conviction or sentence.



                                                   5
Case 2:03-cr-00024-GZS Document 162 Filed 08/28/13 Page 6 of 9                       PageID #: 1341



In 1996, Congress enacted the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), Pub.

L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, which, among other things, introduced a bar against a federal

prisoner filing a second or successive habeas motion absent certification by the appropriate court

of appeals that the motion contained either (1) newly discovered evidence capable of establishing

by a clear and convincing evidentiary standard that no reasonable factfinder would have found

the prisoner guilty or (2) “a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral

review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.” 28 U.S.C. § 2255(h)

(referencing the certification requirement of 28 U.S.C. § 2244). Pursuant to this statutory

provision, a district court lacks jurisdiction to address the merits of a second or successive habeas

motion attacking the constitutionality of a federal conviction or sentence “unless and until the

court of appeals has decreed that it may go forward.” Trenkler v. United States, 536 F.3d 85, 96

(1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Pratt v. United States, 129 F.3d 54, 57 (1st Cir. 1997)). See also 28

U.S.C. § 2244(b)(3)(A) (“Before a second or successive application permitted by this section is

filed in the district court, the applicant shall move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order

authorizing the district court to consider the application.”); Rules Governing Section 2255

Cases, Rule 9 (imposing the same requirement).

       Brichetto attempts to avoid the jurisdictional bar raised by section 2255(h) by advancing

his motion not as a 2255 motion, but rather as a Rule 60 motion for relief from Judge Carter’s

2006 order denying his initial section 2255 motion. Brichetto relies on subsections (b)(6) and (d)

of Rule 60, which permit the court to “relieve a party . . . from a final judgment” or “entertain an

independent action” for that purpose for, essentially, any reason not otherwise identified in the

Rule. Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b), (d). However, the Rule runs headlong into the section 2255(h) bar

because Brichetto’s Rule 60 motion is, in substance, a renewed section 2255(a) motion asserting



                                                  6
Case 2:03-cr-00024-GZS Document 162 Filed 08/28/13 Page 7 of 9                    PageID #: 1342



that his sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or was in excess of the maximum

authorized by law.

       “Any motion filed in the district court that imposed the sentence, and substantively within

the scope of § 2255 [paragraph] 1, is a motion under § 2255, no matter what title the prisoner

plasters on the cover.” Trenkler, 536 F.3d at 97 (emphasis in original) (quoting Melton v. United

States, 359 F.3d 855, 857 (7th Cir. 2004)). In fact, the First Circuit Court of Appeals has

pointedly held that a Rule 60(b) motion challenging the constitutionality of an underlying

conviction or sentence should be treated as a second or successive filing under the AEDPA

where the predicate for the Rule 60(b) motion “constitutes a direct challenge to the

constitutionality of the underlying conviction.” Munoz v. United States, 331 F.3d 151, 152 (1st

Cir. 2003) (per curiam) (involving a 2255 motion); Rodwell v. Pepe, 324 F.3d 66, 70 (1st Cir.

2003) (involving a 2254 petition).

       Brichetto’s Rule 60 motion is predicated on a change in circuit precedent related to

whether a non-residential burglary amounts to a crime of violence under sentencing guideline

4B1.1 (the career offender guideline), see United States v. Giggey, 551 F.3d 27, 28 (1st Cir.

2008) (en banc) (holding that such burglaries are not per se crimes of violence and that

determination of the issue “turns on the application of a categorical approach under §

4B1.2(a)(2)’s residual clause”), and a recent Supreme Court opinion related to whether a

California burglary conviction could be treated as a “violent felony” under the Armed Career

Criminal Act based on application of a “modified categorical approach,” Descamps v. United

States, 133 S. Ct. 2276, 2293 (2013) (holding that the modified categorical approach amounted

to improper judicial factfinding because the California burglary statute contained a single,

indivisible set of elements that did not include unlawful entry, a generic burglary element, such



                                                 7
Case 2:03-cr-00024-GZS Document 162 Filed 08/28/13 Page 8 of 9                                       PageID #: 1343



that a conviction under the statute “is never for generic burglary”). Brichetto believes that if the

teachings of Descamps and Giggey were retroactively applied to his sentencing, then none of his

non-residential burglary predicates4 would be a crime of violence and he might achieve a

substantially reduced sentence by avoiding the career offender enhancement. (Motion to Reopen

at 3-7.) The argument is clearly a direct challenge to the constitutionality and legality of the

sentence imposed by the court and, therefore, should be treated as a second or successive filing

under the AEDPA.5

                                                    CONCLUSION

         Brichetto’s motion for recusal (ECF No. 159) is denied. As for his motion to reopen

(ECF No. 151), I recommend that the Court deny the motion without prejudice to Brichetto’s

right to file a new 28 U.S.C. § 2255 motion should he ever obtain the First Circuit Court of

Appeal’s certification to do so. I further recommend that a certificate of appealability should not

issue in the event Brichetto files a notice of appeal because there is no substantial showing of the

denial of a constitutional right within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c).



                                                       NOTICE

                 A party may file objections to those specified portions of a magistrate
         judge's report or proposed findings or recommended decisions entered pursuant to
         28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B) for which de novo review by the district court is sought,
         together with a supporting memorandum, within fourteen (14) days of being
         served with a copy thereof. A responsive memorandum shall be filed within
         fourteen (14) days after the filing of the objection.

4
          It is not entirely clear how many such burglaries are at issue, but it appears there was at least one. Nor is it
clear, or necessary to determine at this time, whether there were sufficient other convictions in Brichetto’s criminal
history to support the career offender status.
5
          In a post-reply filing dated August 26, 2013 (ECF No. 161), Brichetto asks that the court take judicial
notice of United States v. Edwards, ___ F.3d ___, 2013 U.S. App. Lexis 16936, 2013 WL 4105532 (9th Cir. Aug. 8,
2013), in which, he says, the Ninth Circuit invoked its authority under Rule 60(b) to reopen a habeas proceeding and
remand for resentencing based on application of Descamps. In fact, the Edwards Court addressed a Descamps issue
on direct appeal. The Court’s opinion has nothing whatsoever to say about second or successive collateral attacks
disguised as Rule 60(b) motions.

             Failure to file a timely objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to de
      novo review by the district court and to appeal the district court's order.
