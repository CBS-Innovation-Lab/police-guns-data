                 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                      DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

            v.                                 Case No. 07-cr-49-01-SM

Anthony R. Capobianco


                                      ORDER



      Defendant's assented-to motion to continue the trial (document no. 25) is granted.

Trial has been rescheduled for the December 2007 trial period. Defendant shall file a

Waiver of Speedy Trial Rights not later than November 13, 2007. On the filing of such

waiver, his continuance shall be effective.

      The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance outweigh

the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ยง

3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would unreasonably deny the

defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective preparation taking into account
