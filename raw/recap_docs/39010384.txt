       Pursuant to Local Rule 116.5(b), the parties submit the following interim status report:

       The government has provided automatic discovery by mail on June 18, 2018 and July 5,

       2.       Timing of additional discovery.

       The government continues to investigate, and if additional reports or information are

received, they will be provided as soon as received. Additional laboratory reports are anticipated

as the laboratory completes drug and firearm analyses.

       3.       Timing of additional discovery requests.

       The defendants continue to review the discovery produced to date, and do not yet know if

they will be making additional discovery requests.

       4.       Protective orders.

       A protective order regarding discovery containing confidential informant information

was issued by the court on July 2, 2018.

       5.       Pretrial motions.

       The defendants have not filed any pretrial motions under Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b). Mr.

Torres anticipates filing such pretrial motions in the near future. The Court may wish to consider

establishing a date by which such motions should be filed.

       6.       Timing of expert disclosures.

       The Court has not yet established a date for expert witness disclosures. The government

submits that drug and firearm analysts will be the expert witnesses likely to be called by the

government. Accordingly, the government submits that expert disclosures 30 days before trial

should be sufficient.

       7.       Defenses of insanity, public authority or alibi.

       No such defenses are currently anticipated.

       8.       Periods of excludable delay.

       The time from May 23, 2018 until July 12, 2018 was excluded under the Speedy Trial

Act by order of the Court. (Docket No. 27). The time from July 12, 2018 through September 6,

2018 was excluded under the Speedy Trial Act by order of the Court. (Docket No. 39).

Accordingly, zero days of non-excludable time have accrued and 70 days will remain under the

Act in which the case must be tried.

       9.       Status of plea discussions and estimated length of trial.

       Defendants continue to work through the discovery, and no plea discussions have taken

place to date. The government estimates that the length of trial would be one week.

       10.      Timing of further conferences.

       The parties request that a further status conference be scheduled for approximately 60

days from August 30, 2018.

                                                 Respectfully submitted,
