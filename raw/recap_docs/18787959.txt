                 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                      DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

            v.                               Case No. 05-cr-184-01-SM

Theoun So

                                    ORDER

      Defendant So’s motion to continue the final pretrial conference and trial is

granted (document 26). Trial has been rescheduled for the November 2006

trial period. Defendant So shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights not later

than August 25, 2006. On the filing of such waiver, his continuance shall be

effective. No further continuances shall be granted without exceptional

circumstances having been shown.

      The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18

U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would

unreasonably deny defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances.

      Final Pretrial Conference: October 26, 2006 at 3:30 p.m.

      Jury Selection: November 7, 2006 at 9:30 a.m.
