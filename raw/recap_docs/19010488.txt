                 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                      DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America,
      Plaintiff

            v.
                                        Case No. 12-cr-007-04-SM

Joseph Hasan,
      Defendant

                                ORDER


      Defendant Hasan’s assented-to motion to continue the final

pretrial conference and trial is granted (document no. 50).

Trial has been rescheduled for the month of September 2012.

Defendant Hasan shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights not

later than August 20, 2012.

      The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting

a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A) and (B), in

that failure to grant a continuance would unreasonably deny the

defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective prepara-

tion taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances.

      A Change of Plea Hearing or if necessary, a Final Pretrial

Conference, is rescheduled for September 11, 2012 at 9:30 a.m.
