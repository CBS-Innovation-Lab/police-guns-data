                            DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

             v.                                 Case No. 06-cr-12-01, 02-SM

Starr Parrish, et al




                                        ORDER



       Defendant's assented-to motion to continue the trial (document no. 17) is granted.

Trial has been rescheduled for the July 2006 trial period. Defendant shall file a Waiver of

Speedy Trial Rights not later than April 25, 2006. On the filing of such waiver, his

the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ยง

3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would unreasonably deny the

defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective preparation taking into account the
