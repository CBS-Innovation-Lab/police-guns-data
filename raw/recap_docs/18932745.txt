                   UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                        DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America,
      Plaintiff

              v.                              CR. 09-cr-189-01-SM

David Clement,
     Defendant

                                     ORDER


        Defendant Clement’s motion to continue the trial is granted (document no.

9).     Trial has been rescheduled for the April 2010 trial period. Defendant

Clement shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights not later than February 19,

2010.     On the filing of such waiver, his continuance shall be effective.

        The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial,

18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would

unreasonably deny the defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances.
