ANGEL ENRIQUE ROMERO-GALINDEZ
Petitioner

       v.                                     Civil No. 15-1043 (DRD)

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Respondent



                                 OPINION & ORDER

       Pending      before    the     Court   is    Petitioner       Angel     Enrique

Romero-Galindez        Motion    to    Vacate,     Set   Aside,     or   Correct       the

sentence imposed in criminal case 3:12-cr-00319. See Docket Nos.

1 and 5; see also 28 U.S.C. § 2255. For the reasons provided

below, the Court DENIES Petitioner’s Motion to Vacate, Set Aside

or Correct Sentence (Docket Nos. 1 and 5).

                         I.     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

  On        April     24,     2012,      Angel       Enrique        Romero-Galindez

(“Petitioner”)          was         charged        under       18        U.S.C.          §

922(g)(1)(prohibited          person     in   possession     of      firearm      by     a

convicted     felon)    for     unlawfully    possessing     “an     AK-47     assault

rifle, bearing serial number AH-1685-1989, one (1) magazine, and

a total of eleven (11) rounds of 7.62 caliber ammunitions.” See

Response in Opposition to Motion at Docket No. 7. On November 5,

2012, Petitioner pled guilty on January 18, 2013 to count one

(1) of the indictment. See Docket No. 1. The parties agreed to

recommend a sentence of fifteen (15) years if Petitioner was
      Case 3:12-cr-00319-DRD Document 108 Filed 07/14/16 Page 2 of 13



found to be an Armed Career Criminal. See 18, U.S.C. §922(g)(1)

and 924(e).

  On August 19, 2013, the Court found that Petitioner was an

Armed Career Criminal and sentenced Petitioner to two hundred

and forty (240) months of imprisonment and five (5) years of

supervised release. See Docket No. 1. The judgement against the

Petitioner was entered on August 26, 2013, and he appealed said

judgement on September 9, 2013. On April 3, 2015, Petitioner’s

conviction was affirmed by the First Circuit.

  On January 21, 2015, Petitioner filed the instant Motion to

Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence. See Docket Nos. 1 and 5.

Petitioner claims he received ineffective assistance of counsel,

primarily during the plea negotiation process. Petitioner also

avers that the Court erred in considering his prior convictions

and consequently increasing the mandatory minimum at sentencing.

Petitioner also requests the Court’s recusal from the instant

case. Finally, Petitioner requests the appointment of counsel

and   an   evidentiary       hearing.   The   United   States   of   America

(“Respondent”) filed its Response in Opposition to Motion on

June 4, 2015. See Docket No. 7.

                       II.     APPLICABLE STANDARD

                  i.     Legal Standard Under § 2255

      Under § 2255, a prisoner prevails on his motion to vacate,

set aside, or correct a sentence if the petitioner proves one of

        Case 3:12-cr-00319-DRD Document 108 Filed 07/14/16 Page 3 of 13



the following: (i) “the sentence was imposed in violation of the

Constitution or laws of the United States,” (ii) “the court was

without     jurisdiction     to     impose         such    sentence,”          (iii)    “the

sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law,” or

(iv) the sentence “is otherwise subject to collateral attack.”

28 U.S.C. § 2255(a).

        Petitioner’s    §    2255      action       is     based     on    the     alleged

ineffective        assistance       of    counsel          he      received       in      the

aforementioned criminal case.             The Court accepts that, “[i]n all

criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to . .

. have the assistance of counsel for his defense.”                             U.S. Const.

Amend.     VI.    However,      “not     every      lawyerly        slip       constitutes

ineffective assistance of counsel for Sixth Amendment purposes.”

Prou v. United States, 199 F.3d 37, 48 (1st Cir. 1999) (citing

Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 693 (1984)).                                   “After

all,     the     Constitution     entitles          a     defendant       to     generally

proficient       representation,       not       perfect    representation.”             Id.

(citing Scarpa v. DuBois, 38 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1994)).                                 The

First     Circuit      succinctly        summarized         the      legal       doctrines

surrounding claims of ineffective assistance of counsel:

             “A convicted defendant's claim that counsel's
        assistance was so defective as to require reversal of
        a conviction ... has two components.” Strickland v.
        Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80
        L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). First, the defendant must show
        that    counsel's    performance   was    objectively
        unreasonable “under prevailing professional norms.”


                                             3
     Case 3:12-cr-00319-DRD Document 108 Filed 07/14/16 Page 4 of 13



     Id. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. In making this assessment,
     courts must be “highly deferential” and “indulge a
     strong presumption that ... under the circumstances,
     the challenged action might be considered sound trial
     strategy.” Id. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (internal
     quotation marks omitted); accord Woods v. Donald, –––
     U.S. ––––, 135 S.Ct. 1372, 1375, 191 L.Ed.2d 464
     (2015) (per curiam). Second, the defendant must show
     that counsel's deficient performance resulted in
     prejudice—that is, “that there is a reasonable
     probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional
     errors, the result of the proceeding would have been
     different.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct.
     2052; accord Woods, 135 S.Ct. at 1375.

United States v. Mercedes-De La Cruz, 787 F.3d 61 (1st Cir.

2015).

There is also no question that “a defendant has a right to be

informed by his counsel of a plea offer. Ordinarily, counsel's

failure to do so constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.”

United States v. Rodriguez Rodriguez, 929 F.2d 747, 752 (1st

Cir. 1991).

     ii.   Legal Standards Governing Motions for Disqualification

     The   First   Circuit    has   held    that   a   judge    must   be

disqualified, or recuse him or herself, when the facts alleged

against him “provide what an objective, knowledgeable member of

the public would find to be a reasonable basis for doubting the

judge's impartiality.” In re Boston's Children First, 244 F.3d

164, 167 (1st Cir.2001) (quoting In re United States, 666 F.2d

690, 695 (1st Cir.1998)). The First Circuit has also held that

“doubts ordinarily ought to be resolved in favor of recusal.” In



                                    4
       Case 3:12-cr-00319-DRD Document 108 Filed 07/14/16 Page 5 of 13



re    United     States,        441   F.3d    44,    56–57   (1st   Cir.2006).      The

analysis then turns on whether “an objective, reasonable member

of the public, fully informed of all the relevant facts, would

fairly question the trial judge's impartiality.” Id. (emphasis

ours). Although the reasonable appearance of partiality requires

the judge to recuse himself, “[t]his does not mean that required

recusal can be based on an unsupported, irrational, or highly

tenuous speculation.'” In re Martinez–Catala, 129 F.3d at 220

(emphasis ours).

       Furthermore,        it    is   worth       noting   that   friction   with    a

litigant is rarely grounds for recusal. Ordinarily, it is not

sufficient that the presiding judge make critical remarks or

comments directed at a party or his attorney, or that there were

other indications of animosity or friction. See King v. First

American Investigations, Inc., 287 F.3d 91, 96 (2d Cir. 2002),

the judicial process, referred to plaintiff as paranoid, accused

plaintiff of “pulling a stunt” in attempting to make a showing

recusal.); Christo v. Padgett, 223 F.3d 1324, 1333–1334 (11th

very quickly.)(emphasis ours); and Mitchell v. Kirk, 20 F.3d 936

were    attempts       to   maintain       control       over   proceedings       and    to

preserve courtroom decorum; judge never commented on merits of

inmate's case, and only remarked on inmate's presentation of his

case and his courtroom antics). With the above legal standards

established, the Court moves to decide the matters at hand.

   A. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel

      Case 3:12-cr-00319-DRD Document 108 Filed 07/14/16 Page 7 of 13



      Petitioner claims that the first prong of the Strickland

test is met since counsel lied to the court about presenting him

the two plea deals offered by the government. See Docket No. 1.

The   Court   finds    this   to   be   a       lackluster    argument    since   the

Petitioner recognized on the record that he planned to discuss

the government’s second plea offer with his family. Petitioner

also alleges that he was not offered this first plea agreement,

but   the     record   clearly     reflects         that     counsel     did   advise

Petitioner of the two (2) plea deals

           MR. CANINO: This case has a history or had a
      history of [protracted] plea negotiations. We had two
      plea offers at one time. We discussed both with our
      client.
           We understand that he is in a position to accept
      one of those plea offers. However, he informed us
      yesterday that he is not ready to sign the Plea
      Agreement today, that he would like time to counsel
      with his family.

           - - -
           MS. ZENON: Your Honor, this is like the fourth or
      fifth time we have been in a Change of Plea Hearing
      that I believe so.
           Previously, we were in a hearing in Judge
      Domínguez’ courtroom about this case. The two plea
      offers were made sometime ago.
           We believe that the Defendant had certainly
      enough time to consider the offers, and to speak with
      his family members.
           - - -
           THE COURT: Okay so you plan is to discuss this
      second plea offer with your family next time they
      visit you?
           DEFENDANT: Yes, and so that they will come here
      too.
           THE COURT: Okay, and did you discuss, with your
      Attorney, this second offer yesterday?
           DEFENDANT: Yes.

Criminal case 3:12-cr-00319 Docket No. 90, pp. 2, 3, 4).

The record also reflects that Petitioner was cooperating with

the government and communicating to finalize the plea agreement.

See criminal case 3:12-cr-00319 Docket Nos. 18, 23, 36, 46 and

the Presentence Report (“PSR”) at 69.

        Petitioner asserts that he received ineffective assistance

of counsel because counsel filed a sentencing memorandum seeking

variance from the plea agreement. See Docket. No. 5. However, it

was established in the PSR that if Petitioner was found to be an

Armed Career Criminal, the sentencing guideline would be between

the   statutory      minimum     fifteen       (15)    years   and     life.         The   PSR

ultimately recommended a sentence between one hundred and eighty

(180) to two hundred and ten (210) months. The argument posed,

thus,    is    incorrect    as     prior   counsel       was   seeking         the    lowest

possible sentence under the guidelines, as established in the

plea agreement. Counsel did not violate what was stipulated in

the plea agreement by seeking the mandatory minimum.1 By arguing

for a fifteen-year (15) minimum sentence, counsel was advocating

in favor of the lowest possible sentence for his client.

        Notwithstanding      the      above,     Petitioner        also    argues          that

counsel       did   not   object      to   the   Court       relying      on    incorrect

sentencing      guidelines       to   sentence        him.   See    Id.    Although         “a
1
  Due to prior serious crimes, Petitioner qualified as an Armed Career
Criminal which mandated a sentence between fifteen (15) years and life in
prison. See 18, U.S.C. §922(g)(1) and 924(e).


                                            8
        Case 3:12-cr-00319-DRD Document 108 Filed 07/14/16 Page 9 of 13



sentencing      court    must     ‘give    respectful     consideration      to   the

Guidelines, Booker permits the court to tailor the sentence in

light of other statutory concerns as well.’ ” Pepper v. United

States, 562 U.S. 476 (2011) (referring United States v. Booker,

543    U.S.     220     (2005))    (emphasis      ours)    (internal     citations

omitted). In this case, the Court opted to apply a statutory

sentence due to all the factors on the record which the Court

found mandates a more serious sentence for Petitioner in order

to deter further criminal conduct. Counsel then did not fail to

object     to    “incorrect”       sentencing        guidelines    and    did     not

prejudice       the   Petitioner’s        defense.    Accordingly,     the   second

prong of the Strickland test which states that “for counsel's

unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have

been    different”      is   pellucidly     not    satisfied.     Strickland,     466

U.S. at 694.

      B. Prior Convictions

      Petitioner claims that the Court showed prejudice against him

by considering the lenient sentence provided prior as to his

four (4) past         murder convictions          as grounds to increase the

present sentence. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1) provides that a Court

must take into account Petitioner’s history and characteristics

in applying a just sentence. See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1). It is

also well established that “logic dictates that a sentencing

court may ... consider whether, in a series of past convictions,


                                            9
        Case 3:12-cr-00319-DRD Document 108 Filed 07/14/16 Page 10 of 13



the    punishment    appears     to   fit        the    crime.”        United       States   v.

Flores–Machicote, 706 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir. 2013). Then, “if the

court concludes that an asymmetry exists which results                                   in a

substantial underestimation of the defendant's criminal history,

it may vary the sentence upward to reflect past leniency.” Id.

(internal       citations    omitted).       Consequently,             the   Court      acted

within its discretion by taking into account the past leniency

in the Petitioner’s conviction.

        Nonetheless, Petitioner claims that the past convictions

had to be brought before the jury before being considered by the

government as they were “elements of the crime”. The Supreme

Court decided that any fact that increased the mandatory minimum

sentence and was considered an element of the crime, had to be

brought before the jury. See Alleyne v. United States, 133 S.Ct.

2151 (2013). This does not apply in the present case since the

prior     convictions       Petitioner   had           are   considered         “sentencing

factors” and not “elements of the crime”. The Supreme Court held

that    prior    convictions     could   be       used       to   enhance       a    sentence

without being brought before a jury. See Almendarez–Torres v.

United States, 523 U.S. 224, (1998) (“There is not sufficient

support,      in    this      Court's    precedents               or    elsewhere,           for

petitioner's claim that the Constitution requires Congress to

treat recidivism as an element of the offense irrespective of

Congress' contrary intent.”). The Petitioner’s argument that his


                                            10
     Case 3:12-cr-00319-DRD Document 108 Filed 07/14/16 Page 11 of 13



counsel     failed   to    object    the      convictions   being      used   as

sentencing factors and that the Court acted with prejudice in

using them is, thus, without merit.

   C. Recusal

   The issue of whether or not the Court should recuse itself

from deciding Petitioner’s motion due to bias has already been

decided by the Court of Appeals. See U.S. v. Romero-Galindez 782

F.3d 63, 71 (1st Cir. 2015). “On a motion to vacate sentence (or

judgment) we will not re-review grounds for relief previously

considered and determined. As to these grounds, petitioner is

not entitled to another review.” Dirring v. United States, 370

F.2d 862, 864 (1st Cir. 1967) (internal citations omitted). It

was also clarified that “although the strict doctrine of res

adjudicata    does   not   apply    to    §   2255   motions,   it   is    firmly

settled that issues disposed of on a prior appeal will not be

reviewed again by way of such a motion.” Id. (internal citations

omitted).     Nonetheless,     for       finality     purposes,      the   Court

entertains Petitioner’s claim.

   The First Circuit’s opinion reads as follows:

          Here, the judge unambiguously indicated that he
     was not going with a Guidelines sentence for a variety
     of reasons (more fully discussed below). This is not
     the same as disregarding the Guidelines as a starting
     point. At the sentencing hearing, the judge distinctly
     went through the Guidelines computation, detailing
     Romero–Galindez's   base    offense   level,  criminal
     history,   status  as    an   armed  career  criminal,
     acceptance of responsibility, total offense level, and


                                         11
        Case 3:12-cr-00319-DRD Document 108 Filed 07/14/16 Page 12 of 13



        guideline sentence range. The judge indicated that he
        had reviewed the PSR and its Guidelines computations,
        as well as the sentencing factors set forth in 18
        U.S.C.   §  3553.   Far  from   indicating   inadequate
        attention to the Guidelines, the record shows that the
        court   considered   the  option   presented   by   the
        Guidelines (even if they may have been calculated
        incorrectly) and then, for clearly enumerated reasons,
        rejected it as producing an overly lenient sentence.
        This was an option well within its prerogative to
        take.


Romero-Galindez 782 F.3d 63, 71

The First Circuit also stated that “the sentencing transcript

shows     that    the     judge,      as    opposed       to    fretting        over    public

opinion, was concerned with the fact that a lenient or so-called

soft sentence would not serve as a general deterrent. The judge

repeatedly made this point, questioning what disincentive value

a statutory minimum sentence would have”.                          Id.    at 72-73.        The

Court of Appeals clearly found that the Court had discretion to

enter the sentence based on the Petitioner’s four serious crimes

and   consequently         the       guideline     sentence       did     not    constitute

sufficient deterrent under federal law. See Id. 72-72 at * 11.

“Romero–Galindez          had    a    history      of    violent    crimes        and,    upon

impermissibly leaving the state custody that those crimes landed

him in, got his hands on an AK–47. We scarcely think it was

unreasonable for the district judge to think a statutory minimum

sentence was not adequate.” Id. at 73. Thus, the Court finds no

reasonable       reason    to    act       against      the    findings    of     the    First

Circuit and recuse itself from deciding Petitioner’s arguments.

See Dirring 370 F.2d at 864.

                           IV.   CONCLUSION2

    For all the reasons alluded above, this Court DENIES WITH

PREJUDICE Petitioner’s Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct

sentence.     See Docket Nos. 1 and 5. The Court further orders

that no certificate of appealability should be issued in the

event that Petitioner files a notice of appeal because there is

no substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right

within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. 2253(c) (2).

IT IS SO ORDERED.

      In San Juan, Puerto Rico, this 14th day of July, 2016.

  There is no question that the facts of this case, both the original and the
appellate, defeat the arguments made by Petitioner in this motion. “Thus, the
petition is subject to dismissal, without an evidentiary hearing, if the
grounds for relief either are not cognizable under section 2255 or amount to
mere “bald” assertions without sufficiently particular and supportive
allegations of fact.” Barrett v. United States, 965 F.2d 1184 (1st Cir.
1992). Therefore, the Court DENIES Petitioner’s request for an evidentiary
hearing.
