                        UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                          DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

V.                                                  Cr. No. 05-128 S

RICHARD ROMA

                MOTION FOR WITHDRAWEL OF APPEARANCE

       Now comes undersigned counsel, Andrew Berg, and hereby requests that this

honorable Court grant his Motion For Withdrawal Of Appearance as counsel for the

defendant, Richard Roma.

       As grounds for this Motion, undersigned counsel avers that Mr. Roma refuses to

confer with counsel regarding the Resentence Investigation Report, and his upcoming

sentencing. Accordingly, the attorney-client relationship has broken down to a point that

makes it impossible for undersigned counsel to provide effective representation.

       Undersigned counsel requests a hearing of this matter.

                                            Respectfully submitted,
                                                       A
