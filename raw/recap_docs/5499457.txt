STATEMENT 0F REASONS

VII COURT DETERM'INATIONS OF RES'I`ITUTION

A I:l Restitution Not Applicable.

B Total Amount of Restitution: 2’335 '68

C Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

1 l:l For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 13 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under iS U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3 )(A).

2 l:l For offenses for Which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
issues of fact and relating themto the cause or amount of the victims’ losses would complicate or proiong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(B).
3 l____l For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh

the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(l)(B)(ii).

4 l:l Restitution is not ordered for other reasons (Explain.)

D l:i PaItial restitution is ordered for these reasons (18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)):

VIII ADDITIONAL FACTS JUSTIFY]NG THE SENTENCE IN THIS CASE {lf applicable.)

THE COURT lMPOSED THE SENTENCE AFTER CONSIDERING ALL THE SURROUNDING CIRCUMSTANCES
AND THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT'S DETERMINATION AS TO THE ADVISORY GUIDELINE RANGE.

Sections I, ll, lll, IV, and Vll of the Statement of Reasons form must be completed in all felony cases.
