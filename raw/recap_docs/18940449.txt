                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE




United States of America

     v.                                       Criminal No.   09-cr-45-01-B

Scott Rogers



                                  O R D E R


     The defendant has moved to continue the May 4, 2010 trial in

the above case.      Defendant cites the need for additional time as

counsel was recently appointed and needs time to review

discovery.     The government does not object to a continuance of

the trial date.

     Accordingly, in order to allow the parties additional time

to properly prepare for trial, the court will continue the trial

from May 4, 2010 to July 7, 2010.           In agreeing to continue the

trial, the court finds pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(7)(A)

that for the above-stated reasons, the ends of justice served in

granting a continuance outweigh the best interests of the public

and the defendant in a speedy trial.

2010 at 2:00 pm.
