                        DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIR E


United States of Americ a

                v.    Case                 No . 07-cr-172-01-SM

Irving Cruz

                                      ORDER

       Defendant Cruz's motion to continue the final pretrial conference and tria l

is granted (document 8) . Trial has been rescheduled for the January 2008 trial

period . Defendant Cruz shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights not later than

November 9, 2007 . On the filing of such waiver, his continuance shall be

effective .

       The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18

U.S .C . ยง 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would

unreasonably deny defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances .

       Final Pretrial Conference : December 19, 2007 at 3 :30 p .m.

       Jury Selection : January 8, 2008 at 9 :30 a.m .
