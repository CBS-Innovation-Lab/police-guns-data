JAMONT F. DUBOSE

                         MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
                             May 13, 2011
SARIS, D.J.
                           I.   INTRODUCTION

     Now pending before this Court is defendant Jamont F.

Dubose’s (“Dubose”) “Affidavit to Vacate A.C.C.A. Enhancement”

(Docket No. 60).

     The relevant background is as follows.     On September 19,

2007, an Indictment was returned charging Dubose with being a

felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition in violation of

18 U.S.C. § 922(g).   During the criminal proceedings, an

evidentiary hearing was held on Dubose’s motion to suppress

evidence, and on March 31, 2008, this Court denied the motion.

See Memorandum and Order (Docket No. 27).

     On June 10, 2008, Dubose entered a change of plea and pled

guilty.   On October 2, 2008, this Court held a sentencing hearing

and sentenced Dubose to a term of imprisonment of 180 months,

imposing a sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (“ACCA”),

18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1).    See Judgment (Docket No. 39).   Dubose

filed a Notice of Appeal (Docket No. 40) on October 8, 2008.

Thereafter, an Amended Judgment (Docket No. 47) entered.

     On September 1, 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for
the First Circuit (“First Circuit”) affirmed this Court’s denial

of Dubose’s motion to suppress.   See Judgment (Docket No. 56);

Mandate (Docket No. 59, entered Oct. 20, 2009); United States v.

Dubose, No. 08-2382 (1st Cir. 2009).

     About 18 months later, on April 25, 2011, Dubose filed the

instant motion, entitled “Affidavit to Vacate A.C.C.A.

Enhancement” (Docket No. 60).   In the pleading, Dubose requests

this Court consider his motion for relief from his enhanced

sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582.   He alleges that his ACCA

sentence was imposed by this Court in error because one of the

predicate offenses, a Massachusetts (Dorchester Court)   assault

and battery on a police officer (“ABPO”) was based, improperly,

on a plea colloquy from this prior conviction.1   He maintains

that the factual evidence in this matter was sparse, particularly

in view of the fact that the Presentence Report stated that “no

information was available regarding this offense.”   Affidavit

(Docket No. 60 at 1).   He further contends that the only

information that properly could have been considered by this

Court did not establish that Dubose “necessarily” pled guilty to

facts constituting a “violent felony” as encompassed by the ACCA.

In light of this, Dubose claims that the Government had not met

 Dubose argues that the plea colloquy was concurrent with another
criminal case, involving a misdemeanor for simple assault, and
thus is not a basis for application of the ACCA.

                                  2
its initial burden of proving the predicate conviction.

     Next, Dubose argues that this Court erred in concluding that

every ABPO qualifies as a “violent felony” under the ACCA.   He

refers to First Circuit law indicating that ABPO in Massachusetts

does not categorically qualify as a “violent felony” for ACCA

purposes, where there can be both violent and non-violent crimes.

Specifically, Dubose cites to United States v. Brown, 510 F.3d 57

(1st Cir. 2007)(defendant’s purported offense of ABPO in

violation of Massachusetts law did not qualify as a predicate

offense under the ACCA).   The instant motion parrots some of the

language in that case.   Dubose also cites to LaFrenier v. Kinery,

478 F. Supp. 2d 126 (D. Mass. 2007)(defining ABPO under Mass.

Gen. Laws ch. 265, § 13D).2

     A fundamental problem with Dubose’s claim exists at the

outset, because a review of the Presentence Report (“PSR”) does

not reveal any predicate offenses of ABPO.3


2
 Cf. United States v. Dancy,--- F.3d ---, 2011 WL 1418854 (1st
Cir. Apr. 13, 2011)(holding that a conviction of ABPO under
Massachusetts law falls with the second clause of the ACCA (nown
as the “residual” clause, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)) and
distinguishing United States v. Holloway, 630 F.3d 252, (1st Cir.
Jan. 21, 2011) by noting differences between simple assault and
ABPO).

3
 Paragraph 40 of the PSR reveals an Assault and Battery charge in
the Dorchester District Court, Docket No. 0607-cr-0758, for which
Dubois received 18 months probation on August 16, 2006. There
is also an offense of Resisting Arrest arising out of the
Dorchester District Court, Docket No. 0307-CR-7480H, for which

                                 3
     For purposes of this Memorandum and Order, however, this

Court will address Dubose’s claims presuming an ABPO charge as he

alleges.   Nevertheless, for the reasons discussed below, Dubose’s

motion will be DENIED.

                          II.   DISCUSSION

     The authority of a District Court to alter a valid sentence

is limited to authority conferred by federal statute.   United

States v. Zsofska, 121 F.3d 696 (1st Cir. 1997).    There is no

inherent authority to modify a sentence once imposed.   United

States v. Ross, 245 F.3d 577, 586 (6th Cir. 2001); United States

v. Caterino, 29 F. 3d 1390, 1394 (9th Cir. 1994).

     Here, Dubose seeks relief under 18 U.S.C. § 3582; however,

such relief is not available in this case.

     Title 18 U.S.C. § 3582 provides for imposition of a sentence

of imprisonment.   Subsection (a) outlines factors to be

considered in imposing a term of sentence.   Subsection (b)

provides for the effect of finality of judgment, stating that a

judgment of conviction is final and can only be modified as


Dubose received 6 months House of Correction sentence on June 22,
2004. See PSR ¶ 39. Additional predicate offenses are listed in
the PSR in ¶¶ 37 and 38 (for Armed Robbery and other charges
arising out of the Suffolk Superior Court on June 14, 1999,
Docket No. 99cr10481, and Drug Violations Near School/Park and
other charges, arising out of the Dorchester District Court,
Docket No. 0307-CR-7001D, on November 10, 2003). There is an
ABPO charge in ¶ 51 arising out of the Boston Municipal Court,
Docket No. 0601-CR-6543B but the charge was dismissed on March
20, 2007.

                                  4
provided by subsection (c), or by Fed. R. Crim. P. 35 (correcting

clear error or reducing a sentence for substantial assistance),

and 18 U.S.C. § 3742 (regarding appeal of a sentence).

      Under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(presumably the section Dubose

seeks to invoke) a court “may not modify a term of imprisonment

once it has been imposed, except in three limited circumstances.”

Id.   See United States v. Smartt, 129 F.3d 539, 540-541 (10th

Cir. 1997); United States v. Blackwell, 81 F.3d 945, 947 (10th

Cir. 1996); United States v. Maldonado, 138 F. Supp. 2d 328

(E.D.N.Y. 2001).    First, a court may reduce a sentence of

imprisonment if it finds special circumstances, but only upon

motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons.    18 U.S.C.

§ 3582(c)(1)(A)(i).   Second, a sentence may be modified if

otherwise expressly authorized by statute or by Rule 35 of the

Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.   18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(B).

Third, a modification may be made if the sentencing range has

“subsequently been lowered by the sentencing commission pursuant

to 28 U.S.C. 944(o).”   18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).4

 Specifically, section 3582(c) states “ --The court may not
modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except
that--

(1) in any case —

     (A) the court, upon motion   of the Director of the Bureau of
Prisons, may reduce the term of   imprisonment (and may impose a
term of probation or supervised   release with or without
conditions that does not exceed   the unserved portion of the

                                  5
     This Court has considered the various claims presented by

Dubose, and finds that his arguments do present complex issues

concerning application of the ACCA.   Nevertheless, the Court does

not find that Dubose’s invocation of 18 U.S.C. § 3582 provides a

basis for review of his final judgment because none of Dubose’s



original term of imprisonment), after considering the factors set
forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable,
if it finds that–

          (i) extraordinary and compelling reasons warrant such a
reduction; or

          (ii) the defendant is at least 70 years of age, has
served at least 30 years in prison, pursuant to a sentence
imposed under section 3559(c), for the offense or offenses for
which the defendant is currently imprisoned, and a determination
has been made by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons that the
defendant is not a danger to the safety of any other person or
the community, as provided under section 3142(g); and that such a
reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued
by the Sentencing Commission; and

     (B) the court may modify an imposed term of imprisonment to
the extent otherwise expressly permitted by statute or by Rule 35
of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; and

(2) in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term
of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently
been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the
Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the
term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in
section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a
reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued
by the Sentencing Commission.

18 U.S.C. § 3582(c).



                                6
arguments fall within the three narrow exceptions outlined in the

statute.

                       III.   CONCLUSION

     Based on the foregoing, Dubose’s “Affidavit to Vacate

A.C.C.A. Enhancement” (Docket No. 60), treated as a motion to

modify the judgment of conviction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582,

is DENIED.



SO ORDERED.
