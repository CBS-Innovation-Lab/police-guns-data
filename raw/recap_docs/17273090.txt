I     COURT FINDINGS ON PRESENTENCE INVESTIGATION REPORT

      A   ✔
          G       The court adopts the presentence investigation report without change.

      B   G       The court adopts the presentence investigation report with the following changes.
                  (Check all that apply and specify court determination, findings, or comments, referencing paragraph numbers in the presentence report, if applicable.)
                  (Use Section VIII if necessary.)

          1       G    Chapter Two of the U.S.S.G. Manual determinations by court (including changes to base offense level, or
                       specific offense characteristics):



          2       G    Chapter Three of the U.S.S.G. Manual determinations by court (including changes to victim-related adjustments,
                       role in the offense, obstruction of justice, multiple counts, or acceptance of responsibility):



          3       G    Chapter Four of the U.S.S.G. Manual determinations by court (including changes to criminal history category or
                       scores, career offender, or criminal livelihood determinations):



          4       G    Additional Comments or Findings (including comments or factual findings concerning certain information in the
                       presentence report that the Federal Bureau of Prisons may rely on when it makes inmate classification, designation,
                       or programming decisions):



      C   G       The record establishes no need for a presentence investigation report pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.

II    COURT FINDING ON MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE (Check all that apply.)

      A   ✔
          G       No count of conviction carries a mandatory minimum sentence.

      B   G       Mandatory minimum sentence imposed.

      C   G       One or more counts of conviction alleged in the indictment carry a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment, but the
                  sentence imposed is below a mandatory minimum term because the court has determined that the mandatory minimum
                  does not apply based on

                  G    findings of fact in this case
                  G    substantial assistance (18 U.S.C. § 3553(e))
                  G    the statutory safety valve (18 U.S.C. § 3553(f))

      C      Reason(s) for Sentence Outside the Advisory Guideline System (Check all that apply.)

             G   the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1)
             G   to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense (18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A))
             G   to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct (18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(B))
             G   to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant (18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(C))
             G   to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner
                 (18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(D))
             G   to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants (18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6))
             G   to provide restitution to any victims of the offense (18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(7))


      D      Explain the facts justifying a sentence outside the advisory guideline system. (UseSection VIII if necessary.)

             Essentially, the defendant has demonstrated extraordinary acceptance of responsibility. He has impressed the government
             so much that it is using him in an anti-gang video being made by the Marshals Service and wants to use him to speak to
             at-risk youth. The court was persuaded that the sentence agreed-upon in the binding plea agreement was reasonable in view
             of the section 3553 factors and departed from the Guideline range for justifiable reasons, which were more fully described
             in court.

 VII COURT DETERMINATIONS OF RESTITUTION

       A     ✔
             G      Restitution Not Applicable.

       B      Total Amount of Restitution:

       C      Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

              1     G    For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
                         identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

              2     G    For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
                         issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
                         that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(B).

              3     G    For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
                         ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh
                         the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(1)(B)(ii).

              4     G    Restitution is not ordered for other reasons. (Explain.)




       D      G     Partial restitution is ordered for these reasons (18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)):
