                  RECOMMENDED DECISION ON MOTION FOR RELEASE

         In this action, Petitioner James Raymond Walker seeks relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.

(Amended Section 2255 Motion, ECF No. 92.) Through his section 2255 motion, Petitioner argues

that he is entitled to relief based on Johnson v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015). The matter

is before the Court on Petitioner’s Motion for Release. (ECF No. 91.) 1

                                                          Discussion

         “Release should be granted to an offender pending collateral review only when the

petitioner has raised substantial constitutional claims upon which he has a high probability of

success, and also when extraordinary or exceptional circumstances exist which make the grant of

bail necessary to make the habeas remedy effective.” United States v. Vogel, 595 F. App’x 416,

416-17 (5th Cir. 2015) (per curiam) (unpublished) (quotation marks omitted).

         In Johnson v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015), the Supreme Court held that the so-

called “residual clause” of the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. §



1
 Petitioner filed his request for release pro se. After Petitioner filed the motion for release, the Court granted his
motion to appoint counsel, and appointed counsel to represent Petitioner. (Order, ECF No. 94.)
Case 1:99-cr-00048-DBH Document 97 Filed 11/13/15 Page 2 of 3                                       PageID #: 233



924(e)(2)(B), was unconstitutionally vague. 135 S. Ct. at 2555. “Under the [ACCA], a defendant

convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm faces more severe punishment if he has three

or more previous convictions for a ‘violent felony,’ a term defined to include any felony that

‘involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.’” Id. (quoting

§ 924(e)(2)(B)).2 The phrase “or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk

of physical injury to another” is known as the residual clause. Id. at 2555-56. Given the Johnson

decision, a prisoner who is serving a sentence that was enhanced based in part on the residual

clause of the ACCA might be entitled to habeas relief.

           Significantly, the Supreme Court did not find a constitutional deficiency with the provision

of the ACCA that defines a violent felony as any felony that “has as an element the use, attempted

use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.” Id. at 2563

(“Today’s decision does not call into question application of the [ACCA] to the four enumerated

offenses, or the remainder of the [ACCA’s] definition of a violent felony.”); United States v.

Whindleton, 797 F.3d 105, 112 (1st Cir. 2015) (noting, on direct appeal, that the defendant did not

challenge the constitutionality of the force clause after Johnson); United States v. Bernardini, ---

F. App’x ---, 2015 WL 6143866, 2015 U.S. App. Lexis 18383 (6th Cir. Oct. 20, 2015) (per curiam)

(unpublished) (holding that “Johnson left the ACCA’s use-of-force clause undisturbed, and

Bernardini’s robbery conviction is still a violent felony under the ACCA’s use-of-force clause”).


2
    Title 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B) states in pertinent part:

           the term “violent felony” means any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one
           year, . . . that—

           (i)      has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the
           person of another; or

           (ii)     is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct
           that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.


                                                               2

       A review of the record in this case suggests that the enhancement of Petitioner’s sentence

under the ACCA was based on three prior robbery convictions. The application of the Johnson

decision to Petitioner’s case thus is not readily apparent.         Petitioner, therefore, has not

demonstrated at this stage of the proceedings a high probability of success on his habeas claim. In

addition, Petitioner has not presented any facts or argument that would constitute the “exceptional

circumstances” necessary to justify his release on bail pending the Court’s decision on his section

2255 motion.

                                          CONCLUSION

       Based on the foregoing analysis, I recommend that the Court deny Petitioner’s motion for

release (ECF No. 91) without prejudice to Petitioner’s ability to reassert his request for release

should Petitioner conclude that he can establish a high probability of success on his claim or other

facts that would constitute exceptional circumstances.
