A m Restitut.`ion Not Applieable.

B Total Arnount of Restitution:

 

C Restitution not ordered (Cheek only one.):

l l:l For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under lt§ U.S.C`. § 3663/\, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 ls`.S.C. § ftoti$A(cl(J)(A).

2 l:l For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory nnder 18 U.S`C. § 3663,“\` restitution is not ordered becaus: determining complex

issues ol` fact and relating them to the cause or amount ofthe vietims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would he outweighed hy the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C. §3663A(e)(3)(l3).

3 |:l llor other offenses |`or which restitution is authorized under tit U.S.(`. § 3663 andfor required by the sentencing guidelines restitution is not

ordered because the complication and prolongation ofthe sentencing process resulting from the fashioning ofa restitution order outweigh
the need to provide restitution to any victims under 13 U.S.C`. § 3663(a){l)(H](ii).

4 l:l Rcstitution is not ordered for other reasons (Explarn.)
