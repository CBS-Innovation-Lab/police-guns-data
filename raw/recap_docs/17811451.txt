            'it   to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to providej ust punishment for the offense (18 U S,c. § 3553(a)(2)(A))

            rt    to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct (18 U.s.c. § 3553(a)(2)(I3))

            rt    to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant ( 18 U.s. C. § 3553(a)(2)(C))

             In this case, where the defendant's withdrawal from the home invasion consp iracy reflects a recognition , albeit
             last minute, that he should not proceed with criminal activity, a sentence somewhat outside the quideline range
             is sufficient but not more greater than necessary to serve the purposes of § 3553 .

                 o	 For offenses for which restit ution is otherwise mand atory under 18 US c. § 3663 A, restitution is not ordered beca use the num ber of
                       ident ifiable victims is so large as to make restit ution impracticable under J 8 U.S.c. § 3663 A(c)( 3)(A).

           2     o	 For offenses for which restituti on is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.c. § 3663A , rest itut ion is not ordered because determinin g comple x
                       issues of fact and relating them to the ca use or amou nt of the vict ims' losses would comp lica te or prolong the sentencin g process to a degree
                       that the need to provide restitutio n to any victi m would be outwe ighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 Us.c. § 3663 A(c)(3)( B)
