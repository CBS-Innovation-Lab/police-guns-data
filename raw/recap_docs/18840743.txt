                      UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                   FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 07-cr-173-PB

Corey J. Clark



                                  O R D E R

     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

November 6, 2007 trial in the above case, citing the need for

additional time to complete discovery and prepare for trial.            The

government does not object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reason and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from November 6, 2007 to January 8, 2008.            In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
