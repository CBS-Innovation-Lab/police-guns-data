STATEMENT OF REASONS

VII COURT DETERM|NAT[ONS OF RESTITUTION
A m Restitution Not Applicable.

B Total Arnount of Restitution:
C Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

1 ij For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c}(3](A).

2 l___i For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663.»\, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S,C. § 3663A(c)(3)(B),
3 [:] For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under IB U.S.C. § 3663 andfor required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh

the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(l)(B)(ii).

4 [:l Restitution is not ordered for other reasons (Explain.)

D l:i Partial restitution is ordered for these reasons (18 U.S.C. § 3553(e)):

VlII ADDlTIONAL FACTS JUSTIFYING THE SENTENCE lN THIS CASE (If applicable.)
Court departed from CHC III to CHC l finding that Category III significantly overstated the seriousness of the defendants Criminal

History. Court further adjusted sentence downward based on mitigating circumstances, specifically the defendants youth, disadvantaged
upbringing, and his efforts at drug treatment per 18 U.S.C. 3553(a)(1).

Sections I, II, III, IV, and VII of the Statement of Reasons form must be completed in all felony cases.
