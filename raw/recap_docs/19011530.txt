                UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                      DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

           v.                           Criminal No. 12-cr-80-01-JL

Leigh Alden Baker

                                O R D E R


     The assented to motion to reschedule jury trial (document no.

8) filed by defendant is granted.           The court is not generally

inclined to find that a prosecutor's vacation plans, however

well-deserved the vacation may be, should be considered in trial

scheduling. The court interprets the motion as asserting the

defendant's position that the interests of justice will be best

served by the currently assigned prosecutor's continued involvement

in the case, and so finds and orders accordingly.          Final Pretrial

is rescheduled to November 26, 2012 at 2:30 p.m.; Trial is continued

to the two-week period beginning December 4, 2012, 9:30 a.m. In

addition to various filing deadlines contained in the local rules,

the parties shall also file any in limine motions no later than ten

(10) days prior to the final pretrial conference.           Objections to

motions in limine shall be filed no later than three (3) days prior

to the final pretrial conference.

     Defendant shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights within 10

days.   The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting

a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ' 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv), for the

reasons set forth in the motion.

      SO ORDERED.
