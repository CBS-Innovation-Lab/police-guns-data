            UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                    DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America,
     Plaintiff

          v.
                                     Case No.12-cr-167-01/02/03-SM

Thomas J. Dunn, Quentin Simon,
and Willie Ortiz,
     Defendants

                      A M E N D E D      O R D E R

     The Court has learned that Attorney Jonathan Saxe will not

be available for trial during the week of September 4 , 2013, due

to sequestration and furlough constraints placed upon the

Federal Public Defenders. The Court amends its order entered on

June 7 , 2013 as follows:

     Defendant Ortiz’s Assented-to Motion to Continue the final

pretrial conference and trial (document n o . 24) is granted in

part and denied in part. Trial has been rescheduled for the

month of August 2013. Defendant Ortiz shall file a waiver of

speedy trial rights on or before June 1 7 , 2013.

     The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting

a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendants in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h((7)(A)and(B),

in that failure to grant a continuance would unreasonably deny

the defendants the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence

at 1:30 p.m.

       Jury selection will take place on August 2 0 , 2013 at 9:30
