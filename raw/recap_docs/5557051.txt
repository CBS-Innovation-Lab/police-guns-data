                 Guidelines: TOL 30, CH VI, 180 - 210 months custody, 36 - 60 months supervised release, $15,000 -

                 binding plea agreement of 190 months custody and 60 months supervised release. Defense counsel argues
                 as to why the court should accept the binding plea and sentence. Defendant addresses the court. Formal
                 sentencing: 190 months custody, 5 years supervised release on the standard conditions plus the additional
                 conditions outlined in court. Court does not impose a fine but does impose the mandatory $100 special
                 assessment fee. Defendant advised of his rights.
