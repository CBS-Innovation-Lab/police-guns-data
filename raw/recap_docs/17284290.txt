B Total Amount of Restitution:
C Restiti.ttion not ordered (Check only one.):

l l:l Foi' offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S C § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under l8 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

2 [:l For offenses t`or which restitution is otherwise mandatory under lB U.S,C` § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
issues effect and relating them to the cause or amount ofthe vtctims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under lB U S C § 3663A(c)(3)(B)
3 [:I For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U S C. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines restitution is not
ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning ofa restitution order outweigh

the need to provide restitution to any victims under 13 U S C_ § 3663(a)(l )(B)(ii).
