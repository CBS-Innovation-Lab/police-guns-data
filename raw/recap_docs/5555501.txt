          ASSENTED-TO MOTION TO CONTINUE STATUS CONFERENCE

      The government hereby requests a continuance of the status

conference, currently scheduled for February 12, 2008.               As

grounds, the government states that the parties have been

negotiating a universal plea agreement.           The proposed universal

plea agreement, which would resolve the case against all

defendants in the case, is being considered by the U.S.

Attorney’s Office and a decision is expected in the next three

weeks.

      Accordingly, the government, with the assent of all

defendants, requests a continuance of the status conference to a

date on or after March 11, 2008.

      In addition, the parties agree to exclude the time from

February 12, 2008, to the date set for a further status

conference, and ask that this Court find, based on the above,

that the ends of justice served by granting the requested

exclusions outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendants in a speedy trial, and, accordingly, exclude the above

period in computing the time within which trial must commence
