                         UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                              DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

              v.                                         Case No. 07-cr-150-01-SM

William Swanson


                                              ORDER



        Defendant's assented-to motion to continue the trial (document no. 9) is granted. Trial has been

rescheduled for the October 2007 trial period. Defendant shall file a Waiver of Speedy Trial Rights not

later than September 7, 2007. On the filing of such waiver, his continuance shall be effective.

        The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance outweigh the best

interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure

to grant a continuance would unreasonably deny the defendant the reasonable time necessary for

effective preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the circumstances.
