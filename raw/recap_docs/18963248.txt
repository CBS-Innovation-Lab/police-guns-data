                                  O R D E R


        The assented to motion to reschedule jury trial (document no.

9) filed by defendant is granted; Final Pretrial is rescheduled to

March 14, 2011, 11:00 AM; Trial is continued to the two-week period

beginning March 22, 2011, 9:30 AM.

        The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a

continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv), for the

reasons set forth in the motion.

        SO ORDERED.
