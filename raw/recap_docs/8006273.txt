MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF .
PETITIONER’S MOTION UNDER 28 USC § 2255 `

COMES NOW, The Petitioner, ghevere G_t, d pro se, and respectfully moves this Court to
file a “Protectiye Motion to Vacate, Set Aside or Correct His Sentence” pursuant to 28 USC § 22-55.
Rather than'seeking la ruling on the motion at this tirne, the .Petitioner requests that this Court hold the
P_etitioner’s Motion in abeyance pending the Supreme Court or this Circuit Ccurt’s resolution of When
a new rule of constitutional law has heen- i‘made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the
Suprenie Court?’. In support thereof, he states :- l

Title 28 of the United States Code subsections 2255 proyides, pursuant to the Anti-Terrorisrn
and Effective Death Penalty Act [AEDPA] that a motion under Section 2255 may be brought Within ‘
one year &cm; “(3) the date on Which the_right asserted Was initially recognized by the _Suprerne Court,
if that right has been newly recognized by the Suprerne Coult` and made retroactively applicable to

cases on collateral review”. 28 USC § 2255.

Case 3:97-cr-00271-GAG Document 1130 . Filed 01/23/2006 _ Page 2 613

In the instant case no Section 2255 motion has been previously rated on the merits.' This,
however, does not'preclude relief in this case. This motion is based on the new announcement of the
United States Su`preme Court in Um'ted Srates v. Booker, 543 US __, 125 S-.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d
621 (2'005).'

Thus, Section 2255(3) merely requires that Petitioner’s motion be made Witbin one-year of the
Booker decision SeeDodd v. Um`ted Sz.‘afes, __ US ____, 125 S.Ct. 2478, 162 L.Ed.2d 343 (2005).
What is unclear is 'Whether` the new rule of constitutional law first announced in Apprendz` v. New
Jersey,'$?>{) USV 466 '{2009), secondly clarified in Blcz_,"tely v. Washingz‘crzy 542 US 296 (2(}04); and
subsequently applied to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines in Untted Stares v. Booker, 543 US _,
125 S.Ct. 738, 160'L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), has been “made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the
Supreme Court”. l

l With respect to the requirement of retroactivity, the Petitioner is aware that the question of
When the new rule of constitutional law announced by Booker has been “made retroactively applicable
to cases on collateral review”`is` currently before the Supreme Court: See Clark v. U.S., S.Ct. Case
Nurnber 05-5491. l n

Therefore, to take advantage of this new right, the Petitioner must tile his § 2255 petition
Within one-year of it’s announcement according to Doo’d, supra. l\lot filing Within a year of its
announcement Would bar the Petitioner from seeking relief based on Booker, should it be held to be
retroactive in the future Petitioner’s § 2255 motion Will_ have`been timely tiled, because it Was placed
in the prison mail system for delivery to this Court on or'before Ja.nuary 1_2,' 20(16. (Bo'oker Was decided
January12, 2005). See Dodd`v. Uaitea' States, __ US __, 125 S.Ct. 2478, 162 L.Ed.2d- 343 (2005).

7 Once the Supreme Court, _or the this Circuit decides the question ot" retroactivity, the Petitioner
Wiil tile a supplemental memorandum of law in support ot` his motion to vacate, set aside or correct his
sentence pursuant to 28 USC § 22'55. Until then, the Petitioner respectfully asks this Honorable Court

to_ hold his motion in abeyance

CONCLUSION
Wherefore, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Honorable Court holds his motion in
abeyance pending a decision from the Suprerne Court on the retroactivity issue, cr consider the

constitutional violation recognized in Booker to have been properly preserved for any future litigation
