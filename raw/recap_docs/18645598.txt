                     IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                       FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO


 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

       Plaintiff
                                                     Criminal No. 08-163 (ADC)
       v.

 [7] ANTONIO DE JESUS-VELAZQUEZ,

       Defendant.

              ORDER ADOPTING REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION

      On August 14, 2008, defendant Antonio de Jesús-Velázquez filed a Motion to Suppress

audiotape N-26. Defendant challenges its admissibility asserting the same was not audible.

(Docket No. 181).

      The government opposed defendant’s motion (Docket No. 183). A hearing was held

before Magistrate-Judge Marcos E. López who subsequently issued a Report and

Recommendation. It was recommended that:

      (a)    the government was to amend and correct the transcripts at pages 5 and 14.

      All other portions of the recording were deemed audible and the transcript legible.

(Docket No. 184).

      No objections were filed. Since the Magistrate-Judge’s Report and Recommendation

remains unopposed, the recommendations therein are ADOPTED.
