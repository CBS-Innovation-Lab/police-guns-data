               MOTION TO MODIFY CONDITIONS OF RELEASE
                              (ASSENTED TO)

       Now comes the defendant, and moves this Honorable Court to modify the

conditions of the defendantâ€™s pretrial release. Specifically, the defendant seeks that his

travel restrictions be modified so as to allow him to travel within New England,

specifically Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont. In

support of this motion the defendant states that he has been on pretrial release for three

years, and has consistently abided by all conditions of release. Mr. Levesque and his

wife wish to travel occasionally within New England to visit with family or friends, or to

take a short vacation. Undersigned counsel has conferred with counsel for the

government and has been informed the government assents to this Motion.
