     RECOMMENDED DECISION ON MOTION TO MODIFY SENTENCE

      In this action, Defendant Trevis Caldwell moves to modify his sentence.

(Motion, ECF No. 71.) Defendant is serving a 223-month sentence on a conviction that

followed his guilty plea to a number of federal offenses, including armed bank robbery.

United States v. Caldwell, 358 F.3d 138, 139 (1st Cir. 2004). He contends the Court

incorrectly sentenced him under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(B)(i) after another charge, which

alleged possession of a short-barreled shotgun, was dismissed on the Government’s

motion. (Motion at 2-3.) Defendant contends that the other charge was dismissed because

the weapon did not qualify as short-barreled. (Id.; Response, ECF No. 74 at 2.) The

Government objects to the motion. (Response at 1.)

      Following a review of Defendant’s motion and the Government’s request for

dismissal, I recommend the Court grant the Government’s request, and dismiss

Defendant’s motion.
                                             I.       DISCUSSION

          Title 18 U.S.C. § 3582, which governs sentence modifications, provides that a

criminal judgment is final, with limited exceptions.1 Section 3582(b) sets forth three


1
    Title 3582 provides in part:

           (b) Effect of finality of judgment.--Notwithstanding the fact that a sentence to
          imprisonment can subsequently be—

                   (1) modified pursuant to the provisions of subsection (c);

                   (2) corrected pursuant to the provisions of rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal
                       Procedure and section 3742; or

                   (3) appealed and modified, if outside the guideline range, pursuant to the
                       provisions of section 3742;

          a judgment of conviction that includes such a sentence constitutes a final judgment for all
          other purposes.

          (c) Modification of an imposed term of imprisonment.--The court may not modify a
          term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except that—

                   (1) in any case—

                           (A)       the court, upon motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons,
                           may reduce the term of imprisonment (and may impose a term of probation
                           or supervised release with or without conditions that does not exceed the
                           unserved portion of the original term of imprisonment), after considering
                           the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable,
                           if it finds that—

                                   (i)     extraordinary and compelling reasons warrant such a
                                   reduction; or

                                   (ii)     the defendant is at least 70 years of age, has served at least
                                   30 years in prison, pursuant to a sentence imposed under section
                                   3559(c), for the offense or offenses for which the defendant is
                                   currently imprisoned, and a determination has been made by the
                                   Director of the Bureau of Prisons that the defendant is not a danger
                                   to the safety of any other person or the community, as provided
                                   under section 3142(g);

                                   and that such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy
                                   statements issued by the Sentencing Commission; and


                                                         2
circumstances    under     which     a   court    can    modify      a   sentence.     First,     under

subsection 3582(b)(1), a sentence may be modified pursuant to subsection (c), which

provides that the Director of the Bureau of Prisons may file a motion to reduce the prison

term under certain specified circumstances (subsection 3582(c)(1)), and that a sentence

may be modified when the Sentencing Commission has lowered a sentencing range and

other requirements are satisfied (subsection 3582(c)(2)). Neither situation applies to

Defendant’s motion.

       In addition, subsection 3582(b)(2), which applies to sentence corrections pursuant

to Fed. R. Crim. P. 35 (i.e., corrections within 14 days after sentencing and reductions for

substantial assistance on the Government’s motion) and to direct appeals from a sentence

pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3742, and subsection 3582(b)(3), which also applies to direct

appeals pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3742, also do not apply to Defendant’s motion. Plaintiff’s

sentence, therefore, cannot be modified pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582.

       Finally, although Defendant did not cite 28 U.S.C. § 2255 as a basis for his motion,

this Court would lack jurisdiction over the matter had he filed a section 2255 motion. This

Court dismissed as untimely under section 2255(f) a prior motion filed by Defendant.


                      (B)     the court may modify an imposed term of imprisonment to the
                      extent otherwise expressly permitted by statute or by Rule 35 of the
                      Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; and

              (2) in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment
              based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing
              Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the
              Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the
              term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a)
              to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with
              applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.


                                                 3
Caldwell v. United States, Nos. 2:09-cv-438-DBH, 2:02-cr-00041-DBH (D. Me. Oct. 16,

2009). The dismissal of Defendant’s “first habeas petition as time-barred was a decision

on the merits, and any later habeas petition challenging the same conviction is second or

successive and is subject to [28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)].” In re Rains, 659 F.3d 1274, 1275

(10th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (denying authorization to file a second or successive

28 U.S.C. § 2254 petition); Villanueva v. United States, 346 F.3d 55, 58 (2d Cir. 2003)

(holding “that a first § 2255 petition that has properly been dismissed as time-barred under

[28 U.S.C. § 2244] has been adjudicated on the merits, such that authorization from this

court is required before filing a second or successive § 2255 petition”).

       This Court lacks jurisdiction to consider a second or successive section 2255 motion

unless the First Circuit Court of Appeals has specifically authorized the Court to consider

the motion. Title 28 U.S.C. § 2244 applies to second or successive section 2255 motions,

pursuant to section 2255(h). Section 2244(b)(3)(A) states: “Before a second or successive

application permitted by this section is filed in the district court, the applicant shall move

in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the

application.” See also First Circuit Rule 22.1. The First Circuit has held: “We have

interpreted [section 2255(h) ] as ‘stripping the district court of jurisdiction over a second

or successive habeas petition unless and until the court of appeals has decreed that it may

go forward.’” Trenkler v. United States, 536 F.3d 85, 96 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Pratt v.

United States, 129 F.3d 54, 57 (1st Cir. 1997)). A review of the record reveals no evidence

to suggest that Defendant has obtained from the First Circuit permission to file the pending



                                              4
motion. See 28 U.S.C. §§ 2244, 2255. To the extent the motion could be construed as a

section 2255 motion, therefore, this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider the motion.

                                    II.    CONCLUSION

       Based on the foregoing analysis, I recommend the Court deny Defendant’s motion

to modify the sentence. To the extent the motion could be construed as a section 2255

motion, I further recommend that the Court deny a certificate of appealability pursuant to

Rule 11 of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Cases because there is no substantial showing

of the denial of a constitutional right within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).

                                          NOTICE

              A party may file objections to those specified portions of a magistrate
       judge’s report or proposed findings or recommended decisions entered
       pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 636(b)(1)(B) for which de novo review by the district
       court is sought, together with a supporting memorandum, within fourteen
       (14) days of being served with a copy thereof. A responsive memorandum
       shall be filed within fourteen (14) days after the filing of the objection.

              Failure to file a timely objection shall constitute a waiver of the right
       to de novo review by the district court and to appeal the district court's order.
