                             UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                              DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

         v.                                                 Crim. No. 06-cr-134-01-SM

                                           ORDER


       The defendant requests the appointment of counsel for the purpose of filing a motion to

reduce his sentence based upon a pending amendment to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines

regarding crack cocaine offenses (doc. no. 60). For the following reasons, the defendant's

motion is denied at this time.

       On June 30, 2011, the United States Sentencing Commission determined to give

retroactive effect to the permanent guideline amendment regarding crack cocaine offenses (Parts

A and C of Amendment 750). This amendment implemented the emergency directives in section

8 of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. Absent congressional action to the contrary, retroactivity

of the guideline amendment becomes effective November 1, 2011, at which time reductions in

sentences pursuant to 18 U.S.C. ยง 3582(c)(2) based on the retroactive application of the crack

cocaine amendment will be authorized. It is yet to be determined, however, whether Congress

will take action on the proposed guideline amendment.

       The court is in the process of identifying persons sentenced in this district who would be

potentially eligible to seek a reduced sentence under this amendment should it ultimately

becomes law. Should this defendant's sentence be identified as potentially eligible for reduction

under the proposed guideline amendment, he will be notified and the court will appoint counsel

to pursue a sentence reduction on his behalf. Additionally, because it appears that the defendant's

earliest possible release date under the proposed amendment is the late summer of 2012, it is not

necessary to give expedited treatment to his request for counsel.

       Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, the defendant's motion for the appointment of

counsel (doc. no. 60) is DENIED without prejudice at this time.

       So ordered.
