        GOVERNMENT'S MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF ITS MOTION
             FOR UPWARD DEPARTURE AND SENTENCING MEMORANDUM


I.      INTRODUCTION

        On June 2, 2006 the defendant, Vanhhatdy Souvanaxab, and his

co-defendant Bobby Soundara, pled guilty to a two count

indictment charging them with knowing possession of an

unregistered pipe bomb in violation of 26 U.S.C. §§ 5841, 5861(d)

and 5871 (Count I) and with damaging and destroying by fire a

building which also resulted in personal injury, in violation of

18 U.S.C. § 844(i)(Count II).

        This memorandum is in support of a motion for upward

departure based primarily on the victim’s injuries and is a

response to the defendant’s sentencing memorandum.1                It is also

notice of the government’s intention to present a witness or

witnesses at the sentencing hearing to establish the nature and

extent of the defendant’s gang affiliations and rivalries.


        1
      Two other grounds may exist for an upward departure though
the government is pressing neither. See USSG § 5K2.3 (Extreme
Psychological Injury ) and § 5K2.5 (Property Damage or Loss). The
Court may wish to revisit the Psychological Injury provision
after the victim presents her allocution at sentencing.

II.   FACTS

      On September 11, 2005, at approximately 2:00 a.m., several

members of the Laos Pride street gang, traveling in three cars,

went to the home of Samang Tep located at 1 West Harry Street,

Cranston, RI.     Tep was a member of the rival Young Bloods street

gang.    Among the Laos Pride members present in the caravan were

defendant, Vanhhatdy Souvanaxab and co-defendant Bobby Soundara.

      When the Laos Pride gang arrived at the West Harry Street

home co-defendant Bobby Soundara took a homemade pipe bomb, lit

the fuse, and threw the bomb through the first floor window.               At

the time, Souvanaxab knew that it was the home of a rival Young

Blood.    Tep was not home, however.        In the house were Tep’s

mother and Mrs. Tep’s grandchild.      Awakened by the sound of

breaking glass, Mrs. Tep approached the flaming pipe bomb just as

the end blew off and caused Mrs. Tep to lose an eye.             She also

suffered several body lacerations.

      Several items were seized from the scene and sent to the ATF

Laboratory for analysis.      These items included : a 6" long piece

of galvanized pipe partially wrapped in white tape with red

lettering “CRAFTED WITH PRIDE IN U.S.A.”; pieces of silicone-like

material; pieces of hardwood floor damaged by the explosion; a

section of wall from the blast area; and wood from the exterior

wall outside the blast area.      In addition, a piece of silicone-

like material removed from Mrs. Tep’s leg was obtained from Rhode

Island Hospital and sent to the ATF Laboratory.
  Case 1:06-cr-00005-ML-DLM   Document 41   Filed 08/29/2006    Page 5 of 12



      The ATF Laboratory determined, in common parlance, that the

seized item was a pipe bomb.       The ATF Laboratory found residue

of a perchlorate explosive mixture (“PEM”) inside the pipe.              PEM

is the powder commonly used in fireworks.        The silicone-like

material was determined to be a hot-melt adhesive.             Fragments of

a green pyrotechnic fuse were embedded in the adhesive.

      On November 16, 2005, defendant Vanhhatdy Souvanaxab was

interviewed by ATF agents.      The interview was video recorded.

Souvanaxab admitted that he is a member of Laos Pride.             See

Interview Transcript, dated November 16, 2005, p. 3.            He also

admitted that Laos Pride and Young Bloods are rivals.            Id. @ p.

28.    He said he heard other members of Laos Pride talking about

pipe bombing a house the night before September 11.             Id. @ p. 13

(“I heard them say they were going to do it, but I didn’t know

which house it was going to be.”) Id. “Q: Who said he was going

to do it?   A: Bobby.” Id.     He admitted that on September 11,

2005, prior to the bombing, he was present at co-defendant

Soundara’s house and saw a pipe bomb being passed around that

Souvanaxab admitted he made.      He admitted to manufacturing four

such bombs.   Id. @ p. 57-8.      He stated that he and Soundara, as

well as others, purchased the fireworks used to make the bomb in

New Hampshire.    Id. @ p. 45.

      Vanhhatdy Souvanaxab said he obtained the galavanized pipe

used to make the four bombs from the trash at his place of

employment and that he stole the hot glue gun and two glue sticks
  Case 1:06-cr-00005-ML-DLM    Document 41   Filed 08/29/2006   Page 6 of 12



from a former employer.       Id. @ p. 62; 56-7.     Souvanaxab said he

made the bombs by using the glue gun to direct glue to one end of

the pipe.     He inserted powder from “Whistling Pete” fireworks

into the pipe from the open end and sealed the pipe by putting

glue into the remaining open end along with a fuse.

            2.   Gang Affiliation

     The defendant is an admitted member of Laos Pride. The

victim in this case is the mother of a member of a rival gang --

the Young Bloods.    The government believes that an overview of

the tension and history of the gangs supports its motion for an

upward departure and underscore its view that a serious sentence

is warranted in this case particularly in light of the statutory

sentencing factors mandating punishment and deterrence.             See 18

U.S.C. §§ 3553(a)(2)(A) and (B).

     Rhode Island is not immune from the burgeoning gang problems

affecting the United States.       While not as severe as some

Districts, it is none the less present and measurable.             There are

some twenty or so active gangs in the District chiefly, though

not exclusively, located in the City of Providence.

     Some of the names are fairly familiar and have international

affiliates, (Latin Kings, MS-13, Bloods, Crips) and others are

named for a single Providence street (Hanover Boyz).            Generally,

gangs engage in a variety of criminal activity including drug

distribution, assaults with deadly weapons, drive by shootings,

and illegal weapon possession.       There is no evidence that Laos
  Case 1:06-cr-00005-ML-DLM    Document 41   Filed 08/29/2006   Page 7 of 12



Pride participated in drug distribution.

       Laos Pride, also known as “LP,” “1216" has over forty

members and associates.       They are a “Crip” based gang which

means, among other things, that they have rivalries with “Blood”

gangs, including the Providence based Young Bloods, also known as

“YB” and “242".



III.     ARGUMENT

            A.      Upward Departure

       The government believes that the Probation Officer has

correctly calculated the applicable advisory guideline level in

this case.    The defendant has a total offense level of 21 and a

Criminal History Category of I.        The guideline range is 37-46

months.     Count II carries a statutory mandatory minimum sentence

of 84 months (7 years).

       For all of the following reasons, the government believes an

upward departure is warranted.

            1.      The Significant Personal Injuries In this
                    Case Warrant An Upward Departure

       An upward departure is warranted where significant personal

injuries result from the offense.

          If significant physical injury resulted, the court
          may increase the sentence above the authorized
          guideline range.     The extent of the increase
          ordinarily should depend on the extent of the
          injury, the degree to which it may prove permanent,
          and the extend to which the injury was intended or
          knowingly risked. When the victim suffers a major,
          permanent disability and when such injury was
          intentionally inflicted, a substantial departure
  Case 1:06-cr-00005-ML-DLM   Document 41   Filed 08/29/2006    Page 8 of 12



         may be appropriate. If the injury is less serious
         or if the defendant (though criminally negligent)
         did not knowingly create the risk of harm, a less
         substantial departure would be indicated.      In
         general, the same considerations apply as in
         §5K2.1.


USSG § 5K2.2.

       The Section 5K2.1 factors referenced in the preceding

guideline refer to upward departures where death results from the

offense conduct.    These factors are: 1) the dangerousness of the

defendant’s conduct; 2) the extent to which death or serious

injury was intended or knowingly risked; and 3) the extent to

which the offense level for the offense of conviction already

reflects the risk of personal injury.       See USSG § 5K2.1 Death

(Policy Statement).

       In assessing these factors, it is clear the victim in this

case suffered a major permanent disability.         It is also

undisputable that the conduct in this case was gang motivated and

intentional.    The defendant’s conduct was obviously dangerous.

There is a knowing risk of death or serious injury when one

simply possesses a pipe bomb, never mind where the pipe bomb is

lit and thrown into (at) a residence at 2:00 a.m.              The defendant

admits making (4) pipe bombs and only two have been accounted

for.    The only factor appearing to weigh in the defendant’s favor

is the extent to which personal injury is already taken into

account in his guideline calculations.       Here the guidelines

assigned a four level increase because the possession of the pipe
  Case 1:06-cr-00005-ML-DLM   Document 41   Filed 08/29/2006   Page 9 of 12



bomb was used in connection with another felony offense i.e.,

damaging a building by means of an explosive which resulted in

personal injury.    See PSR @ ¶ 16.    This is misleading, however,

because these same four levels would have been added if no

personal injury had resulted because damaging a building by means

of an explosive is “in connection with another felony offense”

which is the thing required by the § 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement.

Thus all of the guideline factors for an upward departure are

present to a substantial degree.      Even conceding arguendo that

the defendants didn’t mean to harm anyone -- the act was so

reckless and the injuries so severe, that a significant upward

departure is warranted.2      The defendant knew the night before,

according to his own admissions, that Laos Pride was going to

bomb someone’s house.     Interview Transcript, @ p.13.        He had

plenty of time to withdraw from the attack but he chose to

participate anyway.    This was not some prank.       This was not done

so the gang could hear the bang of the explosion.          They went to

the Young Bloods’ house in three cars to inflict harm.

     The real question in this case is how much of an upward

departure is appropriate.      The government is aware of the

advisory nature of the guidelines and the touchstone requirement



     2
       The issue of whether the defendants had the specific
intent to hurt someone (as opposed to the intent to throw a pipe
bomb) is a close call. Indeed, but for its closeness, the
government would be arguing that the appropriate guideline
section to apply is Attempted Murder pursuant to USSG § 2A2.1
where the base offense level would be 33.
 Case 1:06-cr-00005-ML-DLM   Document 41   Filed 08/29/2006    Page 10 of 12



that a sentence be “reasonable.”      Defining what is reasonable of

course has proved linguistically challenging.         Cf.     United States

v. Jimenez-Beltre 440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir. 2006)

(reasonableness assumed where there is “ ... a plausible

explanation and a defensible overall result.” )           In this case

the government believes the guideline for aggravated assault is

helpful.    An aggravated assault carries a seven level enhancement

where there is permanent bodily injury and five levels where

there is serious bodily injury.      See USSG §§

2A2.2(b)(3)(B)and(C).    The total offense level here is 21 (37-

46).    The restricted guideline sentence is 84 months (7 years).

The government believes an upward departure to 96 months (8

years), or one year more than the mandatory minimum, is

reasonable and just.

       The government is making this recommendation, two years less

than the co-defendant, for several reasons.        First, the defendant

has been steadily employed.     His employer gave him a good

evaluation and said he would still employ him if he could.             The

next reason is the defendant has no criminal history points and

is a very young man.    Third, the defendant’s personal history as

chronicled in the PSR is gut wrenching.       Fourth, though a member

of Laos Pride, the defendant does not display the same level of

apparent defiance as his co-defendant.       And lastly, the defendant

is subject to deportation following his incarceration.

       For all these reasons, the United States believes a sentence
 Case 1:06-cr-00005-ML-DLM   Document 41    Filed 08/29/2006   Page 11 of 12



of 8 years, while stern, is fair and just.


          B.     GOVERNMENT’S RESPONSE TO THE DEFENDANT’S
                 OBJECTIONS IN HIS SENTENCING MEMORANDUM


     The defendant raised objections in his sentencing

memorandum.    The government responds as follows.

          1.      Gang Membership

     The defendant does not dispute that he is a member of Laos

Pride. He does seem to argue that Laos Pride is not a traditional

street gang but rather they just hang out with each other and

drink beer.    The United States disputes this and will present

evidence at sentencing.      The defendant’s remaining arguments are

essentially subsumed by the government’s sentencing

recommendation.
