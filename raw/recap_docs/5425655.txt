                                  )

                ASSENTED TO MOTION FOR A CONTINUANCE

     The United States of America, by and through the undersigned

attorneys, hereby moves for a continuance of the pre-trial

conference scheduled for January 10, 2007, to January 22, 2007,

the date set for the trial of this matter.

     In support of its motion, the government states that the

government has provided a proposed plea agreement to defendant

consistent with terms agreeable to the defendant.              Counsel for

defendant needs additional time to consult with defendant before

the agreement is finalized.     Due to defendantâ€™s current medical

condition and hospitalization outside the district, defense

counsel requires additional time to travel to consult with

defendant.    The defendant assents to a continuance of the pre-

trial conference for the reasons set forth above.

                                          Respectfully submitted,

                                          MICHAEL J. SULLIVAN
