               UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                     DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE




United States of America

     v.                                      Case No. _06-cr-079-01-PB

Dorothy Collins



                               O R D E R

     Defendant moves to reduce her sentence (document no. 119)

based on a change in the criminal history guideline in the

November 1, 2007 edition of the United States Sentencing

Commission Guidelines Manual.     For the reasons stated below, the

motion to reduce sentence is DENIED.

     On February 7, 2007, the defendant pled guilty to a three

count Superseding Indictment charging her with Interference with

Commerce Threats or Violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §

1951(a); Possession of a Firearm with an Obliterated Serial

Number, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(k); and, Possession of a

Firearm by a Convicted Felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g).

On March 6, 2008, she filed a motion requesting a sentence

reduction based on a change in the criminal history guideline in

the November 1, 2007 edition of the United States Sentencing

Commission Guidelines Manual.

      The changes to the criminal history guidelines were not made

retroactive and are not listed in USSG §1B1.10(c). USSG

§1B1.10(a)(2) notes a reduction in the defendant’s term of

imprisonment is not consistent with this policy statement and,

therefore, is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c) if none of

the amendments listed in (c) are applicable to the defendant.

Therefore, no reduction is warranted in this case.

      Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, Defendant’s motion to

reduce sentence (document no. 119) is DENIED.

      SO ORDERED.
