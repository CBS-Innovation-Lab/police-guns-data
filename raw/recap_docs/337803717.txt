                        IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                          FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO




  UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,                             Criminal No. 22-110 (ADC)
  Plaintiff,


                  v.


  IRVING VIDOT-VEGA,
  Defendant.



                         REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
                    ON RULE 11(c)(1)(B) CHANGE OF PLEA HEARING


        I.     Procedural Background
        On March 17, 2022, Defendant Irving Vidot-Vega was charged by a Grand Jury in a four-count
indictment. Defendant was charged in counts one, two and three. Defendant agrees to plead guilty to
Counts One and Three of the Indictment.
        Count One of the Indictment charges that, on or about March 8, 2022, in the District of Puerto
Rico and within the jurisdiction of this Court, the defendant, Irving Vidot-Vega and co-defendants,
knowingly and intentionally possessed with intent to distribute detectable amounts of a mixture and
substance containing marihuana, a Schedule I controlled substance. All in violation of Title 21, United
States Code, Section 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(D).
        Count Three of the Indictment charges that on or about March 8, 2022, in the District of Puerto

substances pursuant to Title 21 U.S.C. §841(a)(1), in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section
924(c)(1)(A).
          On April 28, 2023, Defendant informed the Court of his intention to change his plea. Docket
No. 144. The United States of America and Defendant entered into a Plea and Forfeiture Agreement.
Docket No. 160. Pursuant to the plea agreement, Defendant agreed to plead guilty to Counts One and
Three of the Indictment. On May 18, 2023, Defendant appeared before this Court for a change of plea
hearing pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. See United States v.
Woodward, 387 F. 3d. 1329 (11th Cir. 2004) (holding that a magistrate judge may, with the defendant’s
consent, conduct a Rule 11 change of plea hearing). Defendant was advised of the purpose of the
hearing and placed under oath with instructions that his answers must be truthful because otherwise he
could be charged with perjury.
          II.    Consent to Proceed Before a Magistrate Judge
          Defendant was advised of his right to hold all proceedings, including this change of plea
hearing, before a district court judge. An explanation of the differences between the scope of
jurisdiction and functions of a district judge and a magistrate judge was provided. Defendant was
informed that, if he elects to proceed before a magistrate judge, the magistrate judge would conduct
the hearing and prepare a report and recommendation, subject to the review and approval of the district
judge.
          Defendant was provided with a Waiver of Right to Trial by Jury, which he signed prior to the
hearing. Docket No. 159. Defendant validated his signature and informed that his attorney had
translated the document to Spanish and had explained the document before signing the same. The Court
found that Defendant voluntarily consented to proceed before a magistrate judge and approved
Defendant’s consent.
          III.   Proceedings Under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure
          Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure governs the acceptance of guilty pleas to
federal criminal violations. Pursuant to Rule 11, for a plea of guilty to constitute a valid waiver of the
defendant’s right to trial, the guilty plea must be knowing and voluntary. United States v. Hernández
Wilson, 186 F. 3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1999). “Rule 11 was intended to ensure that a defendant who pleads
guilty does so with an ‘understanding of the nature of the charge and consequences of his plea’”. United
States v. Cotal-Crespo, 47 F. 3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting McCarthy v. United States, 394 U. S. 459,

Report and Recommendation on Guilty Plea


467 (1969)). There are three core concerns in a Rule 11 proceeding: 1) absence of coercion; 2)
understanding of the charges; and 3) knowledge of the consequences of the guilty plea.
        A. Competence to Enter a Guilty Plea
        The Court questioned Defendant about his age, education, history of any treatment for mental
illness or addiction, use of any medication, drugs or alcohol, and his understanding of the purpose of
the hearing, to ascertain his capacity to understand, answer and comprehend the change of plea
colloquy. The Court confirmed that Defendant received the Indictment and fully discussed the charges
with his attorney, and that he was satisfied with the advice and representation he received. The Court
further inquired whether Defendant’s counsel or counsel for the Government had any reservations as
to Defendant’s competency to plead, receiving answers that Defendant was competent to enter a plea.
After considering Defendant’s responses, and observing his demeanor, the Court found that Defendant
was competent to plead and fully aware of the purpose of the hearing.
        B. Plea Agreement
        Defendant was shown his plea agreement, including the stipulation of facts, and he identified
his initials and signatures. Defendant confirmed that he had the opportunity to read and discuss the
plea agreement and plea agreement supplement with his attorney, that his attorney translated both the
plea agreement and the plea agreement supplement before he signed the documents, that the plea
agreement represented the entirety of his understanding with the Government, that he understood the
terms of the plea agreement and plea agreement supplement, and that no one had made any other or
different promises or assurances to induce him to plead guilty. Counsel for the Government described
the essential terms of the plea agreement, including stipulations pertaining to the Sentencing Guidelines
and any sentencing recommendations. Counsel for the defense agreed with the Government’s
description of the terms and recommendations, and so did Defendant.
        Defendant was then admonished, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(B),
that the terms of the plea agreement are mere recommendations to the Court, and that the District Judge
who will preside over the sentencing hearing can reject the recommendations without permitting him
to withdraw his guilty plea. And that the District Judge could impose a sentence that is more severe
than what Defendant might anticipate. Defendant expressed understanding of the foregoing and
confirmed that he was aware that, if the District Judge does not follow the recommendations in the
plea agreement, he will not be allowed to withdraw his plea of guilty if he receives a sentence that is
higher than expected.

Cr. No. 22-110 (ADC)
Report and Recommendation on Guilty Plea


        C. Voluntariness
        In considering the plea agreement, Defendant acknowledged that the plea agreement contains
all the promises and agreements that he made with the Government and that no one made any other or
different promise or assurance of any kind in exchange for his guilty plea, other than the
recommendations set forth in the plea agreement. Defendant indicated that he was not being induced
to plead guilty, that he was entering such plea freely and voluntarily because in fact he is guilty, and
that no one has threatened him or offered a thing of value in exchange for his plea. Defendant
understood that the offenses to which he is pleading guilty are felonies and that, if the plea is accepted,
he will be adjudged guilty of those offenses, and that such adjudication may deprive him of valuable
civil rights, such as the right to vote, the right to hold public office, the right to serve on a jury, and the
right to possess a firearm. Defendant was also advised that by pleading guilty he is waiving his
arguments for the suppression of evidence as set forth by him at Docket No. 70. Defendant
confirmed that he understood that to be one of the consequences of pleading guilty.
        Throughout the hearing, Defendant was free to consult with his attorney or to seek clarification
from the Court. He confirmed that his agreement to plead guilty was made knowingly and voluntarily.
        D. Maximum Penalties
        Defendant expressed his understanding of the statutory maximum penalties for the offenses to
which he was pleading guilty. The maximum statutory penalties for Count One of the Indictment are
a term of imprisonment of not more than five (5) years, a fine not to exceed two hundred and fifty
thousand dollars ($250,000.00), and a term of supervised release of not less than two (2) years. Count
Three of the Indictment carries a term of imprisonment of not less than five (5) years up to life, a fine
not to exceed two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00), and a term of supervised release
of not more than five (5) years. In addition, a Special Monetary Assessment of one hundred dollars
($100.00) per count of conviction would be imposed to be deposited to the Criminal Victims Fund
pursuant to Title 18 United States Code, Section 3013(a). Defendant indicated that he understood the
maximum penalties, that the offenses charged are felonies, and the potential consequences of the guilty
plea, such as the deprivation of certain valuable rights.
        The Court then explained the nature of supervised release and the consequences of violating
conditions of supervised release. Specifically, Defendant was informed that, if supervised release is
revoked, he may be required to serve an additional term of imprisonment up to the full term of
supervised release originally imposed by the Court. And that, if he is currently on supervised release


                                                      4

Report and Recommendation on Guilty Plea


in a different case than the one object of the Indictment here, his plea of guilty, if accepted, could result
in negative consequences, such as the revocation of his supervised release in that other case. The Court
further advised Defendant that in certain cases the Court may also order, or be required to order, that
he pay restitution to any victim of the offenses, and the Court may also require him to forfeit certain
property to the Government. Defendant was also informed that any sentence imposed in this case could
be imposed to run concurrently or consecutively to any sentence he may be currently serving in another
case.
         E. Sentencing Procedure
         Defendant was informed that, in determining his sentence, the District Judge is required to
consider, but not necessarily follow, the Sentencing Guidelines. Defendant confirmed that he discussed
with his attorney how the Sentencing Guidelines might apply to this case. Defendant was specifically
informed that the Court, after considering the applicable Sentencing Guidelines, could impose a
sentence different from any estimate in the plea agreement or provided by his attorney, and that the
Court had the authority to impose a sentence that is more severe or less severe than the sentence called
for by the Sentencing Guidelines. Defendant was advised, and informed to have understood, that the
Sentencing Guidelines are thus considered advisory, and that during sentencing the District Court will
consider the sentencing criteria found at Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(a), which include
the seriousness of the offenses, the need for deterrence of criminal conduct, the need to protect the
public from further crimes, the need to provide Defendant with educational or vocational training, or
medical care, and the need to provide restitution to any victims.
         Defendant was advised that parole has been abolished and that, if he is sentenced to prison, he
will not be released on parole. Further, Defendant was advised of his right to appeal and that, under
some circumstances, he or the Government may have the right to appeal the sentence imposed by the
Court. But that, pursuant to his plea agreement, he is waiving his right to appeal both the judgment and
sentence imposed by the Court, if the Court accepts his plea agreement and sentences him to sixty-six
(66) months or less of imprisonment. Defendant informed that he understood his right to appeal and
that he voluntarily agreed to this waiver.
         F. Waiver of Constitutional Rights
         Defendant was specifically advised that he has the right to persist in a plea of not guilty and
that, if he does, he has the right to a speedy trial by jury, or trial before a judge sitting without a jury if
the Court and the Government so agree; that at trial he would be presumed innocent and the

Report and Recommendation on Guilty Plea


Government would have to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt; that he would have the right to
the assistance of counsel for his defense, and that, if he could not afford one, an attorney would be
appointed to represent him through all stages of the proceedings; that at trial he would have the right
to hear and cross examine all witnesses, the right to issue subpoenas or to compel the attendance of
witnesses to testify at trial, and the right to testify or to remain silent. Defendant was further advised
that if he decided not to testify or put on evidence at trial, the failure to do so could not be used against
him, and that at trial the jury would have to return a unanimous verdict before he could be found guilty
or not guilty.
        Defendant specifically acknowledged understanding these rights. He reaffirmed his
understanding that by entering a plea of guilty there would be no trial and he would be waiving or
giving up the rights that the Court explained.
        G. Offenses Charged and Factual Basis for the Guilty Plea
        Defendant was read in open court Counts One and Three of the Indictment and was provided
an explanation of technical terms used in the Indictment to describe the charges. Defendant was also
provided an explanation of the elements of the offenses. Defendant expressed that he understood the
charges in Counts One and Three and the elements of the offenses, and what the Government would
have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt if he were to go to trial.
        The Government explained the factual basis for the offenses and the evidence it would present
if this case were to proceed to trial. Upon questioning, Defendant admitted to the facts, constituting all
the elements of the offenses charged. Defendant admitted that he was pleading guilty because he is in
fact guilty. Defendant pled guilty as to Counts One and Three of the Indictment.
        IV.      Conclusion
        Defendant appeared before me, by consent, pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedures and entered a plea of guilty as to Counts One and Three of the Indictment.
        After cautioning and examining Defendant under oath and in open court concerning each of
the subject matters in Rule 11, the Court finds that the defendant, Irving Vidot-Vargas is fully
competent and capable of entering this guilty plea, is aware of the nature of the charges and the
maximum statutory penalties these carry, understands that the charges are supported by evidence and
a basis in fact, has admitted to the facts and the elements of the offenses, and has done so in an
intelligent and voluntary manner with knowledge of the consequences of his guilty plea.
