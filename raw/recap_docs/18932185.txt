                          UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                       FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

        v.                                         Case No. 09-cr-167-PB

Charles A. Allen, III

                                      O R D E R


        The defendant has moved, through counsel, to continue the

trial scheduled for a period of 30 days citing new counsel and

the need for additional time to finalize a negotiated plea

agreement.        The government does not object to a continuance of

the trial date.

        Accordingly, to allow the parties additional time to

properly prepare for trial or other negotiated disposition, the

court will continue the trial from February 2, 2010 to March 2,

2010.    In agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds

pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(7)(A) that for the above-stated

reasons, the ends of justice served in granting a continuance

outweigh the best interests of the public and the defendant in a

speedy trial.
