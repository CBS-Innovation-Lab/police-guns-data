                        IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                          FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO

 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
 Plaintiff,

                   v.                             CRIMINAL NO. 99-077(JAF)

 FEDERICO VILLARMAN OVIEDO,
 Defendant.

                        UNITED STATES MOTION IN RESPONSE TO
                        DEFENDANT’S REQUEST FOR NEW TRIAL

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE:

       COMES NOW, the United States of America, through the undersigned attorney’s

and very respectfully states as follows:

       1.     This defendant seeks a new trial based on the fact that the District court did

not allow him to impeach a government witness. Defendant alleges he is entitled to the

above relief based on the case of Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004).

       2.     Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure specifically states that

the court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so

requires. The motion for new trial must be filed within 3 years after the verdict or finding

of guilty, that is, if the request is made on newly discovered evidence or, if on other

grounds, the request should be filed within 7 days.

       3.    Defendant’s request is therefore untimely; further the basis for such request

appears to be that he was denied the right to cross-examine a witness. Under those

bases, he must have filed a timely appeal before the First Circuit.

       WHEREFORE, the United States submits that defendant’s motion should be

denied.
