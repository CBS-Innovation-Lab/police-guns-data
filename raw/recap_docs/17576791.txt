STATEMENT OF REASONS

Vll COURT DETERM|NATIONS OF RES'I`l'l`UTlON
A m Restitution Not Applicable.
B Total Amount of Restitution:

C Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

1 m For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under iB U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

2 m For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
issues offset and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c}(3)(B)`
3 [___l For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3663 and)'or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh
the need to provide restitution to any victims under |S U.S,C. § 3663(s}(l)(B)(ii).

4 [:l Restitution is not ordered for other reasons (Explain.)
