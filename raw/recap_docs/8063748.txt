                  GOVERNMENT'S SENTENCING MEMORANDUM

     Due to the unique travel of this case and upon review of the

Presentence Report (PSR), the government recommends a sentence of

97 months imprisonment, a sentence which is significantly below

the low end of the guideline range.

     On November 19, 2007, the defendant pled guilty to

possession of marihuana with the intent to distribute in

violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), being a felon in possession

of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g), and possession

of a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking in violation of

18 U.S.C. § 924(c).    Prior to signing the plea agreement, the

defense counsel and the government discussed the applicable

guideline range.    Although the government made no guarantees

regarding its estimate of the guideline range, the government did

estimate that the range, in light of the defendant’s career

offender status, would be 37-46 months imprisonment, with a

consecutive 60 month term of imprisonment on Count III.            That is,
   Case 1:07-cr-00123-S-DLM   Document 14   Filed 03/17/2008   Page 2 of 4



the government estimated that the defendant’s guideline range

would be 97 - 106 months imprisonment.

     On February 28, 2008, the U.S. Probation Office prepared a

PSR which calculated the defendant’s guideline range to be 262-

327 months, inclusive of a five-year consecutive sentence on

Count III.   The probation officer arrived at this guideline range

by applying U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(c)(3), the provision of the career

offender guideline applicable to career offenders who violate 18

U.S.C. § 924(c).    It appears that the probation officer correctly

applied the guidelines in this case.        No objections have been

filed.

     The defendant’s guideline range of 262-327 months is

significantly above the range estimated by the government.             While

the government does not speak for the defendant, in estimating

the guideline range, the government overlooked the impact of

U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(c)(3) on the defendant’s guideline range.             As a

result, the defendant’s low-end guideline range is 165 months

above the estimate of the government.

     While the government believes that the defendant would have

no grounds to complain about the guideline range in light of the

Court’s change of plea colloquy with the defendant, the

government believes that given the difference between its

estimate communicated to defense counsel and the guideline range

in the PSR, in the interest of fairness, the government will
