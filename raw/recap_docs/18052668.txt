                         MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
                           December 4, 2015

Saris, Chief Judge.

     Pro se petitioner Claude Pelissier has moved under 28

U.S.C. § 2255 for habeas relief on the grounds (1) that he is

actually innocent of being a felon in possession of a firearm

pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) and (2) that his attorney was

ineffective. The motion is DENIED.

     With respect to the first issue, Pelissier pled guilty to

being a felon in possession. Section 922(g)(1) makes it unlawful

for any person “who has been convicted in any court of a crime

punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year” to

possess a firearm. Section 922(a)(2) also provides that the term

“crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year”

does not include “any State offense classified by the laws of


                                    1

the States as a misdemeanor and punishable by a term of

imprisonment of two years or less.” Petitioner had three

convictions which met this definition: (1) breaking and entering

at night into a boat or vehicle with the intent to commit a

felony, M.G.L. c. 266, § 16; (2) possession of burglarious

tools, M.G.L. c. 266, § 49; and (3) resisting arrest, M.G.L. c.

268, § 32B. All are “punishable” by not more than two and one-

half years. The fact that Pelissier was punished by less than

one year is immaterial so long as he was “punishable” by more

than one year. See, e.g., United States v. Jones, 195 F.3d 205,

207 (4th Cir. 1999); United States v. Qualls, 108 F.3d 1019,

1021-22 (9th Cir. 1997).

     Petitioner argues that he is actually innocent under

Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, 560 U.S. 563 (2010) because his

predicate offenses do not qualify as felonies. However,

Carachuri-Rosendo involved the complex question of whether a

state misdemeanor drug possession conviction fell within the

definition of “aggravated felony” under the Immigration and

Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101. For purposes of that

immigration statute, “felony” was defined as a crime “for which

the maximum term of imprisonment authorized” is “more than one

year.” § 3559(a). Rejecting the government’s argument that the

petitioner could “hypothetically” be convicted for a felony as a



                                    2

recidivist drug possessor under federal law, the Supreme Court

held:

             The mere possibility that the defendant’s conduct,
             coupled with facts outside of the record of conviction,
             could have authorized a felony conviction under federal
             law is insufficient to satisfy the statutory command
             that a noncitizen be “convicted of an aggravated felony”
             before he loses the opportunity to seek cancellation of
             removal.

Carachuri-Rosendo, 560 U.S. at 582. As the Court pointed out,

the term “aggravated felony” is unique to immigration law and

does not appear elsewhere within the United States Code. Id. at

574.

        Accordingly, Carachuri-Rosendo is inapplicable to the felon

in possession statute, which defines the predicate offense not

as an “aggravated felony” but as a “crime punishable for a term

exceeding one year.” 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). Courts to address

the issue have rejected similar arguments. See Stokes v. United

States, No. 12-925, 2014 WL 5198746 (M.D. Al. Oct. 14, 2014)

(Carachuri “wholly inapplicable” to convictions under §

922(g)(1)); United States v. St. Clair, No. 12-294, 2012 WL

1309368 at *2 (W.D. Pa. Apr. 16, 2012) (same); Bogardus v.

United States, No. 110-155, 2012 WL 292870 (S.D. Ga. Jan. 4,

2012) (“Carachuri did not alter the definition of a federal

felony” or render hypothetical offenses for which the actual

sentence imposed is less than one year).

     Petitioner’s second argument also fails. He asserts that

his original counsel was ineffective in advising him to remain

in federal custody instead of returning him to state custody

where he could get possible good time and parole reductions.

But Pelissier’s counsel did raise this argument at sentencing

and this Court adjusted the sentence accordingly. See Docket No.

67-1, Sentencing Tr. at 9, 13, 21-22. As such, he was not

prejudiced. See, e.g., Tevlin v. Spencer, 621 F.3d 59, 66 (1st

Cir. 2010) (“A defendant’s failure to satisfy one prong of the

Strickland analysis obviates the need for a court to consider

the remaining prong.”). Moreover, the issue is moot because

petitioner is no longer in custody based on the original

conviction.

                                        ORDER

     For the foregoing reasons, the petitioner’s motion pursuant

to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 is DENIED.
