YOUNG, D.J.                                           December 31, 2009
I.   INTRODUCTION

     Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255, Anthony Bucci (“Bucci”) seeks
to vacate his sentence due to alleged constitutional violations

during his trial and sentencing.       Bucci’s Pet. [Doc. No. 398]2.

He presents five grounds for his relief.       Bucci’s Mem. Supp. §


     1
       Bucci’s co-defendant David Jordan filed his own petition
pro se. He primarily raises the courtroom closure issue
discussed infra. His other grounds either track Bucci’s or are
completely without merit. Accordingly, this opinion will do duty
for both cases.

2255 Mot. (“Bucci’s Mem.”) [Doc. No. 400].       In Ground One, Bucci

alleges that his right to a public trial was violated because the

judge closed the courtroom to the public during jury empanelment.

Bucci next claims that the prosecution violated its duty to

disclose evidence exculpating Bucci, Ground Two, and committed

other outrageous misconduct, Ground Three.       In Grounds Four and

Five Bucci alleges ineffective assistance of counsel at the trial

and sentencing proceedings.      The government denies each of these

claims.     Government’s Mot. Summ. Dismissal (“Gov.’s Mem.”) [Doc.

No. 413].
     A.     Procedural Posture

     Bucci was tried before a jury in the United States District

Court in March 2006.    He was convicted on Counts 1, 2, and 5

(conspiracy to distribute cocaine, aiding and abetting, and

possession with intent to distribute cocaine) as well as on Count

3 pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(1)(A) (using or carrying a firearm

during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime).         He was

sentenced to a total of 252 months, 168 months on drug charges

(Counts 1, 2, and 5) and a consecutive term of 84 months pursuant

to 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A) for the firearm charge (Count 3).

Bucci’s Mem. 88.    On appeal, Bucci’s conviction and sentence were

affirmed.    United States v. Bucci, No. 06-2746 (1st Cir. May 13,
2008) [Doc. No. 390].
     B.     Facts

     This case involves a number of drug dealers: Bucci, Jon

Minotti (“Minotti”), Carlos Ruiz (“Ruiz”), and a corrupt police


                                    2
      Case 1:04-cr-10194-GAO Document 460 Filed 12/31/09 Page 3 of 27



officer David Jordan (“Jordan”).        Bucci, unsatisfied with the

quality of drugs purchased from Ruiz, intended to steal drugs

from Ruiz, and needed assistance.       He approached Minotti, a long

time friend of Jordan.     The three planned to arrange a

transaction between Ruiz and Bucci with Minotti as a middleman.

When Minotti went to transfer three kilograms of cocaine from

Ruiz’s car to Bucci’s car, in accordance with the scheme, Jordan

arrived at the scene and identified himself as a Malden Police

Officer.   Jordan was in plain clothes and he pointed a gun at

Ruiz’s head.     Minotti escaped with the narcotics, and both Ruiz

and Bucci were let go after Jordan frisked and questioned them.

Unbeknownst to Jordan, police were monitoring Ruiz’s

transactions, and Jordan’s involvement was soon discovered.
      C.   Federal Jurisdiction

      This Court may exercise jurisdiction over Bucci’s petition

for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 because he is detained

pursuant to conviction and a sentence from a federal court.
II.   ANALYSIS

      A.   Standard of review

      Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255, a court may discharge or

resentence a defendant if it concludes that the sentence “was

imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United

States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such

sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum

authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack.”

28 U.S.C. § 2255(a).     As a general matter, claims not raised on


                                    3
     Case 1:04-cr-10194-GAO Document 460 Filed 12/31/09 Page 4 of 27



direct appeal may not be raised on collateral proceedings such as

a petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255, unless the petitioner

shows cause that excuses the procedural default, and actual

prejudice that resulted from the alleged error.        United States v.

Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 167 (1982).       “The habeas petitioner must

show ‘not merely that the errors at . . . trial created a

possibility of prejudice, but that they worked to his actual and

substantial disadvantage, infecting his entire trial with error

of constitutional dimensions.’”      Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478,

494 (1986) (citing Frady, 456 U.S. at 170).
     B.    Bucci’s claims

           1.   Courtroom closure (Ground One)

     Bucci claims that the exclusion of some of his family and

friends from the courtroom during jury empanelment violated his

Sixth Amendment right to a public trial.       Because Bucci

procedurally defaulted on this Sixth Amendment claim, he must

normally show cause and actual prejudice.       Frady, 456 U.S. at

167-68.   If, however, a total closure of the courtroom occurred
without sufficient justification as Bucci contends, this would

constitute “structural error,” relieving Bucci of the burden to

show actual prejudice.    Owens v. United States, 483 F.3d 48, 64
(1st Cir. 2007) (“[A] defendant who is seeking to excuse a

procedurally defaulted claim of structural error [such as failure

to hold a public trial] need not establish actual prejudice.”).

     While there is no record of courtroom closure in the

official trial transcript, Bucci alleges - and the government


                                   4
     Case 1:04-cr-10194-GAO Document 460 Filed 12/31/09 Page 5 of 27



does not deny - that on the morning of March 20, 2006, the

courtroom was cleared of spectators to make way for the jury

venire and not all members of the public were allowed back in

that morning.   This Court held an evidentiary hearing over the

course of three days better to determine the course of events as

they unfolded during the first day of Bucci’s trial.         During the

hearing, the Court heard the testimony of witnesses present on

March 20, 2006, including some members of Bucci’s friends and

family, the courtroom deputy clerk assigned to Judge Reginald

Lindsay (“Judge Lindsay”), the official court reporter for the

session, the jury commissioner, and Bucci’s trial lawyers.             This

Court finds the following facts:3

                a.   Findings of fact

     Jury empanelment for the Bucci-Jordan criminal trial was

scheduled to take place on Monday, March 20, 2006.         Judge

Lindsay, who was wheelchair bound, presided over the trial in

Courtroom 11 of the John Joseph Moakley Courthouse.         Courtroom 11

was and still is the only courtroom in the building equipped with
a lift that enabled Judge Lindsay to get onto the bench.           The

public area in Courtroom 11 has fourteen benches, each of which

seat four people comfortably, for a normal capacity of fifty-six

     3
       The Court delivered its findings of fact from the bench on
the last day of the evidentiary hearing. This is a salutary
practice as the testimony is fresh and vivid in the judge’s mind.
It also serves to move a case forward expeditiously. In the
main, the factual findings set forth here simply re-state, in
more readable form, the Court’s findings made from the bench. In
certain respects, however, they are different in light of a
careful review of the transcripts of the hearing and the trial.
Each difference is distinctly noted in the text.

persons.   Hr’g Tr. vol. 3 at 15.       Prior to March 20, realizing

that this trial involved two defendants, one of whom was a police

officer, Courtroom Deputy Clerk Lisa Hourihan (“Ms. Hourihan”)

arranged to obtain a larger venire than usual.         After a

discussion with Judge Lindsay, Ms. Hourihan ordered sixty-five

jurors.    Hr’g Tr. vol. 1 at 12-13; Hr’g Tr. vol. 3 at 5.

      On March 20, 2006, the Official Court Reporter for the

session Deborah Joyce (“Joyce”), as was her routine, unlocked the

doors of the courtroom prior to 9:00 a.m.        Hr’g Tr. vol. 1 at 92-

93.   Once the doors were unlocked, various members of the public

including, Bucci’s mother, Rosemarie Keefe (“Mrs. Keefe”);

Bucci’s wife, Melissa Bucci(“Mrs. Bucci”); Jordan’s wife (“Mrs.

Jordan”), Michael Kevin Dupont4 (“Dupont”); other members of the

defendants’ family and friends; and a few other spectators, took

seats in the public area of the courtroom.        Id. at 18-19, 95-96;

Hr’g Tr. vol. 2 at 13-14; Bucci’s Mem., Ex. 7.         Between the time

that the doors opened and the time that the jury venire was

brought to the courtroom, counsel for the government and the
defendants as well as the courtroom staff went about setting up

for the proceedings.     Judge Lindsay was not present in the


      4
       Dupont was a well-known and frequent pro-se litigant in
Judge Lindsay’s session. On this occasion, the Bucci family had
hired Dupont to take notes for them and provide his insight
during the trial. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1 at 128. Bucci’s counsel,
however, had no relationship to Dupont and did not confer with
Dupont with respect to Bucci’s representation. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2
at 68. The supreme irony of these cases is that, as will be seen
below, it is Dupont’s conduct which forestalled a closure of the
courtroom and the “structural error” that would have voided these
convictions.

                                    6

courtroom and he did not enter the courtroom at any time before

the jury venire was already present.      Hr’g Tr. vol. 1 at 15, 17,

99; Hr’g Tr. vol. 3 at 28.

     When the Jury Commissioner notified Ms. Hourihan that the

venire was ready to come up to the courtroom, there were

approximately twelve to twenty-five spectators seated in the

public area.   Realizing that there would hardly be room for the

sixty-five potential jurors as the courtroom comfortably sat

fifty-six persons, Ms. Hourihan asked spectators sitting in the

public area to clear the courtroom to make way for the jury.

Hr’g Tr. vol. 1 at 17-18, 94.     As the public exited the courtroom

into the hallway, Dupont told Ms. Hourihan that Bucci’s family

members had a right to be present for the jury selection.          Id. at

19-20.   Ms. Hourihan then went out through the back doors of the

courtroom and consulted Judge Lindsay.       Id. at 20, 96.

Afterwards, Ms. Hourihan cleared a bench in the first row on the

left side of the courtroom (facing towards the bench), which was

usually kept vacant because the audio/video podium blocked it
from the judge’s line of sight.      Id. at 20.    Ms. Hourihan went

out into the hallway and invited Mrs. Keefe, Mrs. Bucci, and Mrs.

Jordan to come back in and sit at this bench in the first row.

Id. at 21, 96-97; Hr’g Tr. vol. 3 at 23; Hr’g Tr. vol. 2 at 98.

     While Mrs. Keefe, Mrs. Bucci, and Mrs. Jordan took their

seats, the venire lined up outside the courtroom in the order

their names had randomly been placed on the jury list, as was the

practice of the session.    Hr’g Tr. vol. 3 at 6.      Shortly


                                   7
     Case 1:04-cr-10194-GAO Document 460 Filed 12/31/09 Page 8 of 27



thereafter, they were brought into the courtroom and filled in

the remaining benches, preserving the order in which they had

lined up.5   The venire sat shoulder to shoulder, five persons to

a bench rather than the usual four, given that there were

thirteen benches left and sixty-five venire members.         Ms.

Hourihan then called the court to order, Judge Lindsay came onto

the bench, and the proceedings began at 10:40 a.m., at which time

the official transcript also begins.      Trial Tr. Jury Trial Day

One, 1, March 20, 2006.    This Court explicitly finds that the

record maintained by Joyce was a complete and accurate record of

the events in court starting at 10:40 a.m. that day.

     The record reflects that, as was Judge Lindsay’s practice,

he first conducted a voir dire of the entire panel.         Those who

answered affirmatively to any of his questions stood up, stated

their names, and sat back down.      Ms. Hourihan then filled the

jury box with the first twelve venire members on the jury list,

and those who had answered affirmatively to any of the voir dire

questions proceeded one by one from the jury box to sidebar for

further questioning.    Next, Judge Lindsay excused jurors whom he

determined not to be indifferent, and those excused jurors left

the courtroom.   After there were twelve indifferent persons in

the jury box, counsel exercised their peremptory challenges and

those jurors excused left the courtroom as well.        More venire

     5
       Judge Lindsay employed this practice - one that benefits
both the defense and the government - of seating venirepersons in
the order their names appeared on the jury list so that counsel
could discern which succeeding members would replace the most
recently excused jurors.

                                   8
     Case 1:04-cr-10194-GAO Document 460 Filed 12/31/09 Page 9 of 27



members then filled the jury box in place of those excused, and

the process was repeated until a jury was selected.6         See Hr’g

Tr. vol. 1 at 26-27.

     It was not until approximately 11:40 a.m. that the first

juror who had been excused for cause left the courtroom.          Trial

Tr. 31; Hr’g Tr. vol. 3 at 10 (Jury Commissioner testifying that


     6
       The great legal philosopher Lon L. Fuller praised the
adversary system as the system most effective at preventing a
fact-finder from determining things unknown on the basis of what
the fact-finder already knows. L. Fuller, The Forms and Limits
of Adjudication, 92 Harv. L. Rev. 353, 383 (1978). As fact-
finder in this case, I acknowledge that I am intimately familiar
with the layout of Courtroom 11, having sat there on a variety of
occasions. Moreover, I myself empanel juries following a
protocol much like that followed by Judge Lindsay here.
     This familiarity led me to make an erroneous initial factual
finding of more than marginal significance. In my initial
findings and rulings, I said that allowing more spectators back
into the courtroom at any time during empanelment would have
resulted in such spectators “sitting in and among the venire.”
Hr’g Tr. vol. 3 at 96. This is erroneous. I came to this
conclusion because it is my practice to deal with the challenges
for cause before filling the box and I assumed (erroneously) that
Judge Lindsay empanelled in the same fashion.
     A close review of the hearing transcript, however, convinces
me that is not the way Judge Lindsay empanelled. As mentioned
above, he would first fill the jury box, then excuse jurors for
cause, and replace them with jurors next in line. Hr’g Tr. vol.
1 at 26-27. This method results in spectator benches being
emptied sequentially from front to back.
     Thus had spectators been allowed back into the courtroom,
they could have been seated in empty benches in front of the
remaining venirepersons, rather than “among” the venire.
Spectators might, therefore, have filled those benches, bench by
bench, sitting no closer to the venire than the bench occupied by
Mrs. Bucci, Mrs. Keefe, and Mrs. Jordan.
     Still, admitting spectators bench by bench as benches became
vacant would greatly have increased the risk of inappropriate
interaction between the venire and the spectators. Moreover, it
would have interposed two rows of spectators between the
remaining venire and the sight lines of counsel and Judge
Lindsay, thus markedly decreasing the value to counsel derived
from closely observing the potential jurors most likely to next
be called to sit.

generally, the first juror did not return to the jury assembly

room from Judge Lindsay’s courtroom until an hour or an hour and

fifteen minutes after jury selection began).        From that time

until the lunch recess at 1:15 p.m., twenty7 more jurors were

excused and left the courtroom.      Trial Tr. 51-86.     Thus, from

11:40 a.m. to 1:15 p.m., a total of twenty-one jurors left the

courtroom.

     As jury selection proceeded inside the courtroom, one to two

court security officers (the “Court Officers”) stood outside the

double doors.   The doors remained unlocked throughout the day.

Hr’g Tr. vol. 1 at 57-58, 92.      From 10:40 a.m. until the lunch

recess at 1:15 p.m., however, the Court Officers observed in good

faith Ms. Hourihan’s earlier direction for the public to clear

courtroom, and denied entry to anyone who attempted to enter the

courtroom.   As some witnesses testified, one or both of the Court

Officers also said that the courtroom was closed for empanelment

all day.   See, e.g., Hr’g Tr. vol. 2 at 148.       Although not all

persons initially asked to clear the courtroom sought reentry,
some of Bucci’s family members arriving later that morning,

including Bucci’s daughters and aunt, did request entry and were

denied.    Id. at 130-131, 148.    Thus, while twenty-one jurors

exited the courtroom between 11:40 a.m. and 1:15 p.m., the Court

Officers continued to prohibit spectators from entering the

courtroom.

     7
       The Court’s initial fact-finding was “19," Hr’g Tr. vol. 3
at 91. An actual count of excused jurors from the trial
transcript yields “20."

     Case 1:04-cr-10194-GAO Document 460 Filed 12/31/09 Page 11 of 27



     At approximately 1:15 p.m., when the court took a lunch

recess, Judge Lindsay expressly admonished counsel to ensure that

the defendants and their family members did not mingle with

jurors during lunch.     Trial Tr. 85-86.    He then released the

venire through the public doors and Mrs. Keefe, Mrs. Bucci, and

Mrs. Jordan left the courtroom as well.       Sometime prior to 2:15

p.m., when the lunch recess was scheduled to end, counsel, the

defendants, and others including Mrs. Keefe and Mrs. Bucci

reentered the courtroom through the unlocked double doors.              At

approximately 2:15 p.m., jury selection resumed and proceeded

until approximately 2:40 p.m.      Trial Tr. 86-102.     This Court

finds that after the court recessed for lunch around 1:15 p.m.,

there were no further efforts by any court personnel to bar entry

into the courtroom.     Indeed, there is no evidence that anyone

attempted to enter and was denied entry after 1:15 p.m.

Therefore, the only issue raised by Bucci’s closure argument ends

as of the lunch recess at 1:15 p.m.

                  b.   Analysis

     “A defendant has a right to a trial that is open to members

of the public.”    Owens v. United States, 483 F.3d 48, 61 (1st

Cir. 2007) (citing Waller v. Georgia, 467 U.S. 39, 46 (1984)).

The public trial guarantee benefits the defendant as it

discourages perjury, encourages witnesses to come forward, and

ensures that the judge and prosecutor carry out their duties

responsibly.   Waller, 467 U.S. at 46 (internal citations

omitted).   See Gannett Co., Inc. v. DePasquale, 443 U.S. 368, 383


                                   11
      Case 1:04-cr-10194-GAO Document 460 Filed 12/31/09 Page 12 of 27



(1979) (“Openness in court proceedings may improve the quality of

testimony, induce unknown witnesses to come forward . . . , cause

all trial participants to perform their duties more

conscientiously, and generally give the public an opportunity to

observe the judicial system.”); In re Oliver, 333 U.S. 257, 270

(1948) (“The knowledge that every criminal trial is subject to

contemporaneous review in the forum of public opinion is an

effective restraint on possible abuse of judicial power.”).              As

the First Circuit has recognized, the public trial guarantee

applies with full force to jury selection as it is “one of the

most important phases of a criminal trial.”         Owens, 483 F.3d at
64.   The watchful public eye encourages jurors to be forthcoming

about biases and past experiences, and encourages both parties to

pick an impartial jury.      Id. at 65.

      Given the importance of an open courtroom, trial closures

excluding the public should be “‘rare and only for cause shown

that outweighs the value of openness.’”        Id. at 61 (quoting

Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., 464 U.S. 501, 509
(1984)).   In particular, a trial closure may be justified only

when: there is an overriding interest and closure is essential to

preserve higher values; the closure is narrowly tailored to serve

the overriding interest; the court has considered alternatives to

closure; and there are specific findings to enable a reviewing

court to determine whether closure was proper.          Waller, 467 U.S.
at 45; Owens, 483 F.3d at 61-62.         In this case, Bucci alleges

that the district court failed to comply with the Waller


                                    12
     Case 1:04-cr-10194-GAO Document 460 Filed 12/31/09 Page 13 of 27



requirements before closing the courtroom on the first day of the

trial.   In particular, Bucci alleges that the district court did

not make specific findings as to an overriding interest, and

neglected to consider alternatives to courtroom closure.          Bucci’s

argument fails, however, because this Court holds that no closure

occurred, and thus the trial court was not required to comply

with Waller.

     First, no closure occurred the morning of March 20, 2006

when Courtroom Deputy Clerk Hourihan initially cleared the

courtroom of at least twelve to twenty-five spectators to make

space for the jury venire, and subsequently invited back in only

three members of the defendants’ families.        “A public trial

implies only that the court must be open to those who wish to

come, sit in the available seats, conduct themselves with

decorum, and observe the trial process.”        Estes v. Texas, 381
U.S. 532, 589 (1965) (emphasis added).       At the commencement of

Bucci’s jury selection, there were sixty-five persons in the

venire, more than could sit comfortably in the courtroom’s public

area; thus, Ms. Hourihan, as was customary, asked the public to

exit the courtroom.    When Dupont protested to the absence of

Bucci’s family members, however, the court reasonably

accommodated the defendants’ closest family members.          After the

venire filled in the remaining thirteen benches, there was in

essence no available seating remaining, and three members of the




                                   13
     Case 1:04-cr-10194-GAO Document 460 Filed 12/31/09 Page 14 of 27



public were present when jury empanelment began.8         Hr’g Tr. vol.

3 at 23.   That other members of the public were not allowed into

the courtroom does not amount to a closure implicating the Sixth

Amendment.    Estes, 381 U.S. at 588-89 (“Obviously, the public

trial guarantee is not violated if an individual member of the

public cannot gain admittance to a courtroom because there are no

available seats.    The guarantee will already have been met, for

the ‘public’ will be present in the form of those persons who did

gain admission.”).    See Owens v. United States, 517 F. Supp. 2d

570, 575 n.7 (D. Mass. 2007)      (Gertner, J.) (“The [trial court’s]

closure did not necessarily become constitutionally significant

at the point when spectators were asked to leave . . . but rather

when they were not permitted to return after some jurors were

excused.”).

     The more difficult question is whether a closure occurred

when outside the courtroom, the Court Officers - unbeknownst to

Judge Lindsay and Ms. Hourihan inside the courtroom - continued

to prohibit members of the public from entering the courtroom

even as seats became available.      Throughout the morning, between

approximately 11:40 a.m. and the 1:15 p.m. lunch recess, twenty-

one venire members were excused and left the courtroom one by

one, but the Court Officers continued to deny entry.          Bucci


     8
       The Court notes that a bench in Courtroom 11 sits four
persons comfortably and could have squeezed in five. Thus, to be
completely precise, the court could have allowed one to two more
spectators to sit with Mrs. Bucci, Mrs. Keefe, and Mrs. Jordan.
It is, however, of no constitutional moment that the court did
not do so.

                                   14
     Case 1:04-cr-10194-GAO Document 460 Filed 12/31/09 Page 15 of 27



argues that the actions of the Court Officers defy the holding of

Owens.   There, the defendant alleged a violation of his public

trial right when the court cleared the courtroom of spectators to

make way for the jury and did not allow any members of the public

to enter even as jurors exited.      The First Circuit held that a

defendant’s right to a public trial would indeed be violated if

the trial court excluded all members of the public for the

entirety of jury empanelment without complying with Waller.

Owens, 483 F.3d at 63.     In Owens, the trial court did not make

findings on the record justifying the continuing exclusion of the

public even as venire members began to leave.        The First Circuit

stated, “[o]nce there was sufficient space in the courtroom, we

see no state interest . . . in not permitting Owens’ family,

friends, or other members of the public to observe the

proceedings.”   Id. at 62.
     The present case, however, is distinguishable from Owens on

at least one principal ground.      In Owens, the First Circuit

believed that no members of the public were present for the

entire day of jury selection.      Here in contrast, members of the

public - specifically, Mrs. Keefe, Mrs. Bucci, and Mrs. Jordan

who likely were the most invested spectators - were present,

keenly casting their watchful eye upon the entirety of the

empanelment.9   This Court holds that in light of the public


     9
       Indeed, Mrs. Keefe - whose testimony showed her to be a
devoted mother who carefully followed every moment of the trial,
talked to her son every day during his incarceration, and even
led the effort to collect affidavits for Bucci’s habeas petition

                                   15
     Case 1:04-cr-10194-GAO Document 460 Filed 12/31/09 Page 16 of 27



presence during jury selection and the trial judge’s power to

place reasonable time, place, and manner limits on trial access,

the fact that other spectators were not allowed to fill the seats

of the excused jurors throughout the morning does not violate

Bucci’s constitutional right to a public trial.

     The First Circuit’s recent holding in United States v.

Scott, 564 F.3d 34 (2009), is instructive.        In Scott, the

defendant alleged that his right to a public trial was violated

when the court barred members of the public from entering or

leaving the courtroom during the jury charge.        The First Circuit

noted that the trial court announced to then-present spectators

that they were welcome to stay in the courtroom during the charge

but they would not be permitted to leave, “presumably to avoid

distracting the jury during the . . . charge.”         Id. at 37-38.
Distinguishing the case from Owens, the court held that no

closure had occurred because the “public was indeed present at

the jury charge and with its presence cast the sharp light of

public scrutiny on the trial proceedings, thus providing the
defendant with the protections anticipated by the public trial

provision of the Constitution.”      Id. at 38 (citing Herring v.
Meachum, 11 F.3d 374, 379-80 (2d Cir. 1993)).        The court went on

to state, “that a hypothetical member of the public who arrived




- was likely the most important member of the public to be
present from Bucci’s perspective. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2 at 30, 33.

                                   16
     Case 1:04-cr-10194-GAO Document 460 Filed 12/31/09 Page 17 of 27



late . . . might have been barred from the proceedings does not

undermine the public nature of the proceedings.”10        Id. at 38.

     The holdings in Scott and similar cases are in line with the
trial judge’s inherent power to “impose reasonable limitations on

access to a trial” to ensure the fair and efficient

administration of justice.     Press-Enterprise, 464 U.S. at 510

n.10 (citing Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555,

581 n.18 (1980)); Scott, 564 F.3d at 38-39 (praising trial court

for preserving defendant’s right to a public trial “while also

facilitating the orderly and efficient functioning of the

courtroom”).   See also Meachum, 11 F.3d at 380 (“Reasonable time,
place, and manner limitations on access to the courtroom are

permitted to ensure the fair and efficient administration of

justice.”); Snyder v. Coiner, 510 F.2d 224, 230 (4th Cir. 1975)

(holding that judge had power to limit ingress and egress of




     10
       Other jurisdictions that have considered this issue have
also held that prohibiting public ingress and egress during a
jury charge does not constitute “closure” under the Sixth
Amendment. E.g., Herring v. Meachum, 11 F.3d 374, 380 (2d Cir.
1993) (holding that trial was never “closed” when court locked
doors during jury charge because all members of the public who
wanted to observe the charge were permitted to do so if there was
enough space and they arrived in time); Bell v. Evatt, 72 F.3d
421, 433 (4th Cir. 1995) (“[A] defendant’s right to a public
trial is not implicated by temporary limitation of ingress and
egress to the courtroom to prevent disturbance of the
proceedings.”); Commonwealth v. Dykens, 438 Mass. 827, 835-36
(2003) (holding that no closure occurred when judge did not allow
anyone to enter or leave courtroom during jury instructions);
Commonwealth v. Hartman, 536 Pa. 211, 218 (1994) (holding that no
closure occurred where judge locked doors to ensure jury would
not be distracted); Davidson v. State, 591 So. 2d 901, 902-903
(Ala. Crim. App. 1991) (same).

                                   17
     Case 1:04-cr-10194-GAO Document 460 Filed 12/31/09 Page 18 of 27



persons during counsels’ final arguments because it was a

reasonable limitation to prevent disturbance).

     In Bucci’s case, as in the jury charge cases, members of the

public filled the available seats in the courtroom and were

present, casting the “sharp light of public scrutiny” upon the

entirety of the jury empanelment.       The exclusion of other members

of Bucci’s family and friends throughout the morning even as

seats became available does not undermine the public nature of

that empanelment.    See Scott, 564 F.3d at 38 (ruling that while

the barring of hypothetical late-arriving members of the public

might have implications for the barred individual’s right of

access, it has no bearing on the public nature of the

proceedings).   The presence of the defendants’ closest family

members vindicated their public trial rights by ensuring that the

defendants were “fairly dealt with and not unjustly condemned”

and by “keep[ing] [the defendants’] triers keenly alive to a

sense of their responsibility and to the importance of their

functions.”   See Waller, 467 U.S. at 46 (internal citations
omitted).   Indeed, who better to perform that function for Bucci

than Mrs. Keefe and Mrs. Bucci?

     Moreover, disallowing public entry throughout the

empanelment was a reasonable exercise of the judge’s power to

ensure fairness and order during the proceedings because it

lessened the risk of intermingling between potential jurors and

the defendants’ close family members.       Judge Lindsay’s concern

regarding the inappropriate interaction between the venire and

                                   18
     Case 1:04-cr-10194-GAO Document 460 Filed 12/31/09 Page 19 of 27



spectators is implicit in the record, see Hr’g Tr. vol. 1 at 59,

and expressly exhibited by the judge’s admonition before the

lunch recess for counsel to ensure that the defendants’ families

did not mingle with venire members, Trial Tr. 31.11        As the

affidavits submitted by Bucci and the testimony at the

evidentiary hearing show, there were at least twenty-five of

Bucci and Jordan’s close family members and friends, waiting

around the entrance to the courtroom at various points throughout

the morning.   They included the defendants’ siblings, children,

aunt, uncles, cousins, nieces, and nephews.        See Bucci’s Pet.,
Ex. 7; Hr’g Tr. vol 2 at 14, 85-88, 98-99, 101-102.         Allowing

such a large number of close family members to sit in the

immediate proximity of the potential jurors would have increased

the risk of improper mingling.      In addition, as mentioned above,

allowing spectators immediately to take the seats of the excused

jurors in the first and second rows would block Judge Lindsay’s

and counsels’ view of the venirepersons next in line to fill the

jury box.   This would significantly diminish the benefit of Judge
Lindsay’s practice of seating jurors in the courtroom according

to the order they would be called to the jury box.         See supra
Part II.B.1.a., n.5.    Therefore, it was within Judge Lindsay’s




     11
       It appears Judge Lindsay’s concern was well-founded as
Mrs. Keefe testified that during the lunch recess, a venire
member indeed attempted to speak with her. To Mrs. Keefe’s
credit, she immediately told the potential juror that per the
judge’s instructions, she could not speak to him. Hr’g Tr., vol.
2 at 26.

                                   19
     Case 1:04-cr-10194-GAO Document 460 Filed 12/31/09 Page 20 of 27



discretion reasonably to limit access to the trial throughout the

morning.

     Furthermore, a record of the jury selection was made

available for public viewing after the proceeding, which cuts

against any air of secrecy.     This case is a far cry from that in

Waller, where no members of the public were admitted for a seven-

day suppression hearing, 467 U.S. at 48, or that in Owens, where

the First Circuit believed that all spectators were excluded from

the entire day of jury selection, 483 F.3d at 63.         There having

been no closure for the reasons stated above, this Court holds

that Bucci’s right to a public trial was not violated, and thus

he cannot prevail on this ground of his habeas petition.

           2.   Prosecutorial misconduct (Grounds Two and Three)

     Bucci alleges in Ground Two of his petition that his Due

Process rights were violated because the government failed to

make appropriate disclosure of favorable evidence as mandated by

Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).       Specifically, Bucci

claims that the government withheld an affidavit prepared by
Minotti (“Minotti Aff.”), Bucci’s Mem., Ex. 15 [Doc. No. 400, Ex.

1, Part 4 at 15], for Minotti’s sentencing hearing as well as

statements made by Minotti during his proffer sessions.          Bucci’s

Mem. 18.

     This issue was not raised during the direct appeal.          The

government argues that Bucci’s claim is procedurally barred

because he has failed to show cause and prejudice as required by

Frady, 456 U.S. at 167-68.

                                   20
     Case 1:04-cr-10194-GAO Document 460 Filed 12/31/09 Page 21 of 27



     Minotti’s Affidavit relates to the possibility that during

the set up narcotics transaction Ruiz carried a gun.          Minotti

stated that he told Jordan that Ruiz never had a gun.          Minotti

therefore never actually thought that Jordan would even consider

pulling his service weapon.     Minotti Aff. 4.     While this

statement is relevant to whether Minotti actually foresaw that

Jordan would carry a gun, it is irrelevant to whether Bucci

foresaw the same.    Minotti’s Affidavit is thus immaterial as to

Bucci’s guilt and punishment, and Bucci is unable to show that

the jury and sentencing judge’s lack of knowledge regarding the

conversation between Minotti and Jordan worked to Bucci’s actual

and substantial disadvantage.      No prejudice existed and this

Court’s inquiry need not go any further.12

     Moreover, in Ground Three, Bucci alleges various misconduct

by the prosecution.    He suggests that the government coerced

Minotti into pleading guilty to the gun charge pursuant to 18

U.S.C. § 924(c)(1), conducted direct examination in a manner that




     12
       It seems fair to note, however, that Bucci also fails to
show cause for his procedural default. Bucci explains that at
the time of his sentencing, he was not aware of the existence of
Minotti’s affidavit, Bucci’s Pet. 7, because it was sealed and
unavailable to his counsel. Bucci’s Mem. 15. An examination of
docket entries in United States v. Minotti, No. 04-10325 (D.
Mass.), shows the contrary. The affidavit was filed on July 11,
2006. [No. 04-10325, Doc. No. 66]. On the same day Minotti
moved to seal the Affidavit. [No. 04-10325, Doc. No. 67]. On
July 14, 2006, Judge O’Toole issued an electronic order denying
Minotti’s motion. The government correctly points out that on
that day the Affidavit became a part of public record and was
accessible to Bucci’s counsel. Gov.’s Mem. 23. Bucci fails to
show otherwise.

                                   21
     Case 1:04-cr-10194-GAO Document 460 Filed 12/31/09 Page 22 of 27



manipulated the truth, and failed to disclose evidence which

could impeach Minotti.

     Again, those claims were not brought up during the direct

appeal.   Bucci fails to show that any prejudice resulted.         Thus,

whether there was cause for Bucci’s procedural default need not

be analyzed.

            3.   Ineffective assistance of counsel (Grounds Four
                 and Five)

     When the underlying claim alleges ineffective assistance of

counsel the requirement of showing cause and prejudice for a

procedural default does not apply.       Smullen v. United States, 94

F.3d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 1996) (citing Knight v. United States, 37

F.3d 769, 774 (1st Cir. 1994)).      “Constitutionally ineffective

assistance of counsel constitutes cause sufficient to excuse a

procedural default.”    Prou v. United States, 199 F.3d 37, 47 (1st

Cir. 1999) (citing Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 488 (1986)).

To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a

defendant must demonstrate deficient performance of counsel and

prejudice resulting therefrom.      Strickland v. Washington, 466
U.S. 668, 687 (1984).    Such deficiency occurs when an attorney's

performance is “so inferior as to be objectively unreasonable.”

United States v. McGill, 11 F.3d 223, 226 (1st Cir. 1993).              The

Constitution guarantees a “fair trial and competent attorney,”

Engle v. Isaac, 456 U.S. 107, 134 (1982), and not a “successful

defense,” United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 309 (1st Cir.

1991).    An attorney’s assistance is ineffective where he fails to

“raise an important, obvious defense without any imaginable

                                   22
     Case 1:04-cr-10194-GAO Document 460 Filed 12/31/09 Page 23 of 27



strategic or tactical reasons for the omission.”         Prou, 199 F.3d

at 48.   To show the resultant prejudice, “[t]he defendant must

show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for

counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding

would have been different.     A reasonable probability is a

probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.”

Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694.

                a.    Witness issues at the trial

     In Ground Four, Bucci alleges that in the opening statement

his counsel promised the jury that he would present a witness

with an alibi defense, and that counsel then failed to call that

witness, undercutting the credibility of the defense.          Bucci’s

Mem. 77.

     The determination of whether a failure to produce a promised

witness constitutes ineffective assistance is necessarily fact-

based.   McGill, 11 F.3d at 227.     “[N]o particular set of rules

can be established to define effective assistance, as hard-and-

fast rules would inevitably restrict the independence and
latitude counsel must have in making tactical and strategic

decisions.”   Natanel, 938 F.2d at 310.
     The government contends that when the prosecution rested,

Bucci’s attorney made an offer of proof and the government did

not object.   Trial counsel sought a brief recess to confer with

his client.   After the recess, trial counsel said he would not be

calling any witnesses.     Gov.’s Mem. 39.    The government argues

that the decision not to call the alibi witness was strategic.


                                   23
     Case 1:04-cr-10194-GAO Document 460 Filed 12/31/09 Page 24 of 27



There is a “strong presumption that counsel’s conduct falls

within a wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that

is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the

circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound

trial strategy.”    Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689 (internal citation

omitted).   Here, Bucci has not carried his burden of proving that

the decision was not strategic.13

     Next, Bucci alleges that the fact his attorney previewed the

government’s cooperating witness whom the government ultimately

decided not to call amounted to ineffective assistance of

counsel.    Bucci, however, presents no evidence that trial counsel

knew or should have known that the government would not call that

witness.    The government points out that the prosecution only

decided in the middle of its case not to call the cooperating

witness, and that co-defendant’s counsel previewed the same

witness.

     Finally, Bucci contends that trial counsel rendered

deficient performance by failing to lay the foundation for and

     13
       Moreover, Bucci’s claim is easily distinguishable from
the First Circuit precedent finding ineffective assistance of
counsel when counsel failed to present evidence mentioned in an
opening. In Ouber v. Guarino, 293 F.3d 19, 27 (1st Cir. 2002),
the First Circuit held that a decision to not have the defendant
testify after promising his testimony in an opening was deficient
performance. The First Circuit has noted, however, that this
holding is limited to cases with “greater specificity in the
promise and greater contemporaneousness between the promise and
jury deliberations,” Yeboah-Sefah v. Ficco, 556 F.3d 53, 78 (1st
Cir. 2009) (quoting Phoenix v. Matesanz, 233 F.3d 77, 85 (1st
Cir. 2000)), than what transpired here. In Bucci’s case counsel
did not name the witness and the alibi was circumstantial in
nature. Further, the opening took place twenty days prior to
deliberations.

                                   24
     Case 1:04-cr-10194-GAO Document 460 Filed 12/31/09 Page 25 of 27



offer the testimony of another government witness’s brother, who

purportedly was willing to impeach the government witness’s

testimony.    The potential impeachment witness was called but was

excluded under Federal Rule of Evidence 403 (excluding relevant

evidence on grounds of prejudice, confusion, or waste of time).

The prosecution’s witness had already been cross-examined for

several days and the witness was deemed redundant by the court.

     Bucci is not able to show that his counsel’s performance was

so deficient that it deprived him of trial producing a fair

result.

                  b.   Ineffective assistance at the sentencing

     In Ground Five, Bucci claims that his counsel’s failure to

object to imposing on Bucci a consecutive term of 84 months on

Count 3 pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)14 was deficient

performance amounting to ineffective assistance of his counsel.

Bucci asserts that because his minimum mandatory sentence for

combined Counts 1 and 2 was ten years, the “except” clause




     14
          18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A) provides in relevant part:

             Except to the extent that a greater minimum
             sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection
             or by any other provision of law, any person who,
             during and in relation to any crime of violence or
             drug trafficking crime . . . uses or carries a
             firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime,
             possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the
             punishment provided for such crime of violence or
             drug trafficking crime -
               . . . (ii) if the firearm is brandished, be
             sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less
             than 7 years . . . .

                                   25
     Case 1:04-cr-10194-GAO Document 460 Filed 12/31/09 Page 26 of 27



applied to him, and the consecutive term ought not have been

imposed at all.   Bucci’s Mem. 84.

     Bucci is mistaken as to applicable precedent.         In United

States v. Parker, 549 F.3d 5 (1st Cir. 2008), Parker was subject

to a mandatory minimum ten-year sentence based on the drug

convictions and presented the very same argument Bucci does in

the instant case.    Parker, 549 F.3d at 11.      There, the First

Circuit stated, “[s]ection 924(c) dictates an additional minimum

sentence for an underlying offense because of the presence of the

firearm; thus, if ‘a greater minimum sentence is otherwise

provided’ on account of the firearm, then under the ‘except

clause’ that greater minimum might supercede the otherwise

applicable section 924(c) adjustment.”       Id. (emphasis in
original).   Moreover, the First Circuit distinguished the Second

Circuit case United States v. Whitley, 529 F.3d 150 (2d Cir.

2008) in which Whitley was subject to a fifteen-year mandatory

minimum sentence for possession of a firearm in the course of the

robbery.   The Parker court noted that in such circumstances,
imposing a consecutive sentence of ten years pursuant to 18

U.S.C. 924(c) would result in a double increment for “discharge

of the same gun in the same robbery” - the very situation the

Congress wanted to avoid by use of the “except” clause.          Parker,
549 F.3d at 11.

     Furthermore, in United States v. Pulido, 566 F.3d 52, 65,

n.6 (1st Cir. 2009) the First Circuit confirmed the validity of

Parker and rejected the reasoning of the Second Circuit in United

                                   26
     Case 1:04-cr-10194-GAO Document 460 Filed 12/31/09 Page 27 of 27



States v. Williams, 558 F.3d 166, 168 (2d Cir. 2009) which held

that the “except” clause was applicable “where the defendant is

subject to a longer mandatory minimum sentence for a drug

trafficking offense.”

     Bucci’s counsel’s failure to object to the imposition of the

consecutive term was not deficient performance and, therefore,

Bucci’s ineffective assistance claim fails.
III. CONCLUSION

     None of Bucci’s claims establish that a violation of the

federal constitution or laws occurred in his case.         Therefore,

Bucci’s petition is DENIED.     For all the same reasons, Jordan’s

petition is DENIED.



     SO ORDERED.
