                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

                         DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                   Criminal No. 07-cr-191-01-SM

Cirino Gonzalez


                                  O R D E R


     While it may be a debatable legal and ethical point, still,

I think recusal in this case is both warranted and appropriate,

given the close circumstantial relatedness between the charged

conspiracy and reported public statements by the Browns and

others associated with them over the past several months.

Because those public statements included threats of violence and

physical harm directed at me, a reasonable person, fully informed

of the facts, might understandably question my ability to remain

impartial in this case, were I to preside.           Strictly speaking,

the charges here do not include allegations of threats made

against me (which would unquestionably warrant recusal), but such

distinctions overlook practical realities.           While I have no doubt

about my own ability to be impartial, I think the public interest

is better served by my recusal and reassignment of this case to a

different judge to avoid the risk of even an appearance of

partiality.
