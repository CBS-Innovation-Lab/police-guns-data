                   UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND


UNITED STATES

     v.                                       CR. No. 11-06-ML

WAYNE SIMON



                       MEMORANDUM AND ORDER

     Petitioner Wayne Simon (“Simon”), proceeding pro se, has filed

a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to

28 U.S.C. § 2255, alleging that his Sixth Amendment Rights were

violated when his sentence was enhanced by six levels pursuant to

U.S.S.G. § 3A1.2(c)(1) for assaulting a police officer “in a manner

creating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury.” For the

reasons stated below, Simon’s motion is denied.

     I.   Background and Travel

     On January 19, 2011, Simon was indicted by a grand jury for

(Count I) being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of

18 U.S.C. §922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2); (Count II) possession with

intent to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. §841(a)(1)

and (b)(1)(C); (Count III) possession with intent to distribute

oxycodone in violation of 21 U.S.C. §841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C); and

(Count IV) possession with intent to distribute marijuana in

violation of 21 U.S.C. §841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(D). Indictment (Dkt.

No. 1).


                                  1
     On May 9, 2011, Simon, who had at least three prior felony

convictions on his record, pleaded guilty to all four counts of the

indictment. No plea agreement was entered in this case. According

to the evidence presented by the government (and admitted by Simon)

at the change of plea hearing, Simon was arrested following a

search of his residence in which detectives discovered 327 grams of

cocaine, 2,244 grams of marijuana, 353 oxycodone pills, and a

quantity of ecstasy and other pills. In addition to the drugs and

various drug paraphernalia, detectives also found three types of

ammunition and $29,100 in cash.

     Prior to Simon’s arrest on November 15, 2010, officers of the

North Smithfield Police Department had secured Simon’s residence to

await the arrival of detectives with a warrant. Simon arrived at

his residence and attempted to get by the officers and gain entry

to his house. When the officers tried to stop Simon, he violently

resisted, injuring at least two of the officers before Simon was

subdued. Change of Plea Transcript (Dkt. No. 30).

     Simon’s sentencing hearing took place on August 22, 2011.

Before sentencing Simon to 188 months’ imprisonment, the Court

conducted an evidentiary hearing to address the applicability of

U.S.S.G. § 3A1.2(c)(1) for Simon’s resistance to the arrest, in the

course of which an officer sustained a broken hand. Sentencing

Hearing Transcript (Dkt. No. 29). The Court concluded that the six-

level enhancement applied in this case. Based on his criminal


                                  2
history, Simon qualified as a Category VI career offender. Combined

with a total offense level of 31, Simon’s sentencing guideline

range fell between 188 and 235 months of incarceration. Upon the

government’s recommendation, the Court sentenced Simon at the

lowest end of the range.

     Subsequently, Simon appealed from his sentence on the sole

ground that the six-level sentencing enhancement was applied in

error. However, Simon did not challenge this Court’s finding that

when Simon raised a fist toward the police officers during a

violent struggle with officers trying to keep him from entering his

residence, that act qualified as an “assault” under U.S.S.G.

§3A1.2(c)(1). Accordingly, the First Circuit Court of Appeals

affirmed Simon’s sentence. Judgment (Dkt. No. 32).

     On April 1, 2013, the United States Supreme Court denied

Simon’s petition for writ of certiorari, rendering his conviction

final.

     II. Standard of Review

     Pursuant to Section 2255, “[a] prisoner in custody under

sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming the

right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed

in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or

that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or

that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law,

or is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may move the court


                                3
which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the

sentence.” 28 U.S.C. § 2255(a).

     Relief under Section 2255 is available only if the Court finds

a lack of jurisdiction, constitutional error, or a fundamental

error of law.   See United States v. Addonizio, 442 U.S. 178, 184-

84, 99 S.Ct. 2235, 60 L.Ed.2d 805     (1979) (holding that “an error

of law does not provide a basis for a collateral attack unless the

claimed error constituted a ‘fundamental defect which inherently

results in a complete miscarriage of justice.’”)(quoting Hill v.

United States, 368 U.S. 424, 428, 82 S.Ct. 468, 471, 7 L.Ed.2d 417

(1962)). A fundamental error of law is a defect “‘which inherently

results in a complete miscarriage of justice’ or ‘an omission

inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.’”

Knight v. United States, 37 F.3d 769, 772 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting

Hill v. United States, 368 U.S. at 428, 82 S.Ct. at 471)).

     III. Simon’s § 2255 Motion

     Simon’s § 2255 motion is based primarily on the 2013 Supreme

Court decision in Alleyne v. United States, — U.S. — , 133 S.Ct.

2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013). Specifically, Simon asserts that the

six-level enhancement for assault was imposed in violation of his

Sixth Amendment rights because the facts on which the enhancement

application was based were found not by a jury, but by the Court

under a preponderance of the evidence standard. As the reason why

he did not raise this issue on direct appeal, Simon refers to


                                  4
“[i]neffective   assistance   of   counsel,”   without   providing   any

further details and without addressing the issue in his supporting

memorandum, (Dkt. No. 33, pages 15-19). In his reply to the

government’s response, Simon suggests that his court-appointed

counsel should have filed a motion to suppress the evidence against

him on the grounds that the officers were on Simon’s property

without a warrant and instigated a physical altercation with Simon,

(Dkt. No. 35).

     The government’s objection to Simon’s motion is based on the

assertion that (1) Alleyne does not apply retroactively; and (2)

Alleyne does not apply to sentencing guidelines enhancements.

     IV. Discussion

     In Alleyne, the United States Supreme Court held that any fact

(other than a prior conviction) that increases a mandatory minimum

sentence constitutes an “element” of the crime, not a “sentencing

factor,” which “must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a

reasonable doubt” before an enhanced mandatory sentence may be

imposed. Alleyne, 133 S.Ct. at 2155.    The Supreme Court’s decision

in Alleyne applies to any case pending on direct appeal at the time

Alleyne was decided.” United States v. Pizarro, — F.3d —, 2014 WL

6090601 (1st Cir. Nov. 14, 2014); United States v. Delgado-Marrero,

744 F.3d 167 (1st Cir. 2014). However, there is nothing to indicate

in the Alleyne opinion that this principle is to be applied

retroactively. Simpson v. United States, 721 F.3d 875, 876 (7th


                                   5
Cir. 2013)(noting that Alleyne is an extension of Apprendi v. New

Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and

that the Supreme Court has decided that other rules based on

Apprendi do not apply retroactively on collateral review)(citing

Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 U.S. 348, 124 S.Ct. 2519, 159 L.Ed.2d 442

(2004)).

      On its face, the new rule imposed by Alleyne, as the one

imposed by Apprendi, is procedural, not substantive. To determine

whether a new procedural rule applies retroactively on collateral

review, the Supreme Court has established a three-part analysis,

including (1) whether the defendant’s conviction was final when the

new rule was announced; (2) whether the rule is in fact “new;” and

(3)   whether   that   new   rule   is       subject   to   one   of   two   narrow

exceptions allowing for retroactive application: (a) whether it

places “certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond

the power of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe,” or

(b) whether it rises to the level of a watershed rule of criminal

procedure. Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 306, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 1073,

103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989);

      Simon’s conviction became final on April 1, 2013, two months

prior to the decision in Alleyne (June 17, 2013). Therefore, any

rule established by Alleyne would benefit Simon only if the rule

were to be applied retroactively. Because the Alleyne rule does not

constitute a “watershed rule of criminal procedure,” United States


                                         6
v. Sanders, 247 F.3d 139, 151 (4th Cir. 2001), it does not apply

retroactively. Other courts that have addressed the question of

retroactive     application   of   Alleyne      have   come    to    the    same

conclusion. See e.g., United States v. Hoon, 762 F.3d 1172, 1173

(10th Cir.2014); Jeanty v. Warden, FCI–Miami, 757 F.3d 1283, 1285

(11th Cir.2014); In re Mazzio, 756 F.3d 487, 490 (6th Cir.2014);

United States v. Reyes, 755 F.3d 210, 212–13 (3d Cir.2014); United

States v. Redd, 735 F.3d 88, 92 (2d Cir.2013); In re Kemper, 735

F.3d 211, 212 (5th Cir.2013).

      Simon’s motion also fails because Alleyne is not applicable in

his particular case. As the Supreme Court pointed out, its ruling

in Alleyne “does not mean that any fact that influences judicial

discretion must be found by a jury.” Alleyne, 133 S.Ct. at 2163.

Rather,   the   Supreme   Court    has   long     recognized    that       “broad

sentencing discretion, informed by judicial factfinding, does not

violate the Sixth Amendment.” Id.        Therefore, “it remains within

the   sentencing   court's    discretion     to    judicially       find    facts

informing the sentence actually imposed, provided that any such

fact does not trigger a mandatory minimum punishment or alter a

statutory maximum, and that the ultimate sentence remains within

the range of penalties set forth in the statute of conviction.”

United States v. Doe, 741 F.3d 217, 234 (1st Cir. 2013). “In such

a situation, Alleyne does not apply, and the sentencing court may

continue to find facts based upon a preponderance of the evidence.”


                                     7
Id.

      In the instant case, Simon was subject to a twenty-year

maximum sentence; no mandatory minimum sentence applied to any of

the offenses of which he was convicted. Application of the six-

level increase under § 3A1.2(c)(1), while it increased Simon’s

sentencing guideline range significantly, did not result in the

imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence, nor did it raise the

imposed   sentence       above     the       statutory      maximum.      In   these

circumstances, Alleyne does not apply and Simon’s motion must be

denied.

      Simon’s    suggestion      that    the      imposition   of   the   six-level

sentencing enhancement was the result of the ineffective assistance

of his counsel requires no lengthy discussion. Simon admitted at

the change of plea hearing that he violently resisted the officers

when they prevented him from entering his residence and that he

injured at      least   two officers         in    the   scuffle.   Following the

evidentiary hearing, which preceded imposition of the sentence,

Simon’s counsel forcefully argued that Simon only resisted the

officers but that Simon’s conduct did not qualify as an assault

resulting in serious personal injury. Based on the uncontested

evidence and the injured officer’s testimony at the evidentiary

hearing, the Court disagreed with Simon’s characterization of the

circumstances of his arrest and imposed the six-level enhancement.

That determination was subsequently upheld by the First Circuit


                                         8
Court of Appeals.

V.   Conclusion

     For all of the foregoing reasons, Simon’s motion to vacate,

set aside, or correct his sentence is DENIED and DISMISSED.

                Ruling on Certificate of Appealability

     Pursuant    to   Rule   11(a)   of   the   Rules   Governing   §   2255

Proceedings for the United States District Courts, this Court

hereby finds that this case is not appropriate for the issuance of

a certificate of appealability because Simon has failed to make “a

substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right” as to

any claim, as required by 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).

     Simon is advised that any motion to reconsider this ruling

will not extend the time to file a notice of appeal in this matter.

See Rules Governing § 2255 Cases, Rule 11(a).



SO ORDERED.
