                      DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE

ordered that, as a condition of supervised release, pursuant to

42 U.S.C. § 14135a the defendant shall submit to DNA collection

while incarcerated in the Bureau of Prisons or at the direction

of the United States Probation Office.       Due to a clerical error,

however, that specific condition of supervised release was not

included in the Judgment dated February 25, 2013.         Thus,

intended to inform the parties of the intention of the

sentencing judge to issue an Amended Judgment that will include

the previously mentioned omitted condition of supervised

release.


     While no responsive pleading is required, the parties have

fourteen (14) days from the date of this notice to file a

pleading providing a factual or legal basis why the court should

not issue the contemplated corrective Amended Judgment.           Absent

cause shown by a party within this time period, the sentencing

judge will enter an Amended Judgment as indicated above.
