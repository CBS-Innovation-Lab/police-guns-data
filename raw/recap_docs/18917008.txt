                 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                       DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



Bruce J. Belton

     v.                                   Criminal No. 04-cr-192-JD

United States of America


                                  O R D E R


     Bruce J. Belton was convicted on charges of unlawful

possession of a firearm and possession with intent to distribute

methamphetamine.      Judgment was entered on May 21, 2007, and the

mandates of the First Circuit Court of Appeals were entered in

May of 2007.     Belton, proceeding pro se, has written a letter to

the court, in his criminal case, representing that the Supreme

Court denied his appeal on October 6, 2008, and asking for an

enlargement of time, for ninety days, to file a petition for
relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.         In support of the requested

enlargement of time, Belton represents that he lacks access or
has limited access to the prison law library and relies on

assistance from other inmates because of his poor health.
     Section 2255(f) provides a one-year period of limitation for

a motion for relief under § 2255.         The limitation period begins

on the latest of four specified times.          Although Belton’s letter

suggests that he may be attempting to fall within the limitation

period described in § 2255(f)(2), he has not provided evidentiary

support for his allegations that the prison is failing to provide

him with access to the court, through inadequate access to legal

materials.   In addition, a § 2255 proceeding is a civil action

that is separate from the underlying criminal case.



                                Conclusion

      Belton’s request for an enlargement of time is denied

without prejudice to him to file a motion for relief under § 2255

and to seek, with proper evidentiary support, a limitation period

provided under § 2255(f).



      SO ORDERED.
