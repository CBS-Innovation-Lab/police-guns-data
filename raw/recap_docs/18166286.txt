DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
CRlMINAL NO. 09-10293-NMG

V.

ROBERT ADAMS

MOTION TO CORRECT SENTENCE PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C. § 2255 AND
.IOHWSON V. UNITEP STA TES. 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015). AND MOTION TO STAY

Petitioner, Robert Adams, respectfully moves this Court to vacate and correct his
sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 and Johnson v. Um'fed States, 135 S. Ct. 2551,
2563 (2015). I-Ie further moves this Court for an order staying these proceedings until the
First Circuit rules on his pending application before the First Circuit for permission to tile
a second or successive § 2255 motion. See RobertAdams v. United States, No. 16-1657
(lst Cir.).l The First Circuit has not yet ruled on Adams’s application Should the
application be ruled upon favorably by the First Circuit, Adams Will then l`lle a
memorandum in support.

ln Johnson, the Supreme Court struck the residual clause of the Armed Career
Criminal Act (“ACCA”), see 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), as unconstitutionally vague.

In Welch v. Um`tea' States, 136 S. Ct. 1257 (2016), the Supreme Court held that the rule
announced in Johnson is substantive and therefore retroactive to cases on collateral

review.

 

1 Adams previously filed a § 2255 motion raising claims relating to misconduct at the William Hinton State
Laboratory. On August 12, 2004 Adams voluntarily filed an unopposed Motion to Dismiss the petition and
on August 15, 2004, this Court denied it. Petitioner filed his Application for Leave to File a Second or
Successive Motion Under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 in the First Circuit on May 24, 2016.
