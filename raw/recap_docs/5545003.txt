STATEMENT OF REASONS

VII COURT DETERMINATIONS OF RESTITUTION
A m Restitution Not Applicable.
B Total Arnount of Restitution:

C Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

1 m For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S,C. § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

2 m For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to anyl victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(B).
3 l:] For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under lS U.S.C. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh

the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(21)(1 )(B)(ii).

4 [:I Restitution is not ordered for other reasons (Explain.)

D [:l Partial restitution is ordered for these reasons ( 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)):

VIII ADDITIONAL FACTS JUSTIFYING THE SENTENCE IN THIS CASE (If applicable.)

THE COURT IMPOSED THE SEN'[`ENCE AFTER CONSIDERING ALL THE SURROUNDING CIRCUMSTANCES
AND THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT'S DETERMINATION AS TO THE ADVISORY GUIDELINE RANGE.
