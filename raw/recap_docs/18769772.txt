                      UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                   FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE




United States of America

     v.                                   Case No. 06-cr-25-01-PB

Brandon Deane



                                  O R D E R


     The defendant has moved to continue the April 4, 2006 trial

in the above case, citing the need for additional time to review

discovery and prepare a defense.         The government does not object

to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, in order to allow the parties additional time

to properly prepare for trial, the court will continue the trial

from April 4, 2006 to July 6, 2006.         In agreeing to continue the

trial, the court finds pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A)

that for the above-stated reasons, the ends of justice served in

granting a continuance outweigh the best interests of the public

and the defendant in a speedy trial.
