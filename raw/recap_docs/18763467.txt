                      UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                           DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

                v.                               Criminal No. 05-cr-268-01-PB

Hugh Reynolds



       The defendant has moved to continue the February 7, 2006 trial in the above

case. Defendant cites the need for additional time to effectively prepare for trial. The

government does not object to a continuance of the trial date.

       Accordingly, in order to allow the parties additional time to negotiate a plea

agreement, or properly prepare for trial, the court will continue the trial from February

7, 2006 to May 2, 2006. In agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the ends of justice served in

granting a continuance outweigh the best interests of the public and the defendant in a

speedy trial.
