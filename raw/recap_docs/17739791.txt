            ORDER AFFIRMING THE RECOMMENDED DECISION OF
                       THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE

       The Court denies James Damon’s 28 U.S.C. § 2255 petition (1) because he is

 procedurally defaulted from asserting the claim, (2) because the United States

 Supreme Court case of Johnson v. United States, 130 S. Ct. 1265 (2010) and the

 First Circuit case of United States v. Holloway, 630 F.3d 252 (1st Cir. 2011) are not

 retroactive, (3) because his claim of legal as opposed to factual innocence is not

 cognizable in a § 2255 petition, (4) because a miscalculation of a guideline sentence

 range that results in a sentence within the correct statutory range is not a complete

 miscarriage of justice, and (5) because a sentence of seventy months for this

 Defendant does not represent in any event a complete miscarriage of justice. The

 Court affirms the Magistrate Judge’s Recommended Decision. However, because a

 reasonable jurist could disagree with this ruling, the Court grants Mr. Damon’s

 request for a certificate of appealability.

 I.    PROCEDURAL HISTORY

       A.     The Facts

       On October 11, 2007, James Damon approached Katrina Wickett and asked

 her to purchase a gun for him at Frati’s Pawn Shop in Bangor, Maine. Prosecution

 Version at 1. (ECF No. 79). Convicted in Massachusetts of an assault and battery

 felony in 2006, Mr. Damon could not buy the gun on his own. See id. Instead, Mr.

 Damon gave Ms. Wickett money to buy the gun, entered Frati’s with her and with

 two of his male associates, and hand-selected a Springfield Armory .45 caliber pistol

 for her to purchase. United States v. Damon, 595 F.3d 395, 398 (1st Cir 2010);

 Prosecution Version at 1. Video surveillance from the pawnshop showed Mr. Damon

 handling at least three guns, including the Springfield Armory .45 caliber pistol.

 Damon, 595 F.3d at 398.      Ms. Wickett filled out the requisite paperwork and

 purchased the gun for him. Id.; Prosecution Version at 1.

       After the sale, the pawnbroker became suspicious of the transaction and

 asked Ms. Wickett to return in forty-five minutes so that he could resolve a

 paperwork issue. Damon, 595 F.3d at 398. The pawnbroker contacted a Task Force

 officer at the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives who came to

 the Pawn Shop to conduct surveillance.       Id.   When Ms. Wickett returned, the

 pawnbroker handed her the guns, which prompted a discussion between the Task

 Force officer and Ms. Wickett. Id. Shortly thereafter, Ms. Wickett turned the guns

 over to the officer and explained how Mr. Damon and his two associates arranged

 for her to buy the guns for them. Id. On August 13, 2008, a federal grand jury



                                          2
Case 1:08-cr-00157-JAW Document 338 Filed 12/13/12 Page 3 of 32        PageID #: 2004



 charged Mr. Damon with three firearms offenses and he was arrested on August 15,

 2008. Id; Indictment (ECF No. 3).

       The five-count Indictment against Mr. Damon contained three counts: Count

 One―conspiracy to make false statements in acquisition of firearms in violation of

 18 U.S.C. § 371 and § 922(a)(6); Count Two―aiding and abetting the making of false

 statements in the acquisition of firearms in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(a)(6); and

 Count Five―possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).

 Indictment. On December 1, 2008, Mr. Damon pleaded guilty to Count 5 pursuant

 to a written plea agreement, and at his sentencing, pursuant to that agreement, the

 Government moved to dismiss Counts One and Two. Plea Agreement at 4 (ECF No.

 67). The Court granted the motion. J. (ECF No. 207).

       B.    Mr. Damon’s Sentencing

       In the Presentence Report (PSR), the Probation Office addressed Mr.

 Damon’s criminal history.    PSR at 7-13.     The Probation Office calculated his

 criminal history score at nine and determined that he fell into Criminal History

 Category IV.    Id. ¶ 33.   Included in this calculation was a January 12, 2006

 conviction in the Massachusetts District Court for assault and battery. Id. ¶ 30. In

 determining Mr. Damon’s base offense level under the Guidelines, the Probation

 Office referenced both this assault and battery conviction and a drug trafficking

 conviction and determined that Mr. Damon’s base offense level was twenty-four

 because he had at least two felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a

 controlled substance offense.   Id. ¶ 12; see U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(a)(2) (“24, if the



                                          3
Case 1:08-cr-00157-JAW Document 338 Filed 12/13/12 Page 4 of 32          PageID #: 2005



 defendant committed any part of the instant offense subsequent to sustaining at

 least two felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance

 offense”).

        On April 3, 2009, Mr. Damon filed a sentencing memorandum in which he

 opposed two sentencing enhancements that the Probation Office had recommended

 in the PSR: (1) a two-level increase for the number of firearms attributable to him

 under U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(1), and (2) the inclusion of a drug trafficking offense as

 one of the predicate offenses for the base offense level of twenty-four. Def.’s Mem. in

 Aid of Sentencing at 1-9 (ECF No. 171). Mr. Damon did not contest the inclusion of

 the assault and battery conviction as a crime of violence under § 2K2.1(a)(2). See

 id.; Mem. in Support of 2255 Pet. at 3 (ECF No. 300) (“Mr. Damon did not challenge

 the use of his prior Assault and Battery conviction as a qualifying prior crime of

 violence in establishing the base offense level”) (Def.’s Mem.). The Government

 maintained that both enhancements were warranted and recommended a sentence

 at the higher end of the Guidelines range of seventy to eighty-seven months. Gov’t’s

 Mem. in Aid of Sentencing at 1-5, 7-9 (ECF No. 174). In calculating Mr. Damon’s

 final offense level, the PSR started with a base offense level of twenty-four, added

 two levels for the number of firearms, and reduced that number by three levels for

 acceptance of responsibility to a final offense level of twenty-three. PSR ¶ 12-21.

 On May 12, 2009, after rejecting Mr. Damon’s two sentencing objections, the Court

 sentenced Mr. Damon to seventy months imprisonment on Count Five, three years

 of supervised release, and a special assessment of $100. J. (ECF No. 207). On May



                                           4
Case 1:08-cr-00157-JAW Document 338 Filed 12/13/12 Page 5 of 32          PageID #: 2006



 13, 2009, Mr. Damon appealed his sentence to the First Circuit Court of Appeals.

 Notice of Appeal (ECF No. 208). On appeal, Mr. Damon did not raise any issues

 regarding the assault and battery conviction and on February 18, 2010, the First

 Circuit affirmed the sentence. See Damon, 595 F.3d at 397; J. on Appeal (ECF No.

 251).

          C.    Mr. Damon’s Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct his
                Sentence

                1.    Mr. Damon’s Motion

          On February 14, 2011, Mr. Damon moved to vacate, set aside, or correct his

 sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Mot. under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 to Vacate, Set

 Aside, or Correct Sentence by a Person in Federal Custody (ECF No. 289) (Def.’s

 Mot.).    On March 15, 2011, Mr. Damon filed a memorandum in support of his

 petition, Def.’s Mem., and on August 22, 2011 a supplemental memorandum. Supp.

 Mem. in Support of 2255 Pet. (ECF No. 322) (Def.’s Supp. Mem.).           Mr. Damon

 contends that United States v. Holloway, 630 F.3d 252 (1st Cir. 2011), a case that

 followed the United States Supreme Court’s decision in Johnson v. United States,

 130 S. Ct. 1265 (2010), requires a recalculation of his base offense level. Def.’s Mem.

 at 5-10. He contends that under Holloway an assault and battery conviction under

 this Massachusetts statute for an offensive and reckless battery is categorically not

 a crime of violence, as opposed to harmful battery, which is. Def.’s Mem. at 5-10.

 He says that the Government can establish only the fact of the assault and battery

 conviction, but not the level of intent involved and therefore, under Holloway his

 2006 assault and battery conviction should not have counted as a crime of violence.

                                           5
Case 1:08-cr-00157-JAW Document 338 Filed 12/13/12 Page 6 of 32                  PageID #: 2007



 Id. at 4-5. Mr. Damon maintains that his base offense level should have started at

 twenty, not twenty-four. Id. at 4-5. He contends that with a two-level increase for

 the number of firearms and a three-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility,

 the total offense level should have been nineteen and the resulting sentencing

 guideline range should have been forty-six to fifty-seven months, not seventy to

 eighty-seven months. Id.

           In support of his motion, Mr. Damon insists that under Teague v. Lane, 489

 U.S. 288 (1989), the rule announced in Holloway is substantive rather than

 procedural and should be applied retroactively. Id. at 5-6. Mr. Damon supports his

 retroactivity argument with United States v. Narvaez, 674 F.3d 621 (7th Cir. 2011),1

 in which the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the United States

 Supreme Court’s decisions in Begay v. United States, 553 U.S. 137 (2008) and

 Chambers v. United States, 555 U.S. 122 (2009) were retroactive. Def.’s Supp. Mem.

 at 1-2.

           Mr. Damon recognizes that “‘sentencing errors are generally not cognizable

 on collateral review’” but argues that his case, and cases such as Naravez, present

 “‘a special and very narrow exception: [a] post-conviction change in the law has

 rendered the sentencing court’s decision unlawful.’” Id. at 2 (quoting Narvaez, 674

 F.3d at 627). Under Holloway, Mr. Damon states “the First Circuit has shifted

 [him] from one category of violent offender to another category of non-violent

 offender based on the same document [(his Massachusetts’ criminal complaint)]”

 1       The Seventh Circuit original opinion in Narvaez, 641 F.3d 877 (7th Cir. 2011) was
 withdrawn and replaced by the opinion found at 674 F.3d 621 (7th Cir. 2011). The Court has cited
 the later version.

                                                6
Case 1:08-cr-00157-JAW Document 338 Filed 12/13/12 Page 7 of 32           PageID #: 2008



 and therefore he is no longer subject to the enhancement and should be resentenced

 for the “understandable, but mistaken, impression that [he] had two countable prior

 convictions.” Def.’s Mem. at 7; Def.’s Supp. Mem. at 4. Furthermore, Mr. Damon

 asserts that he did not default on this claim because it was unavailable to him at

 the time of his sentencing and appeal. Def.’s Mem. at 8. He says, that “it appears

 that [he] is [now] ‘actually innocent’ of the sentence imposed and thus may be

 excused for not having raised this issue in his direct appeal.” Id. at 10.

              2.     The Government’s Motion for Summary Dismissal

       In response to Mr. Damon’s motion, on September 20, 2011, the Government

 moved the Court for summary dismissal of Mr. Damon’s § 2255 motion. Gov’t Mot.

 for Summ. Dismissal of Mot. to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence Pursuant to

 28 U.S.C. § 2255 and Supporting Mem. of Law (ECF No. 327) (Gov’t’s Mot.).          The

 Government first argues that there is little, if any, authority to support Mr.

 Damon’s contention that Holloway and Johnson should be applied retroactively. Id.

 at 20. In addition, the Government highlights a series of decisions from various

 federal courts to emphasize that courts are divided on retroactive application of new

 precedent in § 2255 petitions. Id. at 21-22.

       Second, the Government contends that Mr. Damon’s claim is procedurally

 barred because he did not challenge the inclusion of the assault and battery

 conviction in his PSR, at the time of his sentencing, or on appeal.          Id. at 22.

 Although Holloway and Johnson were decided after Mr. Damon’s sentencing and

 appeal, the Government points out that his current claim was reasonably available



                                            7
Case 1:08-cr-00157-JAW Document 338 Filed 12/13/12 Page 8 of 32         PageID #: 2009



 to him at the time of his sentencing and appeal given significant legal revisions to

 the term “violent felony” at that time. Id. at 23. Third, the Government argues

 that even if Holloway is retroactively applied and his claim is not procedurally

 barred, Mr. Damon cannot demonstrate that upholding his seventy-month sentence

 would result in a miscarriage of justice, a statutorily illegal sentence, or

 constitutional violation. Id. at 24-25. Finally, in the event of a resentencing, the

 Government alerts the Court that it will seek an upward departure or variance

 from any reduced Guideline range. Id. at 25.

              3.     Mr. Damon’s Reply

       On October 20, 2011, Mr. Damon replied. Petitioner’s Opp’n to Gov’t Mot. for

 Summ. Dismissal (ECF No. 331) (Def.’s Reply). First, Mr. Damon asserts that the

 Government failed to demonstrate that Johnson and Holloway may not be applied

 retroactively to his case given that Mr. Damon is not limited by a waiver, that his §

 2255 petition was timely, and that Johnson and Holloway fit within a class of cases

 generally given retroactive effect. Id. at 1-3. Next, Mr. Damon admits that he

 procedurally defaulted on his claim but argues that there are exceptions to the

 procedural default rule, which allow the Court to provide him a remedy. Id. at 4.

 Citing the Seventh Circuit’s decision in Narvaez, Mr. Damon also argues that the

 “miscarriage of justice” exception applies to his case because the Court

 misapprehended the nature of his criminal history, which could result in a due

 process violation if not corrected. Id. at 6.

 II.   THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE’S RECOMMENDED DECISION

       A.     The Recommended Decision

       The United States Magistrate Judge filed a Recommended Decision on

 November 21, 2011. Recommended Decision on 28 U.S.C. § 2255 Mot. (ECF No.

 332) (Rec. Dec.).    The Magistrate Judge recommended that the Court grant the

 Government’s motion for summary dismissal of Mr. Damon’s 28 U.S.C. § 2255

 motion, unless it concluded that a “miscarriage of justice” had occurred. Id. at 14.

 After summarizing the inter-circuit disagreement regarding the retroactivity of new

 precedent on collateral review, the Magistrate Judge tentatively recommended that

 Johnson and Holloway “could theoretically be applied retroactively to a non-time

 barred, first-time § 2255 petition and that even a procedurally defaulted defendant

 can, in the right circumstances, mount a challenge of ‘actual innocence’ to a

 sentencing enhancement in the context of a § 2255 petition.” Id. at 12. Even so, she

 recommended that Mr. Damon not prevail on his § 2255 petition because he did not

 show that the sentencing error in his case was either statutorily illegal or

 unconstitutional. Id.

       The Magistrate Judge distinguished Narvaez on the ground that Mr. Damon

 is not challenging a mandatory sentencing enhancement “but rather a two-year

 difference between the high-end of the base-offense level 20 and the low-end of base-

 offense level 24.”    Id. at 13.   Notably, the Magistrate Judge pointed out that

 whether this sentencing difference constitutes a “miscarriage of justice” must be

 analyzed in light of the Court’s discretion to impose the same sentence at



                                           9
Case 1:08-cr-00157-JAW Document 338 Filed 12/13/12 Page 10 of 32       PageID #: 2011



 resentencing if it accepts the Government’s argument for an upward departure or

 variance under the current sentencing guidelines. Id. Although the Magistrate

 Judge acknowledged that “given the current state of the law, a reasonable jurist

 could conclude that Damon’s procedural default of the Holloway issue could be

 excused in these circumstances and his ‘actual innocence’ regarding the sentence

 enhancement could form the basis of a resentencing order,” she determined that no

 caselaw confirms this position. Id. at 14. In the end, she concluded that “[Mr.]

 Damon’s case does not present the factual matrix that would warrant this Court’s

 entry of such an order” unless his sentence was based upon assumptions concerning

 his criminal history which were materially untrue in the sense of Townsend v.

 Burke, 334 U.S. 736 (1948), such that his sentence amounted to a “miscarriage of

 justice.” Id.

           B.     Mr. Damon’s Objection

           On December 8, 2011, Mr. Damon objected to the Magistrate Judge’s

 Recommended Decision.         Objs. to Recommended Decision (ECF No. 333) (Def.’s

 Objs.).        Mr. Damon insists that his guideline calculation was “erroneously

 calculated” and that, if properly calculated, his sentencing range would have been

 forty-six to fifty-seven months, not seventy to eighty-seven months. Id. at 5. Mr.

 Damon argues that the method by which his sentence was calculated establishes

 that his “‘sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the

 United States . . . .’” Id. (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2255(a)). Recognizing that circuit

 courts have come to different conclusions at to whether a Guideline error is



                                           10
Case 1:08-cr-00157-JAW Document 338 Filed 12/13/12 Page 11 of 32         PageID #: 2012



 cognizable in a § 2255 proceeding, Mr. Damon asserts that although the First

 Circuit has not directly addressed this issue “it appears from the cases decided in

 the First Circuit that it would join the Seventh Circuit’s analysis in Narvaez.” Id.

 at 6. Finally, citing Townsend v. Burke, 334 U.S. 736 (1948), and United States v.

 Curran, 926 F.2d 59 (1st Cir. 1991), Mr. Damon asserts that he was sentenced upon

 information that was “materially incorrect” in light of Holloway and that this error

 implicates substantive due process. Id.

 III.   DISCUSSION

        A.    United States v. Turner

        On June 28, 2011, a district court in the District of Massachusetts issued a

 decision that touched on the impact of Johnson on Massachusetts convictions for

 assault and battery for purposes of Armed Career Criminal status. United States v.

 Turner, 793 F. Supp. 2d 495, 508-11 (D. Mass. 2011). The defendant appealed that

 order to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit and, as it appeared that the First

 Circuit might address Johnson’s retroactivity, this Court waited for the First

 Circuit’s Turner decision before addressing Mr. Damon’s objection to the

 Recommended Decision.

        On November 13, 2012, the First Circuit issued Turner. Turner v. United

 States, Nos. 11-1884, 11-1885, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 23319 (1st Cir. Nov. 13, 2012).

 As it turned out, the First Circuit ruled without reaching the retroactivity issue.

 The Turner Court carefully reviewed the defendant’s arguments and concluded

 that, when he was before the district court, the defendant had failed to “raise this



                                           11
Case 1:08-cr-00157-JAW Document 338 Filed 12/13/12 Page 12 of 32                    PageID #: 2013



 independent Johnson theory and the claim is forfeited.” Id. at *20. In closing, the

 Circuit Court commented:

        Although we have no occasion to decide the Johnson issue, it may be
        useful to emphasize that the analysis of such a clam is by no means
        straightforward. The Supreme Court has not yet held that Johnson is
        retroactive and the government has independently argued that the
        claim is procedurally defaulted. This is not a case in which the
        application of time limits threatens any obvious injustice.

 Id. at *23-24.

        B.      United States v. Narvaez and Other Caselaw

        On June 3, 2011, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued a

 decision that addressed an analogous issue: whether two United States Supreme

 Court decisions, Begay v. United States, 553 U.S. 137 (2008) and Chambers v.

 United States, 555 U.S. 122 (2009), which redefined “violent felony” for purposes of

 the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), should be applied retroactively on

 collateral review. Narvaez, 674 F.3d at 625. The Seventh Circuit discussed the

 Supreme Court’s rules on retroactivity under Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989)

 and noting that retroactivity depended upon whether a new rule is procedural or

 substantive, the Narvaez Court observed that the new rule substantially narrowed

 a defendant’s exposure to a sentence of imprisonment and that such an increase in

 punishment “‘is certainly a substantive liability.’”2 Id. at 626 (quoting Welch v.

 United States, 604 F.3d 408 (7th Cir. 2010)). The Seventh Circuit held that “the

 Begay and Chambers decisions apply retroactively on collateral review.” Id. at 625.

 2      In Teague, the Supreme Court also observed that a “watershed” change in a rule of criminal
 procedure could have retroactive effect. Teague, 489 U.S. at 311; see Whorton v. Bockting, 549 U.S.
 406, 416 (2007). However, Mr. Damon does not claim that if Johnson announced a procedural, not a
 substantive rule, that it should be considered a watershed rule. See Def.’s Mem. at 5-6.

                                                 12
Case 1:08-cr-00157-JAW Document 338 Filed 12/13/12 Page 13 of 32              PageID #: 2014



        In United States v. Coley, the Eleventh Circuit reached a different conclusion.

 United States v. Coley, 336 F. Appx. 933 (11th Cir. 2009). The Coley Court noted

 that in Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. 465 (1976), the United States Supreme Court

 wrote that “‘28 U.S.C. § 2255 will not be allowed to do service for an appeal . . . . For

 this reason, nonconstitutional claims that could have been raised on appeal, but

 were not, may not be asserted in collateral proceedings.’” Coley, 336 F. Appx. at 935

 (quoting Stone, 428 U.S. at 478 n.10).        The Coley Court did not view Begay as

 addressing a constitutional issue, only an interpretation of the application of a

 Sentencing Guideline provision. Id. at 936. Furthermore, the Eleventh Circuit

 observed that if the defendant believed his career offender status was improper

 under the guidelines “that claim could have been made on direct appeal—just as

 Begay and Archer later did.”3 Id. The Coley Court affirmed the denial of the § 2255

 petition “[b]ecause his status as a career offender is a non-constitutional issue that

 Coley could have raised on direct appeal” and therefore “it is not cognizable on

 collateral review under § 2255.” Id.

        Other than Narvaez and Coley, there is limited caselaw as to whether Begay

 and Chambers should be applied retroactively.          In July 2012, the Sixth Circuit

 addressed a defendant who had received an enhanced sentence under the ACCA

 that he could not have statutorily received for his original crime. Kirk v. United

 States, No. 11-3337, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 15822, at *2 (6th Cir. Jul. 27, 2012)

 (addressing defendant sentenced to 190 months under the ACCA and the

 applying Begay. See United States v. Archer, 531 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir. 2008).

 unenhanced statutory maximum was 120 months).              In Kirk, the Government

 conceded on appeal that the defendant had only two qualifying ACCA predicates

 and urged the appellate court to remand the case for the imposition of a non-

 enhanced sentence. Id. The Sixth Circuit had little difficulty concluding that the

 erroneous classification represented a miscarriage of justice and that relief under 28

 U.S.C. § 2255 was appropriate, effectively applying Begay retroactively. See id.

       C.     Caselaw After Johnson

       As the First Circuit pointed out in Turner, the Supreme Court “has not yet

 held that Johnson is retroactive.” Turner, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 23319, at *23-24.

 Whether Johnson is retroactive is more complicated than whether Begay and

 Chambers are retroactive―in part because Begay and Chambers were decided before

 Johnson, it is more difficult to argue that Johnson announced new law.

       Although not cited by the parties, the Court has located two circuit cases in

 which the Government conceded that Johnson is retroactive. In Rozier v. United

 States, No. 11-13557, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 24129 (11th Cir. Nov. 21, 2012), the

 Circuit wrote that “[t]he government concedes, and we take it as a given, that the

 Supreme Court’s Johnson decision is retroactively applicable.” Id. at *8.          In

 Meirovitz v. United States, 688 F.3d 369 (8th Cir. 2012), Judge Bright noted in

 concurrence that “the government concedes that Johnson states a new rule with

 retroactive effect.” Id. at 372.

       The Government cites the opinions of several district courts that have ruled

 Johnson is not retroactive.        In Crawford v. United States, Nos. 8:11-cv-1866-T-



                                             14
Case 1:08-cr-00157-JAW Document 338 Filed 12/13/12 Page 15 of 32         PageID #: 2016



 30TGW, 8:07-cr-454-T-30TGW, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94291 (M.D. Fl. Aug. 23,

 2011), a district court concluded that the contention that Johnson is retroactive

 “lacks merit.” Id. at *5. Judge Moody noted that “Johnson includes no statement

 from the Supreme Court that the decision applies retroactively to cases on collateral

 review” and he noted that “[n]o binding Eleventh Circuit decision requires

 retroactive application of Johnson to Petitioner’s section 2255 motion.” Id.

 Although helpful, the Court notes that the district court in Crawford was

 addressing whether the petitioner’s motion was timely under 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f)(3),

 which provides that the one-year period of limitation applies from “the date on

 which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right

 has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable

 to cases on collateral review.” Id. at *4 (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f)). The Crawford

 Court directed its analysis to whether the petitioner had met this difficult statutory

 hurdle, and here, Mr. Damon filed his § 2255 petition while his direct appeal was

 still pending so § 2255(f)(3) does not apply. Other district courts have split on the

 issue of retroactivity. Compare Brackett v. United States, Nos. 3:11-cv-30, 3:08-cr-

 56-2, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78883, at *21-22 (N.D. W.Va. Apr. 16, 2012)

 (concluding that Johnson did not announce new law and was not retroactive), with

 Reese v. Haynes, No. CV211-001, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93996, at *7 n.3 (S.D. Ga.

 Jun. 27, 2011) (concluding that Johnson is retroactive).

       D.     New or Old Law and Procedural Default

       Mr. Damon concedes that because he failed to advance the pending issue on

 direct appeal, he is subject to procedural default. Def.’s Reply at 4 (“He does not

 dispute that he procedurally defaulted this claim. He also maintains that there are

 exceptions to the procedural default rule that would allow this Court to provide him

 a remedy”). The Supreme Court has explained that the procedural default rule “is

 neither a statutory nor a constitutional requirement, but it is a doctrine adhered to

 by the courts to conserve judicial resources and to respect the law’s important

 interest in the finality of judgments.” Massaro v. United States, 538 U.S. 500, 504

 (2003). To avoid procedural default, Mr. Damon must demonstrate either cause for

 the waiver and actual prejudice, Reed v. Farley, 512 U.S. 339, 354 (1994), or a

 constitutional violation that has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is

 actually innocent. Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 496 (1986).

       “When a decision of [the Supreme] Court results in a ‘new rule,’ that rule

 applies to all criminal cases still pending under direct review.”          Schiro v.

 Summerlin, 542 U.S. 348, 351 (2004). “As to convictions that are already final,

 however, the rule applies only in limited circumstances.” Id. “New substantive

 rules generally apply retroactively. . . . New rules of procedure, on the other hand,

 generally do not apply retroactively.” Id. at 351-52 (emphasis in original).   In the

 context of a § 2255 petition, “new” means something specific. In Bousley v. United

 States, 523 U.S. 614 (1998), the Supreme Court required that to be new a claim




                                          16
Case 1:08-cr-00157-JAW Document 338 Filed 12/13/12 Page 17 of 32           PageID #: 2018



 must be “‘so novel that its legal basis is not reasonably available to counsel.’” Id. at

 622 (quoting Reed v. Ross, 468 U.S. 1, 16 (1984)).

       Applying this definition, the Court concludes that Johnson does not fit in the

 “new” category. The Court sentenced Mr. Damon on May 9, 2009. It is true that

 the Supreme Court decided Johnson on March 2, 2010 after Mr. Damon’s

 sentencing and appeal were final and at that time the controlling precedent in the

 First Circuit was that a conviction for assault and battery under Massachusetts law

 was a predicate conviction for a crime of violence under the United States

 Sentencing Guidelines. See United States v. Estevez, 419 F.3d 77, 82 (1st Cir. 2005);

 United States v. Santos, 363 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir. 2004); Untied States v. Mangos,

 134 F.3d 460, 464 (1st Cir. 1998). However, in Johnson, the Supreme Court applied

 the same modified categorical analytic approach it announced in Taylor v. United

 States, 495 U.S. 575 (1990) and reiterated in Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13

 (2005), an approach that by 2009 was fully integrated into the law. Johnson, 130 S.

 Ct. at 1273. In fact, in United States v. Giggey, 551 F.3d 27 (1st Cir. 2008), before

 Mr. Damon was sentenced, the First Circuit issued an en banc decision in which it

 applied the modified categorical analysis in Taylor, Shepard, and Begay to whether

 a Massachusetts conviction for burglary constituted a crime of violence under the

 career offender provision. Id. at 38-41. It is a short analytic step to apply the

 Giggey analysis of the Massachusetts burglary statute to the Massachusetts assault

 and battery statute.




                                           17
Case 1:08-cr-00157-JAW Document 338 Filed 12/13/12 Page 18 of 32        PageID #: 2019



       From the Court’s perspective, the Taylor/Shepard line of cases, which had

 been made applicable to an analogous Massachusetts criminal statute, presented an

 obvious argument that should have been raised at Mr. Damon’s sentencing. As the

 First Circuit recently wrote, “[a]llowing the defendant to raise a new argument in a

 habeas petition when he could (and should) have raised it either at his original

 sentencing or on direct review or both would undermine the prudential goals of the

 law of the case doctrine.” United States v. Matthews, 643 F.3d 9, 15 (1st Cir. 2011).

 The Court concludes that Mr. Damon’s Johnson claim is procedurally defaulted.

       E.      “Actual Innocence” and Procedural Default

       Even if he could have and should have raised the Johnson issue at sentencing

 or direct appeal, the law’s bar bends if Mr. Damon demonstrates “a constitutional

 violation [that] has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually

 innocent.” Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 496 (1986). In his motion, Mr. Damon

 asserts that the Court should allow the § 2255 petition because he is “actually

 innocent” of the sentence enhancement that was imposed. Def.’s Mem. at 9. In

 support, he cites a Fourth Circuit case, United States v. Maybeck, 23 F.3d 888 (4th

 Cir. 1993), in which the appellate court held:

       Except for the obvious difference in the severity of the sentences, we
       see little difference between holding that a defendant can be innocent
       of the acts required to enhance a sentence in a death case and applying
       a parallel rationale in non-capital cases. . . . a defendant in either a
       capital or noncapital case would, unless excepted from the cause and
       prejudice requirement suffer the same general consequence (an
       enhanced sentence) from being held responsible for an act of which he
       or she is actually innocent.

 Id. at 893.

                                           18
Case 1:08-cr-00157-JAW Document 338 Filed 12/13/12 Page 19 of 32          PageID #: 2020



       Despite Maybeck, it is by no means clear that the actual innocence of a

 sentence enhancement applies to a non-capital case.          The First Circuit has not

 spoken on this issue and other circuits are split. Spence v. Superintendent, Great

 Meadow Corr. Facility, 219 F.3d 162, 171 (2d Cir. 2000) (holding that the actual

 innocence applies to a sentencing enhancement in a non-capital sentence); Embrey

 v. Hershberger, 131 F.3d 739, 740 (8th Cir. 1997) (en banc) (concluding that the

 actual innocence sentencing exception applies “only to the sentencing phase of death

 cases”); United States v. Richards, 5 F.3d 1369, 1371 (10th Cir. 1993) (“A person

 cannot be actually innocent of a noncapital sentence . . . .”).

       To resolve this issue, the Court need not decide whether the actual innocence

 exception applies to generic non-capital sentences. As the Eleventh Circuit pointed

 out in McKay v. United States, 657 F.3d 1190 (11th Cir. 2011), for this purpose the

 Supreme Court defines the term “‘actual innocence’” as “‘factual innocence, not mere

 legal insufficiency.’” Id. at 1197 (quoting Bousley, 523 U.S. at 623). “[F]or the

 actual innocence exception to apply in the noncapital sentencing context, a movant

 must show that he is factually innocent of the conduct or the underlying crime that

 serves as the predicate for the enhanced sentence.” Id. at 1198-99.

       Here, Mr. Damon makes no claim that he is factually innocent of the

 underlying crime of assault and battery. See Def.’s Mem. at 7. According to the

 PSR, he pleaded guilty to the charge on January 12, 2006 and there is no suggestion

 he was not validly convicted. PSR ¶ 30. Instead, he maintains that even though he

 assaulted his mother, this Court should not have considered this conviction as a



                                            19
Case 1:08-cr-00157-JAW Document 338 Filed 12/13/12 Page 20 of 32        PageID #: 2021



 career offender predicate because he could have perpetrated only an “offensive

 touching[],” not a “harmful battery.” See Holloway, 630 F.3d at 260; Def.’s Mem. at

 5-7.

        To sustain an “actual innocence” claim in a capital context, however, a

 petitioner “must show by clear and convincing evidence that, but for a constitutional

 error, no reasonable juror would have found [him] eligible for the death penalty.”

 Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U.S. 333, 336 (1992).   The Court assumes that, if it applies

 at all, the standard for an actual innocence claim in a non-capital sentencing

 enhancement would be no stricter than for a capital enhancement.          Here, Mr.

 Damon’s contention that he is actually innocent of an assault and battery that

 would qualify as a career offender predicate is solely based on an asserted legal

 insufficiency, not on actual factual innocence of the enhancement. Def.’s Mem. at 7

 (“Here, the challenge Mr. Damon makes is not to the specific facts of his prior

 conviction, which cannot be taken into account in determining whether his prior

 conviction qualifies as an enhancing predicate. Rather it is an entire category of

 defendants that the First Circuit has declared to not fall within the range of those

 considered to be crimes of violence”) (emphasis in Defendant’s memorandum).

        In other words, on collateral review, a defendant—like Mr. Damon—who

 wishes to challenge a sentencing enhancement as a miscarriage of justice must do

 more than simply put the Government to its proof. In Bousley, the United States

 Supreme Court noted that in this context “‘actual innocence’ means factual

 innocence, not mere legal insufficiency.” Bousley, 523 U.S. at 624; Gaskins v. Duval,



                                          20
Case 1:08-cr-00157-JAW Document 338 Filed 12/13/12 Page 21 of 32          PageID #: 2022



 640 F.3d 443, 444 (1st Cir. 2011). As the Eleventh Circuit pointed out, even in the

 Second and Fourth Circuits, a “claim of mere legal innocence of a sentence would

 not win the day in either of those circuits.” McKay, 657 F.3d at 1199.

       Here, Mr. Damon concedes that he “finds himself in the unenviable position

 of having denied that he used violence in the commission of the prior A&B

 conviction in Massachusetts.” Def.’s Objection at 4. He never says that he did not

 grab his mother by the throat and push her against the wall, which is what the PSR

 says he did. PSR ¶ 30. In fact, the police report expands the description of Mr.

 Damon’s actions, revealing that his mother told the police that after getting in a

 verbal argument with her, Mr. Damon became physically violent, grabbed her by

 the throat, pushed her up against a wall, continually pushed her, while screaming

 at her that he was “untouchable.” Gov’t’s Mot. Attach. 1 at 3 (Brockton Police Dep’t

 Report Dec. 8, 2005). The police officer observed Mr. Damon’s mother’s neck to be

 red and discolored and he requested an arrest warrant issued for Mr. Damon. Id.

       Mr. Damon is not so unwise as to represent to the Court that he did not do

 what is stated in the police report. Instead, he asserts that whether he actually did

 so does not matter. Def.’s Objs. at 4-5. In the context of a § 2255 challenge to a

 sentencing enhancement, however, it does matter.          As the Eleventh Circuit

 observed in McKay, “[n]o circuit court has held that the actual innocence exception

 is available for claims of purely legal innocence.” McKay, 657 F.3d at 1999.

       If actual innocence applies to his non-capital sentencing enhancement, the

 Court concludes that Mr. Damon has not demonstrated that he is actually innocent



                                          21
Case 1:08-cr-00157-JAW Document 338 Filed 12/13/12 Page 22 of 32         PageID #: 2023



 of the sentencing enhancement under United States Sentencing Guideline §

 2K2.1(a)(2).

       F.       Complete Miscarriage of Justice

       To prevail on the § 2255 petition, Mr. Damon must demonstrate that his

 sentence “‘(1) was imposed in violation of the Constitution, or (2) was imposed by a

 court that lacked jurisdiction, or (3) exceeded the statutory maximum, or (4) was

 otherwise subject to collateral attack.’” Moreno-Morales v. United States, 334 F.3d

 140, 148 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting David v. United States, 134 F.3d 470, 474 (1st Cir.

 1998)). As Mr. Damon does not argue that this Court lacked jurisdiction or that his

 sentence exceeded a statutory maximum, he is left with a claim that his sentence is

 unconstitutional or is “otherwise subject to collateral attack.” See id. Mr. Damon’s

 constitutional and collateral attack arguments are two sides of the same coin: that

 he is actually innocent of the sentencing enhancement. See Def.’s Opp’n at 4-8.

       The constitutional attack is self-explanatory.     Turning to the “otherwise

 subject” standard, under Hill v. United States, 368 U.S. 424 (1962), to prevail on his

 demand for collateral review, Mr. Damon must demonstrate “a fundamental defect

 which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice” or “an omission

 inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.” Id. at 428; Knight v.

 United States, 37 F.3d 769, 772 (1st Cir. 1994). As the First Circuit has stressed, to

 meet this standard, the petitioner must not only establish error but also the error

 must “‘present exceptional circumstances where the need for the remedy afforded by

 the writ of habeas corpus is apparent’” and “[e]rrors warranting a reversal on direct



                                          22
Case 1:08-cr-00157-JAW Document 338 Filed 12/13/12 Page 23 of 32                    PageID #: 2024



 appeal will not necessarily support a collateral attack.” Knight, 37 F.3d at 772

 (quoting Bowen v. Johnston, 306 U.S. 19, 27 (1939)).

        Turning to Mr. Damon’s argument, citing Holloway, he contends that the

 Government is unable to demonstrate, using a categorical approach, that the

 January 12, 2006 Massachusetts conviction for assault and battery is a crime of

 violence under United States Sentencing Guideline § 2K2.1(a)(2).                   In Holloway,

 even after Johnson, the First Circuit did not reverse the district court sentence;

 rather, it vacated the sentence and remanded to the sentencing court for

 resentencing. Holloway, 630 F.3d at 262. Noting that the Government had not

 presented Shepard evidence at the original sentencing, the First Circuit acceded to

 the Government’s request that it be allowed to present such evidence at a

 resentencing.4     Id.   In this case, the Government has not suggested that if a

 resentencing were held, it could produce Shepard documents that would clarify

 whether Mr. Damon’s assault and battery was harmful as opposed to reckless or

 offensive or would fit within the residual clause. See Giggey, 551 F.3d at 40-41

 (applying the categorical approach to U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2(a)’s residual clause). In fact,

 the Government attached to its memorandum a sealed exhibit consisting of the

 Brockton Police Department report of the incident, an exhibit that would not meet

 Shepard standards. Gov’t’s Mem. Attach. 1.

 4      In Giggey, quoting Shepard, the First Circuit described the permissible documents under
 Shepard: “For guilty pleas, the federal sentencing court may review the ‘charging document, written
 plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to
 which the defendant assented.’” Giggey, 551 F.3d at 40 n.8 (quoting Shepard, 544 U.S. at 16). Mr.
 Damon was charged and pleaded guilty to assault and battery in the busy state district court in
 Brockton, Massachusetts. PSR ¶ 30. It would be surprising if any of the Shepard-sanctioned
 documents existed for this criminal case and, as the Court has noted, the Government has not
 suggested they do.

                                                 23
Case 1:08-cr-00157-JAW Document 338 Filed 12/13/12 Page 24 of 32           PageID #: 2025



       Even if the Government could not establish that Mr. Damon’s assault and

 battery was a crime of violence for purposes of United States Sentencing Guideline

 § 2K2.1(a) and § 4B1.2, the next question is whether this error resulted in a

 “complete miscarriage of justice.” In Narvaez, the Seventh Circuit readily concluded

 that a misapplication of the career offender guideline which resulted in a Guideline

 range of 151 to 188 months as opposed to 100 to 125 months and a sentence of 170

 months constituted a “complete miscarriage of justice.” Narvaez, 674 F.3d at 624,

 628-29. The Seventh Circuit observed:

       The imposition of the career offender status branded Mr. Narvaez as a
       malefactor deserving of far greater punishment than that usually
       meted out for an otherwise similarly situated individual who had
       committed the same offense. It created a legal presumption that he
       was to be treated differently from other offenders because he belonged
       in a special category reserved for the violent and incorrigible.

 Id. at 629. Similarly, in Torres-Rosario, the First Circuit determined that it would

 be a miscarriage of justice on direct appeal to uphold the defendant’s 240-month

 sentence and ACCA designation post-Holloway because Holloway would likely

 result in a lower sentence of 110-137 months. 658 F.3d at 116, 116 n.3.

       The issue is much closer here. Categorizing the January 12, 2006 conviction

 as a crime of violence did not result in Mr. Damon’s categorization as a career

 criminal. It did result in an enhanced sentencing range of seventy to eighty-seven

 months as opposed to forty-six to fifty-seven months. Once that Guideline range

 was established, the Court treated the range as advisory and sentenced Mr. Damon

 to seventy months in accordance with 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) factors, among which are

 the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need to deter criminal conduct,

                                          24
Case 1:08-cr-00157-JAW Document 338 Filed 12/13/12 Page 25 of 32           PageID #: 2026



 and to protect the public from future crimes of the defendant.            18 U.S.C. §

 3553(a)(1), (2)(B)(C).

       Significantly, if Mr. Damon were resentenced, the Court would apply the

 same analysis. Once the new Guideline range was established, the Court would

 start with the Guideline range and then turn to the § 3553(a) factors. During this

 phase of the sentencing hearing, the Government would not be restricted to

 Shepard documents to prove the facts underlying Mr. Damon’s assault and battery

 conviction, and the police report would likely be admissible for this purpose. See

 United States v. Figaro, 935 F.2d 4, 8 (1st Cir. 1991) (“[u]nlike the strict evidentiary

 restrictions applicable at trial, the only evidentiary requirement at sentencing is

 that the sentence be based on information which has ‘sufficient indicia of reliability

 to support its accuracy’”) (quoting U.S.S.G. § 6A1.3); see also United States v.

 Marsh, 561 F.3d 81, 88-87 (1st Cir. 2009) (affirming the district court judge’s

 reliance on police reports to establish the facts underlying the defendant’s vacated

 resisting arrest convictions during its 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(C) assessment). If so,

 the conduct underlying Mr. Damon’s assault and battery, namely pushing his

 mother against a wall and choking her, would likely be before the Court for its §

 3553(a) consideration.

       To place this assault and battery into perspective for Mr. Damon, his

 January 12, 2006 conviction was the fourth conviction for assaulting his mother.

 On February 15, 2000, when he was fourteen, he pushed his mother against a wall

 and threw a hat in her face, resulting in a conviction on April 10, 2000. PSR ¶ 22.



                                           25
Case 1:08-cr-00157-JAW Document 338 Filed 12/13/12 Page 26 of 32          PageID #: 2027



 On December 3, 2001, when he was fifteen, he committed two assaults against his

 mother, one in which he grabbed her by the shoulder and raised his hand to her and

 the other in which he pushed her. PSR ¶¶ 27-28.

          Mr. Damon’s criminal history was not limited to periodic assaults against his

 mother. As a juvenile, he had been also adjudicated for another assault, a breaking

 and entering, a criminal threatening, and, as an adult, in addition to the January

 12, 2006 assault and battery conviction, he had a conviction for possession with the

 intent to distribute marijuana. PSR ¶¶ 23-25, 29. Only twenty-three years old, Mr.

 Damon had an unusual number of dismissed charges: eleven charges had been

 dismissed, including eight assault and batteries or criminal threatening. PSR ¶¶

 34-43.     One of those dismissed charges involved a criminal threatening of his

 mother. PSR ¶ 38.

          Furthermore, at the time of sentencing, Mr. Damon was subject to eight

 pending criminal charges in Massachusetts, including (1) distribution of crack

 cocaine, (2) drug violation near a school or park, (3) conspiracy to violate drug law,

 (4) trespassing, (5) assault and battery, (6) aggravated assault and battery, assault

 and battery with a dangerous weapon, and conspiracy, (7) assault and battery with

 a dangerous weapon, and (8) assault and battery. PSR ¶¶ 46-53. The last charge

 also is alleged to have involved his mother as the victim; the PSR states that he

 punched his mother in her stomach, groin and head. PSR ¶ 53.

          If Mr. Damon’s January 12, 2006 conviction had not placed him in base

 offense level twenty-four and, after upward and downward adjustments, a resulting

 Guideline range of seventy to eighty-seven months, the Court may well have sua

 sponte considered whether his criminal history category of IV substantially

 underrepresented the seriousness of his criminal history and his likelihood of

 recidivism. See U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3(a)(1). An upward adjustment of only one criminal

 history category would have resulted in Mr. Damon’s placement in a Guideline

 range of forty-one to seventy-one months and an adjustment of two criminal history

 categories a range of sixty-three to seventy-eight months.     Unlike Narvaez and

 Torres-Rosario, where it was uncontested that the miscalculation substantially

 spiked the defendant’s Guideline sentence, the Court’s miscalculation of Mr.

 Damon’s range had the counterintuitive effect of mollifying its serious concerns

 about his criminal history and in view of his Criminal History Category IV, the

 Court did not consider an upward adjustment of his criminal history.

       Furthermore, there is no evidence that the Court sentenced Mr. Damon based

 on materially false or incorrect information as described in Townsend, United States

 v. Gonzalez-Castillo, and United States v. Curran. Townsend, 334 U.S. at 740-41

 (reversing the district court’s denial of a defendant’s § 2255 petition because the

 court “sentenced [the defendant] on the basis of assumptions concerning his

 criminal record which were materially untrue”―namely three larceny and theft

 charges dismissed as against the defendant); Gonzalez-Castillo, 562 F.3d 80, 82-84

 (1st Cir. 2009) (vacating a defendant’s 71-month sentence at the top of the guideline

 range for violating 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a)(2) because the district court based the

 defendant’s deterrent sentence on the “non-existent material fact” that he illegally



                                          27
Case 1:08-cr-00157-JAW Document 338 Filed 12/13/12 Page 28 of 32         PageID #: 2029



 entered the United States two times in a two year period); Curran, 926 F.2d 59, 60-

 61, 64 (1st Cir. 1991) (vacating the defendant’s sentence after learning that the

 sentencing judge imposed a higher sentence than recommended by the Government

 based upon letters from third parties, which were undisclosed to counsel until

 sentencing, urging him to impose a harsh sentence on the defendant).

          Unlike Townsend, Gonzalez-Castillo, and Curran, Mr. Damon has provided

 no evidence that the description of the maternal assault in the PSR and police

 report is materially false or inaccurate. It is true that at the sentencing hearing,

 through counsel, he cryptically objected to the description of the 2005 assault and

 battery, not the fact of the conviction itself.    Sentencing Tr. 16:17-25.     As a

 consequence of his objection and without further proof at the sentencing hearing,

 the Court considered only the fact of conviction, not the circumstances underlying it.

 The Court therefore imposed a sentence at the bottom of the sentencing guideline

 range.

          By contrast to a sentencing hearing, where the Government bears the burden

 to demonstrate the accuracy of contested matters, Mr. Damon’s § 2255 petition

 places him in a different position.      In this proceeding, Mr. Damon has not

 illuminated the Court as to what is inaccurate about the police report’s description

 of the 2005 maternal assault. If Mr. Damon presented the Court with his affidavit

 containing a different version of the assault and battery, sworn statements of

 witnesses disputing the PSR’s version, or other evidence that the description is

 false, it would be another matter.     But there is no suggestion in Mr. Damon’s



                                          28
Case 1:08-cr-00157-JAW Document 338 Filed 12/13/12 Page 29 of 32         PageID #: 2030



 pending petition that the actual facts underlying the 2005 maternal assault are

 false, only that he has a legal defense to how the conviction should be considered for

 guideline purposes. Moreover, even if the Court were to assume that the facts

 underlying the 2005 maternal assault are inaccurate, the fact remains that Mr.

 Damon at age twenty was convicted of assaulting and battering his own mother, his

 third such juvenile or adult conviction for doing so.

       The Court cannot know what sentence it would impose if Mr. Damon were to

 reappear for resentencing. In the unusual circumstances of this case, Mr. Damon’s

 criminal history confirmed an unusual streak of violent criminality, including

 multiple assaults against his mother, and the Court concludes that a sentence of

 seventy months, even though based on a miscalculation of the Guidelines, does not

 amount to a complete miscarriage of justice.

 IV.   SUMMARY

       The Court reviewed and considered the Magistrate Judge’s Recommended

 Decision, together with the entire record, and has made a de novo determination of

 all matters adjudicated therein.      In that regard, the Court concurs with the

 recommendations of the Magistrate Judge in her Recommended Decision and for

 the additional reasons herein, the Court determines that no additional proceeding is

 necessary. In sum, the Court concludes that Mr. Damon is procedurally defaulted

 from asserting this claim because he could and should have raised it either before

 this Court or on direct appeal, that Mr. Damon has failed to demonstrate that he is

 actually innocent of having previously committed a crime of violence under U.S.S.G.

 § 2K2.1(a)(2), and that his sentence of seventy months does not represent a

 complete miscarriage of justice.

 V.    CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY

       Under 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(1)(B), the Court of Appeals may review a final

 order in a proceeding under § 2255 if a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of

 appealability (COA). See 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c). “To obtain a COA under § 2253(c), a

 habeas prisoner must make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional

 right . . .” See Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 483-84 (2000). The petitioner’s

 burden to demonstrate suitability for a certificate depends on whether the district

 court dismissed the petitioner’s § 2255 claim on the merits or procedural grounds.

 Id. at 484.

       First, where a district court has rejected a petitioner’s constitutional claim on

 the merits, a certificate should only be issued if the petitioner can “demonstrate

 that reasonable jurists would find the district court’s assessment of the

 constitutional claims debatable or wrong.” Id.; see Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S.

 322, 338 (2003).    If, on the other hand, the Court denies a defendant’s § 2255

 petition on procedural grounds, a certificate should be issued as long as the

 petitioner shows “(1) the soundness of the procedural ruling is debatable, and (2)

 the constitutional claim is also colorable.” Mateo v. United States, 310 F.3d 39, 40

 (1st Cir. 2002); see Slack, 529 U.S. at 484. The Slack Court observed that “[w]here

 a plain procedural bar is present and the district court is correct to invoke it to

 dispose of the case, a reasonable jurist could not conclude either that the district



                                           30
Case 1:08-cr-00157-JAW Document 338 Filed 12/13/12 Page 31 of 32           PageID #: 2032



 court erred in dismissing the petition or that the petitioner should be allowed to

 proceed further.” Slack, 529 U.S. at 484.

       Here, a “plain” procedural bar is not present. Instead, in this Court’s view,

 Mr. Damon has raised five issues that merit consideration by the First Circuit: (1)

 whether Mr. Damon’s claims are procedurally defaulted; (2) whether Johnson

 applies retroactively; (3) whether a guideline miscalculation that results in a

 sentence within the proper statutory range satisfies the complete miscarriage of

 justice standard; (4) whether a claim of actual innocence may be based on a legal as

 opposed the factual error; and (5) whether in the circumstances of this case a

 seventy-month sentence represents a complete miscarriage of justice.             Under

 Mateo’s two-factor test, (1) reasonable jurists could debate the Court’s procedural

 rulings in this case and (2) reasonable jurists could decide that issues (1)-(5) present

 colorable constitutional claims given that the outcome of these issues implicates due

 process concerns. See 310 F.3d at 40. Like the district court judge in United States

 v. Narvaez, Nos. 09-cv-222-bbc, 03-cr-81-jcs, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67189 (W.D.

 Wis. July 31, 2009), although the Court believes it is “proper to deny [Mr. Damon’s]

 § 2255 motion, [it] cannot say that a reasonable judge would not make a different

 decision.” Id. at *3. The Court grants Mr. Damon’s certificate of appealability.

 VI.   CONCLUSION

       1.     It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the
              Magistrate Judge (ECF No. 332) be and hereby is AFFIRMED.

       2.     It is further ORDERED that James Damon’s Motion to Vacate,
              Set Aside, or Correct Sentence (ECF No. 289) be and hereby is
              DENIED.
