                          UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                       FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

        v.                                         Case No. 11-cr-41-PB

Claudio Silva



                                     O R D E R


        The defendant has moved through counsel to continue the

December 6, 2011 trial in the above case, citing newly appointed

counsel and the need for additional time to prepare for trial.

The government does not object to a continuance of the trial

date.

        Although it was previously ordered that no further

continuances would be allowed in this case, the court will

continue the trial from December 6, 2011 to February 7, 2012 in

order to grant new counsel sufficient time to properly prepare

for trial.        In agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds

pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ' 3161(h)(7)(A) that for the above-stated

reasons, the ends of justice served in granting a continuance

outweigh the best interests of the public and the defendant in a

speedy trial.

      The court will hold a final pretrial conference on January

31, 2012 at 4:00 p.m.     No further continuances.

      SO ORDERED.
