            0() to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct (18 US,c. § 3553(a)(2)(B»
            0() to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant (18 USc. § 3553(a)(2)(C»
            o    to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner
                 (18 V .S,c. § 3553(a)(2)(0»

            ~ to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants (18 U,Sc. § 3553(aX6»

            o    to provide restitution to any victims of the offense (18 U.S,C, § 3553(a)(7»


      D	    Explain the facts justifying a sentence outside the advisory guideline system. (UseSection VIII if necessary.)

             The sentence proposed by the guidelines overstates the seriousness and circumstances of this offense . The defendant's two
             prior controlled substance offenses for possession with intent to distribute relatively small quantities of marijuana amount to
             a combined total of just three criminal history points. At the same time, these two offenses increase the defendant's Base
             Offense Level by lO Levels under the guidelines. The guidelines sentencing range based on this signficantly increased
             Base Offense Level overstates the seriousness of this offense and does not properly reflect the nature and circwnstances of
             the offense.
             Sentencing the defendant within the range proposed by the guidelines would invite unwarranted sentencing disparities
             among similarly situated defendants , Other individuals convicted of this offense, and previously convicted of far more
             significant controlled substance offenses and/or violent felonies would receive the same guidelines sentencing range as this
             defendant. 1ndividuals convicted of possessing 200 additional firearms would also receive the same recommended
             guidelines sentence as this defendant. 1n order to avoid such unwarranted disparities the court has considered the
             defendant's two prior possession with intent to distribute marijuana convictions only with regard to the defendant's criminal
             history.
             The defendant lacks formal educational and vocational training , A sentence that provides these opportunities will protect
             the public from further crimes of the defendant.
