                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE




United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 06-cr-79-01-PB

Dorothy Collins, et al.


                                  O R D E R


     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

January 9, 2007 trial in the above case, citing the need for

additional time as defendant is currently ill and unable to

proceed with a plea hearing or trial.          The government does not

object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reason and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial or a plea hearing,

the court will continue the trial from January 9, 2007 to

February 6, 2007.       In agreeing to continue the trial, the court

finds pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-

stated reasons, the ends of justice served in granting a

continuance outweigh the best interests of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial.
