                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 12-cr-17-PB

Derek Kucinski


                                  O R D E R


     Defendant has moved through counsel to continue the trial

scheduled for June 5, 2012, citing newly appointed counsel and the

need for additional time to prepare for trial or engage in plea

negotiations.      The government does not object to a continuance of

the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reason and to allow time for the

parties to properly prepare for trial, the court will continue the

trial from June 5, 2012 to September 5, 2012.       In agreeing to continue

the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ' 3161(h)(7)(A)

that for the above-stated reasons, the ends of justice served in

granting a continuance outweigh the best interests of the public

and the defendant in a speedy trial.
