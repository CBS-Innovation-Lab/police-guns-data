JEFFREY PAUL BARNARD                   )


                         ORDER ON MOTION TO SEAL

      Jeffrey Paul Barnard is scheduled to be sentenced on January 4, 2017. In

anticipation of his sentencing hearing, Mr. Barnard filed two sentencing memoranda.

Mem. of Law in Aid of Sentencing and Resp. and Opp’n to Gov’t’s Mem. in Aid of

Sentencing; Mot. for Upward Departure; and Req. for Variant Sentence (ECF No. 258);

Mot. for a Variant Sentence (ECF No. 260). Mr. Barnard filed the first memorandum

without a motion to seal; he filed the second one under seal because the second

memorandum addresses his psychological condition and personal background.

Unopposed Mot. to File Under Seal Def.’s Mot. for Variant Sentence (ECF No. 259).

According to the motion to seal, the Government does not object to the second

memorandum remaining under seal.           Id. at 2.   The Court placed the second

memorandum under seal at least temporarily.

      In 2013, the First Circuit issued United States v. Kravetz, 706 F.3d 47 (1st Cir.

2013) in which it discussed the circumstances under which information that a

defendant (or the Government) urges a sentencing court to consider in reaching its

sentencing decision may be placed under seal.          The Kravetz Court made two

observations about medical or psychological records.        First, the First Circuit
Case 1:14-cr-00088-JAW Document 264 Filed 12/14/16 Page 2 of 3           PageID #: 1359



acknowledged that some of the sentencing letters described the defendant’s “difficult

upbringing and serious medical condition.” Id. at 57. The First Circuit cited two

cases, United States v. Dare, 568 F. Supp. 2d 242, 244 (N.D.N.Y. 2008) and United

States v. Sattar, 471 F. Supp. 2d 380, 385 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) in which courts concluded

that medical records and a psychiatric report were subject to public access. Kravetz,

706 F.3d at 58.

      At the same time, the Kravetz Court also recognized that medical information

is “universally presumed to be private, not public.” Id. at 63 (In re Boston Herald, 321

F.3d 174, 190 (1st Cir. 2003)). Even so, the First Circuit pointed out that “[t]he

privacy interest in medical information is ‘neither fundamental nor absolute,” id.

(Sattar, 471 F. Supp. 2d at 387), and that it “can be waived or otherwise overcome by

a variety of means.”     Id.   The First Circuit distinguished between medical or

psychological information that is “peripheral” and would only serve to “gratify private

spite or promote public scandal” and information that is “necessary to the public’s

appreciation of the sentence imposed.” Id. at 63.

      Here, Mr. Barnard appears to be leaning heavily on his psychological condition

as a primary basis for his argument for leniency. Furthermore, Mr. Barnard’s crime

was the type of crime that could generate public interest and concern because it

involved what the Government says was a stand-off between Mr. Barnard and law

enforcement. In light of these factors, the Court is concerned that the wholesale

sealing of Mr. Barnard’s psychological condition arguments would prevent the public

from understanding why the Court imposed a more lenient sentence or alternatively



                                           2
Case 1:14-cr-00088-JAW Document 264 Filed 12/14/16 Page 3 of 3            PageID #: 1360



why the Court rejected those arguments in favor of a harsher sentence. A public

sentencing is not a private matter. If Mr. Barnard is going to press the Court to

reduce his sentence based on his psychological issues, the Court’s overriding view is

that the public has a right to know why the Court imposed the sentence that it did.

      Accordingly, the Court will defer final ruling on the Defendant’s motion to seal

in order to allow the Defendant to reevaluate what portions, if any, must be sealed in

light of Kravetz and to allow the Government to explain why it acquiesced in the

Defendant’s request that matters essential to sentencing be hidden from the public.

The Court ORDERS the Government and the Defendant to file memoranda within

seven days of the date of this Order as to their respective positions in light of Kravtez.

      SO ORDERED.
