Re: United States of America v.
Javon Wooten
In United States District Court
Case No. 05-10205-NG

Dear Judge Gertner:
l am writing with regards to the above case matter.

The reason for this letter, is that l was charged and
convicted before this Honorable Court in violation of federal
drug laws. Subsequently, I was sentenced to lig months. l remain
incarcerated.

Judge Gertner, notably, in my "PSI" it reflects pararaph 60,
61, 62 that the listed charges were consolidated for sentencing
and therefore are treated as related. The sentences for these
offenses were imposed on the same day (12/12/01).

Here in this case, the "PSI" is incorrectly scored pursuant
the most recent change effective November 1, 2007 whereas it states
in part: "that were consolidated for sentencing and therefore are
treated as related".

Finally, with the new 709 amendment the record supports that
there is some confusion and-gas been a significant amount of
litigation with this issue. lt appears, based on the consolidation
of these sentences and the aggregate sentence being (2) years, the
criminal history points were excessive of (4) points or more.

Last, I am requesting pursuant to §3582(c)(2) that this
Honorable Court revise my "PSI" in accordance to the most recent
change by the National Sentencing Commission and or allow me a
hearing to determine the facts.

Accordingly, I await this Honorable Court's reply.
