                                    ORDER

WILLIAM E. SMITH, United States District Judge.

      Before this Court is Alejandro R. Pujols-Tineo’s Motion to

Vacate, Set Aside or Correct Sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255

(CR No. 05-137, EFC #174).          In his Motion, Pujols-Tineo asserts

claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and a claim challenging

the jurisdiction of this Court over his offenses.            The Government

has objected to the Motion on a single basis: that the motion was

untimely filed.      The Objection does not address Pujols-Tineo’s

substantive    §   2255   claims.       Pujols-Tineo   has   filed   a   Reply1

responding to the timeliness issue, and this Order focuses on that

issue.

       See “‘Traverse’/Response to the Government’s ‘Objection’ to
Motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255" (CR No. 05-137, EFC #183 (“Reply”).)
Case 1:05-cr-00137-S-LDA Document 198 Filed 07/30/10 Page 2 of 4 PageID #: 845



      Pujols-Tineo    pled   guilty   to   two   drug   offenses2   and    was

sentenced to 216 months imprisonment.        His conviction and sentence

were affirmed on appeal on October 30, 2007.              He did not seek

further review, and his conviction became final 90 days thereafter,

on January 28, 2008.         Accordingly, Pujols-Tineo’s deadline for

filing a motion under § 2255 was January 28, 2009.              28 U.S.C. §

2255(f).    See Clay v United States, 537 U.S. 522, 532 (2003) (§

2255's one-year limitation period starts to run when the time for

filing a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court expires).

      The instant Motion to Vacate was signed and dated by Pujols-

Tineo on September 18, 2008.          From a review of the papers, it

appears that the motion was placed into the prison mail system on

September 19, 2008, and was addressed to “United States Dist. Court

Clerk” at 50 Kennedy Plaza, Providence, RI -- the street address of

the Office of United States Attorney rather than this Court.              (See

copy of Certified Mail Receipt, Ex. 1 to Reply.)               Two separate

Certified Mail slips to be returned to Pujols-Tineo were each


      2
       The offenses were: (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to
distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C.
§§ 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B) and 846; and (2) possession with intent to
distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C.
§§ 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B). Pujols-Tineo also pled guilty to a
separate charge of illegal reentry in violation of 8 U.S.C. §§
1326(a) and (b)(2) and was sentenced to 216 months in prison, to
run concurrently with his drug offense sentence. (See CR No. 06-
025-S.) All plea and sentencing proceedings were conducted before
Judge Ernest C. Torres of this Court, and sometime after the
convictions were affirmed, this case was re-assigned to the
undersigned.    Further discussion of these proceedings is not
necessary in this Order.

addressed to: Adi Goldstein, AUSA, 50 Kennedy Plaza, Providence, RI

02903.   (Id.)   One of the slips was signed by “Paulette E. Gamache”

and is stamped with September 26, 2008, as the date of receipt.

The other slip was signed by “K. Lancaster”; the date of delivery

on that slip cannot be seen completely on the copy provided.              The

docket of this Court shows that Pujols-Tineo’s Motion to Vacate was

filed in this Court almost six months later on March 18, 2009 –

approximately one and one half months after the expiration of the

one-year limitation period.

      Based on this, the Government requests in its Objection that

the Motion to Vacate be dismissed as untimely filed. The Objection

only addresses the six-month lapse in time between the signing of

the motion and its filing in this Court in a footnote, stating that

“it is unlikely that it took six months for the mail to be

delivered from Pennsylvania to the District of Rhode Island.”

(Objection at 5, n.1.)        No mention is made in the Government’s

Objection of the apparent receipt by the United States Attorney’s

office of Pujols-Tineo’s Motion to Vacate in September 2008.

      This Court concludes that more information is needed to

determine whether Pujols-Tineo’s Motion to Vacate was timely filed

-- which, in turn, will govern whether this Court must address his

substantive § 2255 claims.

      Accordingly, this Court ORDERS as follows:

      (1)   The Government shall file a supplemental memorandum on or

            before August 27, 2010, which shall address: (1) what

            actions, if any, the Government took after receiving

            Pujols-Tineo’s Motion to Vacate in September 2008; (2)

            the   issue   of   whether       a   motion   to   vacate   which   was

            addressed to and received by the prosecutor’s office

            rather than the court can be deemed filed for purposes of

            the one-year limitations rule under 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f).

            The   supplemental    memorandum         shall     also   address   the

            substantive claims raised in Pujols-Tineo’s Motion to

            Vacate.

      (2)   Pujols-Tineo shall file any response he wishes to make

            to the Government’s supplemental memorandum on or before

            September 20, 2010.



SO ORDERED:
