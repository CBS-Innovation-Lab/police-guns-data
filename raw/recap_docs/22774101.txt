                       MEMORANDUM & ORDER

GORTON, J.

     In April, 2003, a jury convicted Shelton Lewis

(“defendant”) of one count of felon in possession of a firearm,

in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g), one count of a violation of

the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a) and one count of use of a

firearm during a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C.

§ 924(c)(1), for his role in an armed robbery which took place

in Abington, Massachusetts in September, 1999.   Defendant was

sentenced as armed career criminal to 22 years’ incarceration,

followed by 36 months of supervised release.

     In May, 2016, defendant petitioned to vacate his sentence

pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 based upon the decision in Johnson

v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015) (“Johnson II”).   The

following month, the First Circuit Court of Appeals (“First

Circuit”) allowed defendant to proceed with his Johnson II

claim.



                               -1-
      Pursuant to the parties’ joint motion, this Court stayed

defendant’s petition pending a decision by the United States

Supreme Court in Beckles v. United States, 137 S. Ct. 886

(2017).    In April, 2017, defendant filed a motion to lift the

stay and set a briefing schedule on his habeas petition.    That

motion is currently pending before the Court.

      Also pending is defendant’s petition to vacate his

sentence.   This memorandum addresses both motions.

I.    Defendant’s Motion to Lift the Stay and Set a Briefing
      Schedule

      Defendant’s motion to lift the stay and set a briefing

schedule will be allowed, in part, and denied as moot, in part.

As defendant explains, Beckles has been decided and the decision

is irrelevant to the issues presented in his § 2255 petition.

Thus, an order lifting the stay is appropriate.

      The Court will, however, deny defendant’s request to set a

briefing schedule as moot because the parties have fully briefed

the issues raised by defendant in his petition.    Therefore, a

scheduling order is unnecessary.

II.   Defendant’s § 2255 Petition

      A.    The ACCA Predicate Offenses at Issue

      The following four offenses were identified in the 2003

Pre-sentence Report (“PSR”) as predicate offenses under the

Armed Career Criminal Act (“ACCA”), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e):



                                 -2-
     1) Two convictions for armed robbery in June, 1982 (¶ 48 of
        the PSR);

     2) Conviction for armed robbery in April, 1987 (¶ 49);

     3) Conviction for armed robbery in August, 1987 (¶ 50) and

     4) Conviction for seven counts armed robbery in April,
        1987(¶ 51).1

     Defendant contends that his Massachusetts armed robbery

convictions are not ACCA predicate offenses in light of the

recent decision by the First Circuit in United States v. Starks,

861 F.3d 306 (1st Cir. 2017).

     In Starks, the First Circuit held that Massachusetts armed

robbery, codified by M.G.L. c. 265, § 17, is not a violent crime

as defined by the ACCA and, therefore, is not a predicate

offense for the purposes of designating an individual as an

armed career criminal. Id. at 320-24.   Because this Court is

bound by that decision, it concludes that, in the absence of the

requisite predicate convictions, defendant cannot be classified

as an armed career criminal. See 18 U.S.C. § 924(e).

     The government retorts that defendant has procedurally

defaulted on his Johnson II claim but the Court disagrees and

joins recent decisions in this jurisdiction rejecting the

government’s procedural default argument. See, e.g., Virden v.

United States, No. 09-10325, 2017 WL 470891, at *3 (D. Mass.


1 The two convictions for armed robbery in April, 1987 were the
result of two distinct crimes committed at different times.


                                -3-
Feb. 3, 2017) (“To date, as far as this Court is aware, every

other District Judge in Massachusetts to have considered such a

case has either found cause for the default, miscarriage of

justice, or has tacitly rejected the procedural default

challenge by proceeding directly to the merits of the underlying

claim.”).

     Accordingly, defendant’s § 2255 petition will be, with

respect to his ACCA claim, granted.

     B.     Constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)

     Defendant also submits that his conviction for violating

18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1) must be vacated because the statute is

unconstitutionally vague.   The Court declines, however, to

consider that issue because defendant is eligible for immediate

release as a result of his successful challenge to his armed

career criminal status. See Vaqueria Tres Monjitas, Inc. v.

Pagan, 748 F.3d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 2014) (“[F]ederal courts are

not to reach constitutional issues where alternative grounds for

resolution are available.” (quoting ACLU v. U.S. Conference of

Catholic Bishops, 705 F.3d 44, 52 (1st Cir.2013))).

                                 ORDER

     For the forgoing reasons,

     1)   defendant’s motion to lift the stay and establish a
          briefing schedule (Docket No. 184) is, with respect to
          the request to lift the stay, ALLOWED, but is, with
          respect to the request to set a briefing schedule,
          DENIED as moot and

     2)   defendant’s § 2255 petition to vacate (Docket No. 174)
          is, with respect to his ACCA claim, GRANTED, but is
          otherwise DENIED, as moot. The Court will re-sentence
          the defendant at the appointed time.

So ordered.
