                Defendant              )

                       ASSENTED TO MOTION FOR A CONTINUANCE

         The United States of America, by and through the undersigned attorneys, hereby moves for

a continuance of the sentencing date in this matter from the currently scheduled date of September

24, 2008 to on or about November 14, 2008.

         In support of its motion, the government states that defendant McCormack’s plea agreement

requires the defendant to cooperate with the United States. It is anticipated that the defendant will

testify in the case United States v. Arthur Gianelli, et al., Crim. No 05-10003-NMG. That is a

racketeering case in which eleven defendants are scheduled to go to trial on February 23, 2009.

Before the death of Gianelli’s attorney, Richard M. Egbert, on July 24, 2008, the parties had been

exploring the possibility of a global disposition of that case. It is anticipated that successor counsel

will enter that case shortly, so that the discussions between the parties may resume.

         Defendant McCormack assents to a continuance of his sentencing for the reasons set forth

above.

                                               Respectfully submitted,

                                               MICHAEL J. SULLIVAN
