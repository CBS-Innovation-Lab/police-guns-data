                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 08-cr-131-PB

David Caron



                                  O R D E R

     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

trial scheduled for March 3, 2009 citing the need for additional

time to schedule a plea hearing at the convenience of the court

and the parties.      The government does not object to a continuance

of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reason and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from March 3, 2009 to April 7, 2009.              In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
