                         ORDER AFFIRMING THE
              RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE


     The United States Magistrate Judge filed with the Court on September 15, 2005, his
Recommended Decision (Docket No. 30). Defendant filed his Objection to the Recommended
Decision (Docket No. 33) on October 3, 2005. Government filed its Response to Objection (Docket
No. 37) on October 20, 2005.
        I have reviewed and considered the Magistrate Judge's Recommended Decision, together
with the entire record; I have made a de novo determination of all matters adjudicated by the
Magistrate Judge's Recommended Decision; and I concur with the recommendations of the United
States Magistrate Judge for the reasons set forth in his Recommended Decision, and determine that
no further proceeding is necessary.

         1.     It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended
                Decision of the Magistrate Judge is hereby AFFIRMED.

        2.      Defendantâ€™s Motion to Suppress Evidence (Docket #18)
                is DENIED.

                                                    /s/ George Z. Singal_______________
