                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                        DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                                   Criminal No. 02-cr-96-01-PB

Brian Paquet

                                  O R D E R

     Defendant appeared for a bail revocation hearing pursuant to

18 U.S.C. ยง 3148.

     Defendant admitted the violation - consuming alcohol.               He

nevertheless sought bail.        The consumption of alcohol on 9/5

followed alcohol on his breath on 8/27.           He disregarded medical

advice and checked himself out of Elliot Hospital without the

recommended psychological evaluation.          His impulsiveness has led

to failed opportunities to comply with conditions.             I find that

the defendant is unlikely to abide by any condition or

combination of conditions.        The conditions of release are

revoked.

     Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the defendant be detained

pending trial.

     The defendant is committed to the custody of the Attorney

General or his designated representative for confinement in a

corrections facility separate, to the extent practicable, from

persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody

pending appeal.     The defendant shall be afforded a reasonable

opportunity for private consultation with defense counsel.             On

order of a court of the United States or on request of an

attorney for the government, the person in charge of the

corrections facility shall deliver the defendant to the United

States Marshal for the purpose of an appearance in connection

with a court proceeding.

      SO ORDERED.
