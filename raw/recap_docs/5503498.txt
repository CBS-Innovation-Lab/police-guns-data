    DEFENDANTâ€™S ASSENTED TO MOTION TO CONTINUE SENTENCING AND
      FOR LEAVE TO FILE OBJECTIONS TO THE PRESENTENCE REPORT

           Now comes the Defendant, Michael Ambers, by and through his counsel, Frank

D. Camera, hereby requests this Court continue the sentencing hearing for approximately

four weeks and grant him leave to file objections to the Presentence Report.

           Good cause exists for this request in that counsel has been on vacation from

August 30, 2006 through September 10, 2006. Consequently, the defendant has missed

the September 5, 2006 deadline to file his objections to the Presentence Report. Further,

defense counsel is scheduled to have five different superior court trial staring September

12, 2006 through the second week in October1. The Government has assented to this

motion.

    Upon request, counsel will provide the list of trials.
