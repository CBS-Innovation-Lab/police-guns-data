      ORDER AFFIRMING THE RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE
                     MAGISTRATE JUDGE


      The United States Magistrate Judge filed with the Court on January 10, 2020,

his Recommended Decision (ECF No. 810). The Petitioner filed his objection to the

Recommended Decision on March 6, 2020 (ECF No. 814), and the Government filed

its response to the objection on April 24, 2020 (ECF No. 818). The Court has reviewed

and considered the Magistrate Judge’s Recommended Decision, together with the

entire record; the Court has made a de novo determination of all matters adjudicated

by the Magistrate Judge's Recommended Decision; and the Court concurs with the

recommendations of the United States Magistrate Judge for the reasons set forth in

his Recommended Decision, and determines that no further proceeding is necessary.

      Jermaine Mitchell’s objection to the Magistrate Judge’s recommended decision

largely reiterates arguments made before—and rejected by—the Magistrate Judge.

Because the Court agrees with the Magistrate Judge’s analysis of those issues, the

Court does not address those portions of the objection. However, Mr. Mitchell also

states that “[t]he thrust of [the Magistrate Judge’s] position . . . is that Mr. Mitchell

cannot raise subject matter jurisdiction because of a procedural default . . ..” Pet’r’s

Resp. to U.S. Magistrate Judge’s Recommended Decision on 28 U.S.C. § 2255 Motion

at 4 (ECF No. 814). This is not correct. In his original habeas petition, Mr. Mitchell

bases his arguments about subject matter jurisdiction on the premise that the

Controlled Substances Act does not apply to him. Mot. Under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 to

Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence by a Person in Federal Custody, Attach. 1 (ECF

No. 764). The Magistrate Judge rejected this assertion as contrary to law, and so

rejected   Mr.   Mitchell’s   arguments    related   to   subject   matter   jurisdiction.

Recommended Decision on 28 U.S.C. § 2255 Mot. at 5 (ECF No. 810). The Magistrate

Judge did not, as Mr. Mitchell contends, state that Mr. Mitchell was foreclosed from

making jurisdictional arguments due to a procedural default.

      Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the

Magistrate Judge (ECF No. 810) be and hereby is AFFIRMED and the Court DENIES

with prejudice the Petitioner’s Motion Under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 to Vacate, Set Aside,

or Correct Sentence by a Person in Federal Custody (ECF No. 764). The Court

DENIES a certificate of appealability pursuant to Rule 11 of the Rules Governing

Section 2255 Cases because the Petitioner has not made a substantial showing of the

denial of a constitutional right within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).


      SO ORDERED.
