SARIS, U.S.D.J.

                                ORDER
                            May 11, 2011



     Pro se habeas petitioner Donald Gianquitto (“Petitioner”),

who has pled guilty to being a felon in possession of ammunition

under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g), brings a motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255

on grounds that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.

Petitioner claims that his counsel was deficient for three

reasons: First, he contends that counsel did not argue for a base

offense level (“BOL”) reduction pursuant to U.S. SENTENCING

GUIDELINES MANUAL § 2K2.1(b)(2) for possessing “all ammunition and

firearms solely for lawful sporting purposes or collection.”

However, the provision does not apply to defendants convicted of

an offense outlined in § 2K2.1(a)(1)-(a)(4).    As Petitioner

“committed any part of the instant offense subsequent to

sustaining one felony conviction of either a crime of violence or
a controlled substance offense1,” § 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) precluded the

sentencing court from considering a lower BOL pursuant to §

2K2.1(b)(2).     § 2K2.1(a)(4).   Given the thousands of rounds of

ammunition and the 22 receivers under defendant’s dominion and

control in a locked closet in his basement, the Court considered

the Section 3553(a) factors and would not have varied even if the

argument had been made.     However, the Court did sentence at the

low end of the range.     Second, Petitioner claims that counsel

allowed him to plead guilty to a duplicitous charge of possessing

both firearms and ammunition under § 922(g), when Petitioner pled

guilty only to possession of ammunition at his Rule 11 hearing.

The First Circuit has said that possession of both firearms and

ammunition under § 922(g) constitutes a single offense.      United

States v. Verrecchia, 196 F.3d 294, 297-298 (1st Cir. 1999).         As

the charge under § 922(g) was not duplicitous, counsel had no

obligation to inform Petitioner it was.

     Third, in his affidavit (¶6) Petitioner claims that his

attorney told him that the former AUSA promised he would not

“push for jail time.”     He claims that he believed that the

government was not going to oppose home confinement or more than

six months home confinement.      He asserts that his defense

attorney was ineffective by failing to bring this promise to the

Court’s attention.     The government shall show the Petitioner’s

affidavit to defense counsel and ask defense counsel to respond

in an affidavit.   Pending receipt of these documents, the Court

will reserve ruling on this last issue.
