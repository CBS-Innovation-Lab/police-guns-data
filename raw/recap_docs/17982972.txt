                       ORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS

      The Court has before it the Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Indictment (ECF

No. 54). The Defendant is charged with two counts of possession of a firearm by a

person previously convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence in violation

of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9). The Defendant’s underlying domestic violence conviction in

each of those counts is an assault conviction under Maine’s simple assault statute

which criminalizes intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causing bodily injury or

offensive physical contact to another person. 17-A M.R.S.A. § 207. The Government

concedes that it cannot prove that Mr. Eustis’s prior conviction was committed

intentionally or knowingly.

      On August 1, 2014, the Court reserved ruling on the Defendant’s Motion to

Dismiss the Indictment pending the outcome of United States v. Armstrong, 706 F.3d

1 (1st Cir. 2013), cert. granted, judgment vacated, 134 S. Ct. 1759 (2014), which has

raised the issue of whether an undifferentiated conviction under 17-A M.R.S.A. § 207

can support a conviction for possession of a firearm by a person convicted of a

misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.
       On January 30, 2015, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit issued its

decision in United States v. Voisine, 2015 WL 409150 (1st Cir. January 30, 2015).1

That decision clearly answers the question posed in this case in the affirmative – a

conviction for reckless assault under 17-A M.R.S.A. § 207 against a person in a

domestic relationship constitutes a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence under 18

U.S.C. § 922(g)(9).


                                         CONCLUSION

        For the reasons stated above, the Court DENIES the Defendant’s Motion to

Dismiss.

       SO ORDERED.

Dated this 4th day of February, 2015.




1       The Supreme Court had remanded both Armstrong and Voisine to the Court of Appeals for the
First Circuit for further consideration in light of United States v. Castleman, 134 S. Ct. 1405 (2014).
The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit decided both Armstrong and Voisine in United States v.
Voisine, 2015 WL 409150 (1st Cir. January 30, 2015).
