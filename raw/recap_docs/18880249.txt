                      IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                        FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO


 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
 Plaintiff
 vs                                                CRIMINAL 13-0054CCC
 EDWIN TORRES-ROSARIO
 Defendant


                                          ORDER

       Having considered the Report and Recommendation filed on March 31, 2014 (docket

entry 66) on a Rule 11 proceeding of defendant Edwin Torres-Rosario before

U.S. Magistrate Judge Marcos E. López on March 17, 2014, to which no objection has been

filed, the same is APPROVED. Accordingly, the plea of guilty of defendant is accepted. The

Court FINDS that his plea was voluntary and intelligently entered with awareness of his

rights and the consequences of pleading guilty and contains all elements of the offense

charged in the indictment.

       This case was referred to the U.S. Probation Office for preparation of a Presentence

Investigation Report since March 17, 2014. The sentencing hearing is set for July 15,

2014 at 4:15 PM.

       The U.S. Probation Officer is reminded that, should any objections be raised by

defendant to the PreSentence Report, the Addendum to said PreSentence Report must

specifically identify any unresolved objections, the grounds for the objections, and the

U.S. Probation Officer’s comments on them, as required by Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(g). The

party that raised the unresolved objections shall, within twenty-four (24) hours after the

Addendum is disclosed, state in writing whether it will insist that the unresolved objections

be ruled upon by the Court. Failure to do so will be deemed by the Court as a withdrawal

of the unresolved objections.

      SO ORDERED.

      At San Juan, Puerto Rico, on April 21, 2014.
