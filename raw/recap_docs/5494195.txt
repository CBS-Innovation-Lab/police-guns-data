          2                     (The following proceedings were held in open court

          3      before the Honorable Nathaniel M. Gorton, United States

          4      District Judge, United States District Court, District of

          7                     The defendant, Reynaldo Rivera, is present with

          8      counsel.     Assistant U.S. Attorney William Bloomer is present.)

         13                     Would counsel please identify themselves for the

         14      record.

         15                     MR. BLOOMER:       Good afternoon, your Honor.         William

          1                     PROBATION OFFICER:        Yes.

          2                     THE COURT:      Please be seated.       We are here on the

          3      sentencing of Mr. Reynaldo Rivera, and I have received and read

          4      the presentence report, the government's sentencing memorandum

          5      and the defendant's memorandum in aid of sentencing.

          6                     Is there anything that I haven't mentioned that I

          7      should have received in writing, Mr. Bloomer?

          8                     MR. BLOOMER:       Nothing from the government.

          9                     THE COURT:      Mr. Donaldson?

         10                     MR. DONALDSON:       Nothing from the defense, your

         11      Honor.

         12                     THE COURT:      All right.     Then as I understand it, we

         13      obviously need to go through this three-prong process, the

         14      first of which is to establish the appropriate guideline range

         15      and then to consider whether any departures are warranted or

         16      any matters under 3553(a) would warrant a variance to a

         17      guideline sentence.        I understand there have been a few

         18      objections filed by both the government and the defendants to

         19      the presentence report.          And basically they all turn on, first,

         20      the amount of drugs to be attributed to this defendant,

         21      Mr. Rivera, and then his role in the offense, whether or not a

         22      three-level increase should be granted or attached on the basis

         23      that Mr. Rivera was a manager of a substantial criminal

         24      enterprise.

         25                     As I understand it, the government has informed the

                                                                                             5




          1      Court that it believes the amount of drugs that Mr. Rivera

          2      should be charged with is the lower amount, that is, between

          3      400 and 700 grams of heroin rather than in excess of 700 grams,

          4      but that the Court -- the government apparently believes that

          5      the amount is so close to 700 that it could go either way.

          6                     Is that correct?

          7                     MR. BLOOMER:       That's right, your Honor.         It's right

          8      on the cusp of 700 grams.          And where this was a case, as this

          9      Court recalls, there were 12 defendants and there was a log jam

         10      in that no one had pled guilty and with the exception of a

         11      couple of defendants as the trial approached.                And I felt that

         12      the weight of the heroin was so close to 700 that perhaps the

         13      benefit of the doubt would cut in favor of the defendant under

         14      United States v. Sklar.

         15                     THE COURT:      And which of the particularly

         16      attributed amounts of drugs would the government suggest brings

         17      it back down to close to the 700 gram level?

         18                     MR. BLOOMER:       Well --

         19                     THE COURT:      Because apparently if you add them all

         20      up, it's 735.       So you're only 35 grams into that category.

         21                     MR. BLOOMER:       Only 35 grams into the category.          The

         22      one -- I think it was paragraph 90 where it described

         23      Mr. Torrado -- a 50-gram pickup that was apparently

         24      Mr. Santiago used Mr. Rivera's truck in order to leave some

         25      drugs for Mr. Torrado.         There was no indication about, you

          1      know, the defendant knew how much drugs were going to be put

          2      there, what type of drugs or who was going to pick them up.                      It

          3      was just can I use the office, meaning the car, and Rivera said

          4      yes.     So it was kind of ambiguous.         If there was one

          5      transaction you could say you can deduct, that would be it.

          6                     THE COURT:      All right, thank you.

          7                     Mr. Donaldson, do you wish to address that issue?

          8                     MR. DONALDSON:       Yes, your Honor.         If it please the

          9      Court.

         10                     THE COURT:      Yes, you may.

         11                     MR. DONALDSON:       With respect to the 50 grams that

         12      the government has just discussed, it wasn't any drugs, I

         13      believe, that was left in the office.             He said he needed him to

         14      facilitate or that he wanted his friend to meet him -- his

         15      friend being Torrado -- to meet him up on the hill.                  I believe

         16      that's the way it was established.            And that he told him that

         17      he had been waiting all day to receive those but that he would

         18      leave some food for, speaking in terms of drugs, that he would

         19      leave some food for him but that never took place.                  So that was

         20      the 50 grams.

         21                     THE COURT:      That was the one on September 30th?

         22                     MR. DONALDSON:       That would be September 30th,

         23      2004.     I didn't put that in my memorandum because I knew that

         24      the drugs was more than 400, but I knew assuredly that it was

         25      less than 700.       There was at least two or three other issues

          1      that I brought to the Court's attention with respect to 80

          2      grams that there was a negotiation between Zuleima Reyes,

          3      Mr. Rivera and Detective Chavez, the undercover agent.

          4                     THE COURT:      That was the February 12th incident?

          5                     MR. DONALDSON:       Yes.

          6                     THE COURT:      And they were discussing how much he

          7      could purchase the drugs for.           And the three of them agreed

          8      upon a price but no drugs were ever purchased.                 There was never

          9      any meeting when they were going to get together to sell drugs,

         10      any of that -- any of those things took place.

         11                     Also, your Honor, I pointed out on October the

         12      15th, 2004 when the officers arrested Zuleima Reyes, they found

         13      39.7 grams -- 39.6 grams at her residence.                And she said she

         14      was holding those there for Rey.              I would like to take

         15      exception to that for two reasons.              If the government -- I

         16      mean, if the Court would believe that the 39.7 grams was in

         17      fact being held for Rey -- for Mr. Rivera, then that is close

         18      enough to the date of the purchase of the other grams of

         19      cocaine -- not cocaine, heroin.               Excuse me, your Honor.

         20      Because on the -- I believe it was the 14th there was a

         21      purchase of 140 --

         22                     THE COURT:      180.

         23                     MR. DONALDSON:       Well, there was 180 seized from

         24      Mr. Rivera's address.         And I believe that there's a level of

         25      double counting there.         For example, there was a -- there was

                                                                                               8




          1      a -- on the 13th there was a purchase of a hundred -- I want to

          2      make sure I have it right, your Honor.              I have to go back to my

          3      note.    On the 13th there was a purchase for 140 grams.                And

          4      then they found another 18 grams at his house on the 10th -- on

          5      the 15th of August.

          6                     THE COURT:      Okay.    But he wasn't attributed that

          7      first 140.      At least according to the presentence report, in

          8      paragraph 133 he is held accountable only for the 180 that was

          9      seized at the residence.

         10                     MR. DONALDSON:       Right.    And my suggestion is is

         11      that if -- but there was -- there was -- on 9/20/2004 there was

         12      also a person who bought 120 grams.             My argument is you could

         13      look at it both ways.         It could -- that 120 grams could be in

         14      the 140 grams.       And the 39 -- that 39.7 grams, if she was

         15      holding it for Mr. Rivera, could be part of --

         16                     THE COURT:      I understand your point.

         17                     MR. DONALDSON:       Okay.     The other issue is that with

         18      respect to this 39.7 grams is cut another way, your Honor,

         19      there is discussions on October the 29th -- I'm sorry, January

         20      the 29th, 2004 between Detective Chavez and Zuleima Reyes that

         21      Mr. Rivera and her were no longer working together and that she

         22      was on her own, that he had nothing to do with any more of

         23      those sales.      And she was -- and he was to deal directly with

         24      her.    And that occurred on the 29th.           On the 30th of January he

         25      purchased 30 grams of heroin from Miss Reyes.                They're also

                                                                                             9




          1      attributing that 30 grams to Mr. Rivera as well.                And then

          2      gathering those calculations would be the 80 grams, the 30

          3      grams, the 39.7 grams, and the 50 grams would come up to

          4      approximately 249 grams off the 736 grams, which, again, we're

          5      still in between the 400 and 700 range, but we're not over the

          6      700 range.

          7                     THE COURT:      I understand.      I understand your

          8      position.     Well, the Court believes that there is enough

          9      ambiguity in the attribution of the amount of drugs

         10      attributable to Mr. Rivera that the -- under a preponderance of

         11      the evidence standard the Court will find that the amount

         12      attributed is under 700 grams but just barely.                It seems to me

         13      it's very close to 700 grams.           I do not accept all of the

         14      claims of Mr. Donaldson on behalf of the defendant, but I do

         15      accept the fact that there is enough ambiguity on several of

         16      them so that the Court would be best guided by finding the

         17      amount of drugs between 400 and 700 grams.               I do for the

         18      record, however, note that the Court believes it's much closer

         19      to 700 than 400.       And, therefore, I am not accepting the

         20      probation department's recommendation.              And that means that

         21      under Guideline 2D1.1, which is the appropriate guideline that

         22      we're dealing with here, and particularly the 2006 manual which

         23      is the one that is recommended that we use, the appropriate

         24      base offense level would be 28 rather than the recommended 30.

         25                     There is now also an objection by the defendant to

          1      the attribution of the three-level increase for the role in the

          2      offense under 3B1.1(b).          There seems to be ample evidence that

          3      the Court is aware of that Mr. Rivera was, in fact, a manager

          4      or supervisor and that he supervised one or probably most

          5      likely two others who were involved in this very extensive 12

          6      or more persons conspiracy to distribute heroin in the Lowell,

          7      Massachusetts area.

          8                     I've read your response to that, Mr. Donaldson, and

          9      I'll be glad to hear you if you wish to amplify your argument

         10      in that regard.

         11                     MR. DONALDSON:       Thank you, your Honor.        If it

         12      pleases the Court.

         13                     As your Honor is aware, your Honor has already

         14      stated that you find that there's ample, so I'm not going to

         15      belabor the point because I don't want to in any way appear

         16      that I'm disrespecting the Court.

         17                     THE COURT:      You're entitled to your opinions,

         18      Mr. Donaldson, and you can express them.

         19                     MR. DONALDSON:       Okay, thank you, your Honor.

         20                     Number one, there is nothing in the record and with

         21      respect to the exhibits that I gave you that showed that there

         22      was any other -- any more of a decision-making authority over

         23      either one of the two individuals.            That would be Arroyo or --

          1      record that indicated that Mr. Rivera recruited those two

          2      individuals, and there's nothing in the record that indicated

          3      that he got or received a larger share of the profits with

          4      respect to those limited sells.               There's nothing in the record,

          5      your Honor, that would indicate he had any degree of control or

          6      authority over either one of those two individuals.

          7                     What you have, your Honor, is -- if I can deal with

          8      Mr. Reyes first.       Of the exhibits that I gave your Honor, it

          9      indicates by the understanding of Mr. Chavez that Miss Reyes

         10      was in fact Mr. Rivera's girl friend.              They were in a

         11      boyfriend/girl friend relationship.              And oftentimes, especially

         12      in these types of relationship, the business, they were

         13      partners, your Honor.         They were partners.        There is no

         14      street-level dealer who is going to give a source to a -- give

         15      a wholesale source -- give a source to their supplier and cut

         16      out their profit in that overall scheme.

         17                     In other words, what I'm saying is that if I'm the

         18      street-level dealer and I'm being supervised or managed by my

         19      supplier or my boss, I'm not going to -- because the only way

         20      I'm going to make my money is if I go out and sell the drugs,

         21      you know, what I get for them, I'm not going to take one of my

         22      clients and introduce them to my boss and tell my boss, look,

         23      this guy wants to buy large amounts of drug, what kind of price

         24      are you going to give him?           And even if that was the case,

         25      there is no indication that Mr. Rivera paid her any money or

                                                                                             12




          1      recruited her to do that.

          2                     There is no indication that Mr. Rivera controlled

          3      that whole situation.         It's more that Detective Chavez -- of

          4      course that's his job.         He controlled the situation along with

          5      Mr. Rivera because she wanted, as a general partner would do

          6      with another person you're in business with, is to say, look,

          7      how much can we sell these drugs to this person for?                 And they

          8      calculated what the drugs should be sold for.               And that was

          9      consistent.

         10                     And if you look at some of the other discussions in

         11      there with respect to Mr. Rivera and Mr. Santiago, one of the

         12      of individuals who went to trial on this case, he asked her

         13      about Mr. -- and he specifically asked Mr. Rivera about Miss

         14      Reyes, and Mr. Rivera said we're not friends anymore.                 And she

         15      had indicated that earlier back in February that they weren't

         16      together anymore as well.          But they actually had a business

         17      relationship and they were partners in that business

         18      relationship.

         19                     It appears based upon the sales, your Honor,

         20      that -- and it would appear at first glance that Mr. Rivera was

         21      a supervisor/manager over these two individuals or especially

         22      Miss Reyes.      But then that would cut against, you know, women

         23      who are out here in this business as well.              They're just as

         24      smart and just as intelligent.            And it would cut against -- I

         25      would -- I would compare that to being a chauvinistic approach

          1      to say that every woman who's involved with another person in

          2      drug transactions that they, you know, are always going to be

          3      the subordinate of the man.            Sometimes there are women who are

          4      in these relationships and they are managers and supervisors.

          5      But in this particular situation they were co-partners in their

          6      endeavor.

          7                     On the other hand, your Honor, you have the one

          8      sell, Mr. Arroyo, back in December of 2003.                 Mr. Arroyo in

          9      December of 2003, basically he gets -- Detective Chavez makes a

         10      telephone call.       He says that it's Mr. Rivera but he doesn't

         11      know for a fact that it's Mr. Rivera.             He just assumes that

         12      it's Mr. Rivera because he has access to the telephone number.

         13      And later on that -- after that Mr. Rivera comes -- not

         14      Mr. Rivera, Mr. Arroyo comes and makes the sale.                 There's no

         15      indication that Mr. Rivera recruited him to make that sale,

         16      there's no indication that Mr. Rivera paid him to make that

         17      sale, there's no evidence on -- on the -- on the other hand

         18      either that he was just doing that as a favor for Mr. Rivera.

         19      There's no indication that Mr. Rivera -- that he actually even

         20      worked for Mr. Rivera other than any maybe self-serving

         21      statements that Arroyo said after he was arrested just to place

         22      the blame on someone.

         23                     But the facts taken into consideration, the total

         24      circumstances of this transaction, if he worked for Mr. Rivera,

         25      that would not only be the first time that he was able to work

          1      for him.     He would have worked on him in other indications.

          2      There's no indications after all the phone taps and, you know,

          3      the pager taps that there would be some communications between

          4      Mr. Arroyo and Mr. Rivera.           There is none.     So it doesn't

          5      indicate that he actually recruited him or even that he worked

          6      for him or that he even had control over this individual.

          7                     What Mr. Rivera was was a distributor.             He sold

          8      drugs; he bought drugs.          Sometimes if Mr. Santiago needed to

          9      have some contact with Mr. Torrado, he'd ask him where

         10      Mr. Torrado was but only because Mr. Torrado and Mr. Rivera was

         11      friends.     But Mr. Torrado cut his own deal with Mr. Santiago as

         12      well.    And that's what we have here.

         13                     So under these circumstances, your Honor, I would

         14      not suggest that by a preponderance of the evidence that

         15      Mr. Rivera was a manager.          I would suggest that he was no more

         16      than a middle man who was out there trying to make as much

         17      money as he could, and he did not under those circumstances

         18      have anybody working for him because he was taking the most

         19      money for himself.

         20                     THE COURT:      Thank you, Mr. Donaldson.

         22                     MR. BLOOMER:       My wife would be upset if I sought a

         23      role enhancement because I was a chauvinist.                I would limit

         24      myself to the evidence and that is that the undercover agent

         25      negotiated a sale with Mr. Rivera, Mr. Rivera sent Mr. Santiago

          1      Arroyo to consummate the sale.            Whenever the undercover agent

          2      sought a price reduction or sought a large amount of heroin,

          3      Miss Reyes said she had to check with her guy and at one point

          4      referred to him as her boss and then reached out to Mr. Reyes.

          5      The fact --

          6                     THE COURT:      You mean Mr. Rivera.

          7                     MR. Bloomer:       Mr. Rivera.     I'm sorry.     The fact

          8      that they had a relationship as well doesn't mean that he can't

          9      be her supervisor.        The evidence shows that he supervised Miss

         10      Reyes, sent her to consummate the deals, and whatever

         11      negotiations went through Miss Reyes had to get Mr. Rivera's

         12      permission or authority to either lower the price or to get

         13      large amounts of heroin.

         14                     I just want to clarify one thing.            Mr. Donaldson

         15      indicates that Miss Reyes said she was no longer with him or

         16      dealing with Mr. Rivera.          The evidence is that when they were

         17      negotiating the 80-gram delivery, there was -- there was some

         18      negotiation about the price.           Ms. Reyes, the information showed

         19      contact with Mr. Rivera; Mr. Rivera then showed contact with

         20      Mr. Santiago.       Mr. Santiago then came to Mr. Rivera's house.

         21      There was conversation that they were all set for the deal.

         22      And because we had had enough information to get a wiretap and

         23      we didn't want to spend another X thousands of dollars, we

         24      cancelled the sale.        There was an indication in subsequent

         25      conversations that Ms. Reyes and Mr. Rivera were very upset

          1      that that sale was cancelled and that ultimately it ended with

          2      a call we're not doing that anymore.             Click.     That was the call

          3      Mr. Donaldson was referring to in February.                 After that we went

          4      up on wires.

          5                     So I would suggest clearly by a preponderance of

          6      the evidence he's worthy of a role enhancement.

          7                     THE COURT:      Mr. Donaldson?

          8                     MR. DONALDSON:       If I may, your Honor.         As

          9      Mr. Bloomer indicated that they were upset, it wasn't that

         10      Mr. Rivera was just upset.           I'd also like to point your Honor

         11      to 3B1.1 comment note 4, which indicates that, you know, terms

         12      such as boss or leader, of that nature, terms of that nature

         13      are not controlling with respect to these issues as it relates

         14      to roles --

         15                     THE COURT:      They're not controlling but they are

         16      evidence, are they not, Mr. Donaldson?

         17                     MR. DONALDSON:       They are evidence, your Honor.

         18      That's why I say in the totality of the circumstances, if we're

         19      going to cut it one way or the other, I think a liberal reading

         20      of all the evidence would indicate that he was not the manager,

         21      that he was no more than a distributor.

         22                     THE COURT:      Well, the Court respectfully disagrees

         23      with defendant's counsel and finds that Mr. Rivera was, in

         24      fact, a manager as that term is defined in the Sentencing

         25      Guidelines at 3B1.1(b), which instructs the Court that if the

                                                                                             17




          1      defendant was a manager or supervisor but not an organizer or

          2      leader and the criminal activity involved five or more

          3      participants or was otherwise extensive, then I am to increase

          4      the base offense level by three.

          5                     The Court finds that Mr. Rivera qualifies as a

          6      manager or supervisor in this case clearly over an extended

          7      period of time, and on the basis of the preponderance of the

          8      evidence standard, the Court so finds.             Therefore, a

          9      three-level aggravating role adjustment is made.                And that

         10      means that the adjusted offense level is 33.                The defendant is,

         11      in turn, entitled to a three-level downward adjustment for

         12      acceptance --

         13                     MR. DONALDSON:       Excuse me, your Honor.        I

         14      apologize.      You said the adjusted level would be 33.

         15                     THE COURT:      I misspoke.     It should be 31.       Thank

         16      you, Mr. Donaldson.        Because we started at 28.          I stand

         17      corrected.      We go from 28 to 31 for the adjustment in the role

         18      in the offense and then back to 28 for a three-level downward

         19      adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, and that's the

         20      total offense level that the Court finds.

         21                     There is no criminal history, or at least no

         22      recorded convictions, and therefore the defendant falls in

         23      Criminal History Category I.           And that means that for the

         24      purposes of the guideline at 28-1, it would be a 78 to 97-month

         25      range for sentencing.

          1                     I will hear counsel.           I understand there are no

          2      motions for a departure under the guidelines.               Is that correct,

          3      Mr. Donaldson?

          4                     MR. DONALDSON:       Well, your Honor, I wasn't asking

          5      for a departure.       I was asking for a variance.

          6                     THE COURT:      I understand.      We will get to that, but

          7      I need to go through the steps.

          8                     And the government doesn't have anything with

          9      respect to departure, correct?

         10                     MR. BLOOMER:       No.

         11                     THE COURT:      Now, Mr. Donaldson I'll hear you as to

         12      why I should vary this sentence from the guideline sentence if

         13      you wish to address that issue.

         14                     MR. DONALDSON:       Okay.     Your Honor, there are

         15      several reasons why I'm asking the Court to vary the sentence

         16      and take it out of the base offense level of 28.                The first

         17      reason, your Honor, and I think that I can deal with this issue

         18      quite succinctly, is the issue that as I pointed out in my

         19      memorandum, there was some time in February of -- I want to say

         20      2005 -- it was --

         21                     THE COURT:      The incident was in '04.         He was

         22      arrested in October of '04.

         23                     MR. DONALDSON:       Right.     I want to make sure that --

         24      2006, your Honor.        I have been in some discussions, basic,

         25      rudimentary discussions with the government about Mr. Rivera

          1      cooperating with the government with respect to opportunity for

          2      a 5K1 departure.       And I advised him that I would get back to

          3      him.    We did have a scheduled meeting for, I believe, sometime

          4      around February 4th or sometime in that area.               But during that

          5      period of time, I can't remember exactly, but there was a huge

          6      snowstorm and there was a lot of things that had closed down.

          7      Our schedules kind of conflicted, and then sometime in March of

          8      2006 is when the police officers came to Mr. Rivera's house,

          9      entered his house under the pretext that they had heard of some

         10      complaints.

         11                     At that point in time, Mr. Rivera was at home alone

         12      with his now 6-year-old child.            They took Mr. Rivera, separated

         13      him from his 6-year-old child, took the 6-year-old child

         14      upstairs into the bedroom by himself and I think either one or

         15      two other agents.        And there was another three or four agents

         16      that stayed downstairs with Mr. Rivera and continued to

         17      question Mr. Rivera, can you buy drugs for us?                Can you get

         18      drugs for us?       We want to get some drugs.         How soon can you get

         19      some drugs for us?        And at all times he kept telling them that

         20      he was on probation, he doesn't do that stuff, he's on house

         21      confinement with the exception of going to work, if they have

         22      any questions, they should be contacting his attorney.                  He

         23      called me incessantly the whole time that everything was going

         24      on because he had his phone underneath the table, he kept

         25      redialing my phone.

          1                     When I came out of my meeting I looked at all these

          2      calls, I called him and asked him what was going on.                 He told

          3      me just what I just told you.           I called pretrial probation

          4      services.     I questioned pretrial probation services.              The

          5      probation officer was Chris Wylie at the time.                I asked him why

          6      are you sending police officers out to my client?                And he says

          7      he doesn't know anything about it.            So he said he would contact

          8      the necessary people and get back with me and let me know.

          9      Needless to say, the police officers at that point in time,

         10      state, federal were not honest with him as well.

         11                     THE COURT:      They were not what?

         12                     MR. DONALDSON:       They were not honest with Mr. Wylie

         13      as well.     They gave him no information.           At this point in time

         14      the mother and father and the wife of Mr. Rivera came home

         15      because that's where he was living.            Under the terms and

         16      conditions of pretrial probation, he was to stay with his

         17      parents.     They came home.       Everybody was scared at this point

         18      in time.     Mr. Chris Wylie had no indication, couldn't tell us

         19      whether or not these were police officers or whether they

         20      weren't because as far as Mr. Wylie was concerned, they weren't

         21      police officers because all of the authorities that he

         22      contacted, including the Lowell Police Department, the State

         23      Police barracks and all around, no one gave him any information

         24      to ensure him that that was a police activity.                So at that

         25      point in time Mr. Wylie made the decision in fear of the safety

                                                                                             21




          1      of Mr. Rivera, his two children, his wife, his father and his

          2      mother, removed them from the house and put them in a safe

          3      hotel for over the weekend until we were able to conduct an

          4      investigation that following Monday to determine what was

          5      happening.

          6                     Needless to say, your Honor, that type of activity

          7      is so outrageous that it would shock the conscience of any

          8      court when a person like that is under probation, especially

          9      the terms and conditions of probation where he's not to have

         10      any contact with anybody.          Not only that, that they knew that

         11      he was represented by counsel.            Notwithstanding those Sixth

         12      Amendment, those basic issues, they came into his house and

         13      violated his constitutional rights.

         14                     But there's another issue, your Honor.             Mr. Rivera

         15      was involved in a very, very dirty business.                There's no --

         16      that's why we're here, and that's why he's going to be punished

         17      today.    But his family, his mother and father, they didn't sign

         18      up for that.      He was not living with them when he was involved

         19      in that business.        They signed up -- they signed up with the

         20      Court to supervise him and to be responsible for him while he

         21      was in custody or under pretrial release.              What the government

         22      did was they intruded this house and basically scared the

         23      living day lights out of him, scared for his children, for his

         24      wife, his father and his mother to the point that Mr. Rivera

         25      was chilled at that point in time whether he could even trust

                                                                                             22




          1      the government, to whether he could even function under a 5K1

          2      proffer because at this point in time no one was prepared to be

          3      honest with him.

          4                     Your Honor, under those circumstances, I believe

          5      that this is an atypical type of situation that would take this

          6      case out of the heartland of normal cases and that he should be

          7      able to be sentenced as if he was going to give a -- as if he

          8      was going to cooperate with the government for purposes of a

          9      5K1 departure.        I didn't ask for departure because technically

         10      it's not a departure if he doesn't cooperate.               And then the

         11      government would have to motion for that.              So there's no way

         12      that we could do it.

         13                     So my suggestion, your Honor, would be -- I'm

         14      requesting a variance based upon that, your Honor.                 The reason

         15      why I'm requesting a variance based upon that is because

         16      constitutionally he was chilled from even being able to

         17      participate in that process, to participate in sitting down

         18      with the government, going with the government with respect to

         19      how he obtained his drugs from Mr. Santiago, with respect to

         20      how he sold his drugs, with respect to what he knew about

         21      Mr. Santiago.       The government told me explicitly that if they

         22      were going to give him anything, that he would have to testify

         23      against Mr. Santiago.         That's the conversation that I had with

         24      Mr. Rivera.      That's the first issue, your Honor.

         25                     The second issue, your Honor, is that I believe

                                                                                             23




          1      that if your Honor would take a careful consideration and take

          2      a look at Mr. Rivera's age, he's 28 years old.                At his

          3      educational level.        He graduated from high school in Puerto

          4      Rico.    He came to the United States with a license to perform

          5      electric -- electricity duties and while he was here he got a

          6      license to be a forklift driver.

          7                     Now, Mr. Rivera was doing electrical work and

          8      forklifting duties at Kmart.           He got laid off and he was living

          9      with his wife and his two children.            During that time, your

         10      Honor, after he got laid off, he made the selfish decision to

         11      go out and start selling drugs, more specifically poison in the

         12      terrible drug of heroin, which is one of the most terrible

         13      drugs that we all know of.           It's definitely in the top two,

         14      three worst drugs that anybody can take.              He made that

         15      self-decision.        He accepted that responsibility, your Honor.

         16      He said that he was guilty.

         17                     I enlightened him on the issues with respect to

         18      when police come into your house and all that.                He could have

         19      done a lot of different things with respect to how when the

         20      police came into the house illegally.             But he didn't.       He said

         21      this is what happened, I'm going to tell you the truth from

         22      this point forward, I'm going to be honest about everything, I

         23      made the wrong decision, I caused a lot of pain with respect to

         24      my children, they had to sacrifice, they didn't ask for this,

         25      my wife didn't ask for it, my parents really didn't ask for it,

                                                                                              24




          1      and I made these bad decisions and I'm going to stand up like a

          2      man and I'm going to take responsibility for it.                So he's -- at

          3      this point in time he's not making any lies, your Honor.                    The

          4      only thing he wants to do is he wants to pay for what he's done

          5      and get his life straight again.

          6                     When I say "these things," your Honor, we take a

          7      look at his record when he was out on pretrial probation.

          8      Within six months while he was on pretrial probation, he was

          9      allowed to have gainful employment, your Honor.                While he was

         10      out on gainful employment, your Honor, he worked two jobs.

         11      First job he was working -- he worked delivering glass

         12      windshields for cars.         After that he started repairing auto

         13      windshields.      And his bosses took enough respect and enough

         14      trust in him that they gave him that opportunity to do that.

         15      And they taught him how to do that and taught him how to even

         16      open up his own business if he wanted to.

         17                     I would also suggest, your Honor, that not only did

         18      he do that but he was given the responsibility to leave his

         19      house at 7:00 in the morning and to get home before 6.                  And he

         20      had to drive all the way down to Quincy.              Sometimes -- and his

         21      whole area was all of Massachusetts.             But no matter what, your

         22      Honor, he would make sure that he did his job in a way that he

         23      would get home not later than 6.              And if he was going to be

         24      between 6 and 6:30, notwithstanding the rush hours on these

         25      highways and everything, he would always call his probation

          1      officer.     I'm sure your Honor saw the date of sentencing where

          2      Probation Officer Wylie represented that Mr. Rivera -- let me

          3      see if I have it here.         I moved my stuff around when the other

          4      attorneys came on the other case.             I'd just like to read it for

          5      the Court.      If I can have just one second, your Honor.

          6                     THE COURT:      Yes.

          7                     (Pause.)

          8                     MR. DONALDSON:       Okay, your Honor.       On October 16,

          9      2006 authored by Christopher R. Reilly, he indicated that

         10      Mr. Rivera has been in full compliance with his bail conditions

         11      and checked with Massachusetts Criminal History Board there's

         12      no new warrants, no new arrests while on his release.                 And I'm

         13      saying all these things, your Honor, is to say that he started

         14      his part of rehabilitation before he -- while he was out on

         15      pretrial probation before he said that he was guilty.                 He

         16      started his part of rehabilitation.            And I would suggest, your

         17      Honor, that in looking at the U.S. sentencing Commission on

         18      measuring recidivism, it clearly indicates that someone that is

         19      in a -- between the ages of 26 and 30 years old with zero

         20      criminal history points and has a very, very small chance to

         21      get back in trouble, to get rearrested on issues.

         22                     And I would suggest, your Honor, that his is even

         23      less than that because he already has licenses, he already has,

         24      you know, a semi-career.          You know, he knows electricity.           He

         25      now knows how to fix windows.           And he has indicated to me that

                                                                                              26




          1      as soon as he gets placed into a facility, a jail, that he's

          2      going to further his education on electricity and see if he can

          3      get any other type of licensing and degrees that he can get

          4      while he's in there.         So I would suggest, your Honor, that you

          5      take that into consideration.

          6                     You also take into consideration, your Honor, the

          7      fact that Mr. Rivera has a very, very strong family -- knit

          8      family group.       His mother and his father have supported him a

          9      hundred percent through this whole process.                 His wife is still

         10      here through this whole process.              Again, this happened back in

         11      2004.    She's aware that, you know, he was involved with a

         12      relationship with somebody else during that period of time when

         13      they were selling drugs, but she is there for him and she's --

         14      and they're still together as husband and wife.                 And, you know,

         15      he has that financial support as well as the emotional support

         16      that he needs to be when he comes out to be a good, strong

         17      citizen so that he can come out and work without having to

         18      worry about getting in trouble.

         19                     I'm sure that his family -- and his father's

         20      already indicated to me that, you know, he would do anything

         21      that he can to make sure that when Rey does come out of jail,

         22      that he is going to ask his boss to give him a job or at least

         23      try to, you know, put him in touch with other individuals that

         24      are in positions that can help him find gainful employment when

         25      he gets out.

          1                     THE COURT:      Thank you, Mr. Donaldson.

          2                     Mr. Bloomer?

          3                     MR. BLOOMER:       I'm not sure where to begin, your

          4      Honor.    I don't know if the Court wants to --

          5                     THE COURT:      What about this incident in February of

          6      '06.     How does the government respond to that having an impact

          7      on this sentencing?

          8                     MR. BLOOMER:       I have no idea how it has an impact

          9      on the sentencing.        It's been my position all along that that

         10      is irrelevant, it had no impact -- this is not the forum, this

         11      is not the proceeding to address that.             Mr. Donaldson said that

         12      we had basic rudimentary discussions about a possible plea

         13      before this interest -- this incident.             That is generous to say

         14      the least.      We talked on the phone a couple of times.             I made

         15      it clear to Mr. Donaldson that it was the government's

         16      position, number one, that he was not safety valve eligible

         17      because he was a manager or a supervisor and, therefore,

         18      anything he told us that he was not getting, in my view, a

         19      safety valve departure.

         20                     Number two, yes, it would involve him having to

         21      testify against Mr. Santiago because that's the only way he

         22      could have gotten a departure.            However, we never got to the

         23      point as to whether or not Mr. Rivera was going to testify

         24      against Mr. Santiago.         As a matter of fact, the indications

         25      were that he would not.          We had -- and after I received this --

          1      I just want to say that I got this late, Judge.                The filings

          2      weren't even given to me.          I had to go to the clerk's office to

          3      get this.     After I got it, I went through my notes to determine

          4      exactly what happened.         In January --

          5                     MR. DONALDSON:       I apologize, your Honor.         But this

          6      is one issue.       I hand delivered this up to his office the same

          7      day that I was down here.          So --

          8                     THE COURT:      That was no more than two days ago,

          9      which was late to begin with, Mr. Donaldson.

         10                     MR. DONALDSON:       Yes.      Yes.

         11                     MR. BLOOMER:       I'm referring to the motion to

         12      continue, your Honor, where it lays it out in the affidavit

         13      exactly what he alleged happened.

         14                     THE COURT:      Okay.

         15                     MR. BLOOMER:       The end of January I spoke with

         16      Mr. Donaldson.        We agreed to set up a meeting to determine

         17      whether or not Mr. Rivera would come in for a meeting in early

         18      September.      Mr. Donaldson didn't come for that meeting.                 I'm

         19      not sure what happened, but he didn't show up for the meeting.

         20      I tried to call him on a number of different occasions, did not

         21      get returned calls.        Time went by.        The end of March, my

         22      understanding is I left the office for Friday.                I come in on

         23      Monday, I got a call from Chris Wylie saying the police paid

         24      Mr. Rivera a visit.        I called various police agencies, found

         25      out that the Lowell police in fact responded to what I was told

                                                                                               29




          1      were reports of unduly loud noise and neighbor complaints to

          2      Mr. Rivera's parents' house.           And when they responded, they

          3      were surprised to see Mr. Rivera there.               They thought that he

          4      was held on pretrial detention.               So I reported that to the

          5      Court.    I had no prior knowledge that that had occurred.                   And I

          6      reported to Mr. Wylie exactly what happened.

          7                     I have no idea how this affects the sentence.                 I

          8      really don't, Judge.         There was no indication, and this Court

          9      knows, not one person in this case cooperated.                 We had 12

         10      defendants.      Out of 12 defendants zero cooperated and they

         11      expressed fear of Mr. Santiago and retribution had they

         12      testified.      All indications to me was that Mr. Rivera was not

         13      going to testify.        He was not interested in that.           And, as a

         14      matter of fact, the trial in this case started on October 15th

         15      of 2006.     October 12th was the day that I was informed that

         16      Mr. Rivera was going to plea and that there would be no plea

         17      agreement, that he was just going to plea straight up.                   I don't

         18      understand how this visit from the police, even if it wasn't

         19      proper, impacts sentencing.

         20                     I bring the Court back, Judge, to the facts of the

         21      case and that this defendant was the primary -- and I say the

         23      in fact, began in response to complaints of drug dealing

         24      involving Mr. Rivera and Mr. Santiago.              That's how this whole

         25      investigation began.         When they execute a search warrant at the

                                                                                              30




          1      end of the investigation, 180 grams of heroin, a finger

          2      press -- this Court remembers, I'm sure, the expert, Trooper

          3      Shapiro, demonstrating how that finger press worked, that black

          4      finger press in his residence, latex gloves, actually boxes of

          5      fingers that had been precut were found, a digital scale,

          6      $3,200 in cash.

          7                     Judge, this is a serious offense that demands, I

          8      suggest, severe punishment.            Ninety-seven months I suggest to

          9      this Court is reasonable.          Why do I say 97 months?         Because

         10      when I looked at the GSR based upon what I thought was the

         11      appropriate weight and I compared to what probation came up

         12      with, 97 months overlapped.            In other words, for the base

         13      offense level for 30 it was 97 to 121; for 28 it was 78 to 97.

         14      And where he was found responsible for close to 700 grams of

         15      heroin, I felt that 97 months was a fair and reasonable

         16      sentence for this individual to serve given the severity of the

         17      offense and his role in this offense.

         18                     And I would harken the Court to the sentences that

         19      have been meted out today.           That 97 months I suggest is

         20      perfect.     When we look at Santiago receiving 248 months; his

         21      supplier, Juan Nunez, getting 151 months; another major

         22      customer, Carlos Sanchez, getting 127 months; a career offender

         23      getting 264 months.        And then you have the lower level players

         24      such as Zuleima Reyes getting 36 months; Torrez 36 months;

         25      Pedro Miranda 72 months.          The 97 months here for Mr. Rivera is

          1      a fair and it is a reasonable sentence and it was one that will

          2      promote respect for the law and it was one that will protect

          3      the public from this defendant.

          4                     THE COURT:      All right, thank you.

          5                     First, I am not going to enter a variant sentence

          6      in this case.       I do not see any grounds for an

          7      outside-the-guidelines sentence.              If the incident that occurred

          8      in February '06 was as described by Mr. Donaldson, then perhaps

          9      the parents or anyone else who was present that has a claim

         10      against the Lowell Police Department under Section 1983, but to

         11      me it does not impact this sentence in any way.                The Court

         12      will, therefore, sentence within the guidelines.                I've already

         13      heard the government's recommendation for sentencing within the

         14      guidelines.      I'll hear Mr. Donaldson briefly if he wishes to

         15      address the Court.

         16                     MR. DONALDSON:       Your Honor, if your Honor would

         17      sentence him within reference to the advisory guidelines.

         18      Again I would ask your Honor to take into consideration the

         19      3553(a) considerations, your Honor, with respect to

         20      Mr. Rivera's -- his overall issues with respect to him as a

         21      person, your Honor.

         22                     But if we're just basically talking about the basic

         23      advisory guideline sentence, I would suggest, your Honor, that

         24      he be sentenced to the low range of the guidelines.                 And I

         25      believe that the low range is 78 months.              And I would ask for

                                                                                             32




          1      that to be also consistent with the similarly situated other

          2      defendants, your Honor.

          3                     I would also indicate that Mr. Torrado, who is also

          4      considered to be one of the larger scale but on the same level

          5      as Mr. Rivera, I believe that he got a five-year sentence.

          6      That was by a plea agreement, your Honor.              But the other

          7      individual, he got a 72-month sentence.              So I would suggest,

          8      your Honor, that he would be -- that he would be given a

          9      72-month sentence if your Honor was to go below -- if your

         10      Honor was to go below, but to give a 78 if you weren't willing

         11      to go below the sentence, your Honor.             I would also ask that he

         12      be given an opportunity to have credit for the drug program as

         13      well.

         14                     THE COURT:      All right.     Does the defendant wish to

         15      address the Court before sentence is imposed?

         16                     MR. DONALDSON:       He had indicated to me, your Honor,

         17      that he would like to address the Court.              His father and his

         18      wife also indicated that they would like to address the Court.

         19                     THE COURT:      Well, I'm not going to hear from the

         20      father and the wife.         I will hear from the defendant.

         21                     THE DEFENDANT:       I'd like to apologize to the

         22      government, the United States, and to society at large for the

         23      harm that I committed.         I apologize to my family for the bad

         24      times that I had them go through due to this situation, to ask

         25      you, your Honor, that my punishment would be as lenient as

          1      possible, not for me but for my children and my family, who we

          2      all need each other.         That will be all.       Thank you.

          3                     THE COURT:      Do counsel have any reason why sentence

          4      ought not to be imposed at this time?

          5                     MR. BLOOMER:       No, your Honor.

          6                     MR. DONALDSON:       Not at this time, your Honor.

          7                     THE COURT:      All right.     The government in its brief

          8      made a recommendation for a fine, Mr. Bloomer.                 Is there any

          9      evidence that the defendant has the ability to pay a fine?

         10                     MR. BLOOMER:       I leave that to the Court's

         11      discretion, your Honor.          At the time I wrote the sentencing

         12      memo, I'm sure I looked at the PSR in arriving at that.

         13                     THE COURT:      Well, I don't see a net worth that

         14      warrants it, Mr. Bloomer, unless you know something I don't.

         15                     MR. BLOOMER:       No, your Honor.      No.

         16                     THE COURT:      All right.     Please stand, Mr. Rivera.

         17                     It is never a pleasure to sentence anybody to

         18      incarceration, but the crime you committed deserves a severe

         19      punishment.      There will be people who will suffer other than

         20      you as a result of this sentence, but the person that you

         21      should blame for that is the one you see in the mirror, not

         22      anyone else.      Because any hardship that is caused to your

         23      family, your parents, your children, your wife has been caused

         24      by you, not by society, not by this Court, not by the

         25      government, not by anyone else but you.              The spreading of

                                                                                                34




          1      heroin in the Lowell and Fitchburg area is just as bad as if

          2      you had distributed poison to those people.                 Young people who

          3      become addicts have no choice in the matter.                You make them

          4      dependent on this drug.          You and anyone else that participate

          5      in conspiracies to distribute this drug deserve to get thrown

          6      in jail for a long period of time.

          7                     The only reason why I am going to not go to the

          8      high end of the guideline is because I think you have shown an

          9      ability when you apply yourself to be a decent human being and

         10      to conduct yourself in a way that could be productive.                   You

         11      apparently have had a good employment record for most of the

         12      last 10 or 12 years.         How you got involved in this or why you

         13      got involved is totally unclear and unexcusable.                 But this is

         14      the last clear chance you have.               You're going to go to jail for

         15      a long period of time, but you'll still be a young man when you

         16      get out.     You'll still have the opportunity to participate in

         17      the society and do something good for your family and for the

         18      people around you, but you're going to have a long time to

         19      think about it.       If you ever are in this court again on a

         20      similar charge, you will go to jail for the rest of your life.

         21      I hope you understand that.

         22                     Pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 and

         23      having considered the sentencing factors enumerated in Title 18

         24      of the United States Code Section 3553(a), it is the judgment

         25      of this Court that you, Reynaldo Rivera, are hereby committed

          1      to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons to be imprisoned for a

          2      term of 88 months.        This term consists of terms of 88 months on

          3      each count to be served concurrently.             The Court makes a

          4      judicial recommendation that you participate in the Bureau of

          5      Prisons' 500-hour residential drug abuse program.

          6                     Upon release from imprisonment, you shall be placed

          7      on supervised release for a term of four years.                 This term

          8      consists of terms of four years on each count, all such terms

          9      to run concurrently.         Within 72 hours of release from custody

         10      of the Bureau of Prisons, you shall report in person to the

         11      district to which you are released.

         12                     No fine is imposed based upon this Court's finding

         13      that you are unable to pay a fine and are unlikely to become

         14      able to pay a fine.

         15                     While on supervised release, you shall comply with

         16      the following terms and conditions:            First, you shall not

         17      commit another federal, state or local crime and shall not

         18      illegally possess a controlled substance.              Second, you shall

         19      refrain from any unlawful use of a controlled substance and

         20      submit to one drug test within 15 days of release from

         21      imprisonment and at least two periodic drug tests thereafter,

         22      not to exceed 50 tests per year as directed by the probation

         23      office.     Third, you are to submit to the collection of a DNA

         24      sample as directed by the probation office.                 Fourth, you shall

          2      Section 5D1.3(c) and will be set forth in detail in the

          3      judgment and committal.

          4                     You are prohibited from possessing a firearm,

          5      destructive device or other dangerous weapon.               You are not to

          6      consume any alcoholic beverages.              You are to participate in a

          7      program for substance abuse counseling as directed by the

          8      United States probation office, which program may include

          9      testing, not to exceed 50 tests per year, to determine whether

         10      you have reverted to the use of alcohol or drugs.                You shall be

         11      required to contribute to the cost of services for such

         12      treatment based upon your ability to pay or the availability of

         13      third-party payment.

         14                     It is further ordered that you shall pay to the

         15      United States a special assessment of $600, which shall be due

         16      and payable immediately.

         17                     Mr. Rivera, you have a right to appeal this

         18      sentence.     If you choose to appeal, you must do so within ten

         19      days.    If you cannot afford an attorney, an attorney will be

         20      appointed on your behalf.

         21                     Do you understand that?

         22                     THE DEFENDANT:       Yes.

          4                       THE COURT:      I did say that, I believe.       Four years

          5      supervised release.

          6                       MR. BLOOMER:      Nothing further, your Honor.

          7                       MR. DONALDSON:      Your Honor, I have something.

          8                       THE COURT:      Yes, Mr. Donaldson.

          9                       MR. DONALDSON:      As part and parcel of Mr. Rivera's

         10      pretrial release, his family put their house up.                Do you

         11      want -- should I by motion request that the lien on the

         12      property be released?

         13                       THE COURT:      Yes, that is done by motion.        And the

         14      motion when it is properly filed will be allowed.

         15                       MR. DONALDSON:      Thank you, your Honor.

         16                       THE CLERK:      The defendant is remanded to custody of

         17      the U.S. Marshal.          All rise.

         18                       (Adjourned, 4:49 p.m.)
