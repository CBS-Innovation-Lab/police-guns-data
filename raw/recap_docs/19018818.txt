                     DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

           v.                           Criminal N o . 12-cr-131-01-JL

Vincent Lenza

                                O R D E R

      The assented to motion to reschedule jury trial (document n o .

12) filed by defendant is granted in part; the continuance is limited

to 30 days. Trial is continued to the two-week period beginning

February 5 , 2013, 9:30 a.m. In addition to various filing deadlines

contained in the local rules, the parties shall also file any in

limine motions no later than ten (10) days prior to the final pretrial

conference. Objections to motions in limine shall be filed no later

than three (3) days prior to the final pretrial conference.

      Defendant shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights within 10

days.   The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting

a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ' 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv), for the

reasons set forth in the motion.

      SO ORDERED.
