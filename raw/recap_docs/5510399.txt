              DEFENDANTâ€™S REQUEST FOR DOWNWARD DEPARTURE
                       ON GUIDELINE CALCULATIONS

        The defendant specifically states the guideline calculations overstate his Criminal History
as follows;

        Paragraph 59: the defendant should not have2 points added to his Criminal History for
committing the offense while under a criminal justice sentence. The offense which is referred to
was a possession of marijuana subsequent offense; the offense alleged possession only. The
defendant was still under that State court sentence because of a violation of probation which
apparently was lodged on 2/25/03 at which time the defendant appears to have defaulted. The
violation of probation in the State court was discharged after eventually being processed. The
defendant requests 2 points not be added to the Criminal History calculation.

        Paragraph 60: the defendant asserts 1 point should not be added to his calculation for
committing this offense less than 2 years following his release from custody. The defendant was
released from custody on 7/2/02 on a possession only of marijuana and receiving stolen motor
vehicle. The defendant states the offenses were relatively minor and he was within 6 months of
this offense not being countable.

        General Overstatement Criminal History based upon Criminal Convictions: the
defendant asserts the charges which he received at the age of 17 causes Criminal History to be
significantly overstated. The defendant asserts the three 3 sets of charges he received at age 17
should not be counted in the calculations due to the unfair overstatement. The cases involving the
possession with intent of marijuana were committed at a very young age. These cases total 6
points in the Criminal History calculation and cause the defendant to be catagorized as a career
offender. The defendant asserts a more realistic calculation of his history should exclude
counting these offenses due to his age and the nature of the offenses. In addition, the defendant
states classifying him as a career offender significantly overstates his history.

       The defendant states if the issues he raised relative to Criminal History are allowed by the
court he then would be a Criminal History Category III with 5 points.

       The defendant further states he should receive departures due the extraordinary efforts he
has made at rehabilitation as well as his extraordinary commitment and responsibility he has
shown to his family.

                                                     Respectfully submitted,
