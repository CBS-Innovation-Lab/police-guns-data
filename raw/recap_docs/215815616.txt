CASE CALLED FOR STATUS CONFERENCE.

   The government informed that additional discovery will be provided, and a
physical evidence inspection will be scheduled for any defense counsel who
wishes to attend.


   The defendants argued as to the FBI’s proceedings and requirements regarding the
evidence inspections. The government informed that they would notify defense counsel of
the procedures and if any change can be made. Defense counsel shall file, if needed, any
request that was not resolved between the parties for the Court’s consideration. The
defendants requested additional time to review all discovery and continue plea
negotiations.


   By October 31, 2022, attorney Ramon Gonzalez shall show cause why sanctions
should not be imposed for failure to appear at the status conference.



 Further Status Conference set for December 8, 2022 at 3:00 PM.

  The Speedy Trial Act tolled in the interest of justice and because of the need
for additional time to review and complete discovery and pursue plea
negotiations.
