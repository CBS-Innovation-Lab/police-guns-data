                  MEMORANDUM AND ORDER REGARDING
               PETITIONER’S MOTION FOR RESENTENCING
                           (Dkt. No. 15)

                          January 17, 2008
PONSOR, D.J.

    This petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 seeks a ruling

from this court on an issue that is currently before the

United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.                  See

Dkt. No. 21, Memorandum of January 9, 2008.

    During the conference on January 7, 2008, counsel for the

government indicated that a possibility existed that the
government     would   acknowledge     a    sentencing   error   in    its

submission to the First Circuit.             A recent status report,
filed January 11, 2008, confirms that the government will not
be pursuing this path, but will instead litigate the appeal.

    Based upon the duplication between this Petition and the
currently pending appeal, the court hereby DENIES Petitioner’s
Motion   for   Resentencing    (Dkt.       No.   15).    This   case   has

previously been closed, so it is not necessary to take any

further action. The status conference previously scheduled to
take place on February 8, 2008 at 2:00 p.m. is now off.               The

court, however, reiterates its willingness to accept a remand
from the First Circuit for a resentencing, if the Court of
Appeals should conclude that this is the proper approach.

    It is So Ordered.
