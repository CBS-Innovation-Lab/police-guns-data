           v.                           06-cr-198-01-JD

Christopher Hachey


                                O R D E R


      The assented to motion to reschedule jury trial (document no.

23) filed by defendant is granted.

      Defendant shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights within 10

days.   The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting

a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3131(h)(8)(B)(iv), for the

reasons set forth in the motion.

      SO ORDERED.
