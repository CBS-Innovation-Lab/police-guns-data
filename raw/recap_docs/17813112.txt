                                        ORDER

     On September 18, 2013, Luis Olivera filed a motion titled

“Request    for    a    Nunc    Pro   Tunc     for    Jail    Credit    Towards      My

Sentence” (ECF No. 125).          Therein, Mr. Olivera requested that he

receive credit for time served in relation to a state sentence

against the remainder of the federal sentence imposed by this

Court in February 2004.

     After reviewing the matter with the Office of the Probation

Officer,    this   Court       directed   the    Supervising         U.S.    Probation

Officer to send a letter to the Federal Bureau of Prisons (the

“BOP”) indicating that it was this Court’s intention that Mr.

Olivera’s state and federal sentences run concurrently.                        Such a

letter was sent on November 5, 2013.

     The    BOP    subsequently       informed       this    Court    that     it   had

received    a   similar     request     from    an    attorney       acting    on   Mr.

Olivera’s    behalf.        The   BOP     indicated     that    it     would    review

whether Mr. Olivera was eligible for the relief sought.                              In
  Case 1:03-cr-00070-S Document 126 Filed 11/12/13 Page 2 of 2 PageID #: 24



light   of   this   Court’s   mailing    of   the   letter   and   the   BOP’s

ongoing review of Mr. Olivera’s status, this Court DENIES AS

MOOT Mr. Olivera’s request for nunc pro tunc credit.

IT IS SO ORDERED.
