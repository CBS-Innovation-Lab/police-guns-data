         Plaintiff,

   [1] ANTONIO CRUZ-ARBOLEDA

         Defendant.


                          OPINION AND ORDER

        Pending before the Court is Defendant Antonio Cruz-

    Arboleda’s (“Defendant Cruz-Arboleda”) pro se petition for

    compassionate          release      pursuant       to     18     U.S.C.      §

    3582(c)(1)(A)(i) 1. See Docket No. 344. The              United        States


    1 In the instant petition, Defendant Cruz-Arboleda makes a cursory
    reference to home confinement by mentioning the memorandums issued
    by the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”) in March and April
    2020, which encouraged the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) to maximize the
    use of home confinement in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. See Docket
    No. 344 at pg. 2. While the Government’s Opposition asks the Court to
    deny what it understands to be Defendant Cruz-Arboleda’s request for
    home confinement, see Docket No. 359 at pgs. 3-5, the Court finds that,
    other than the brief mention of the DOJ memorandums, Defendant Cruz-
    Arboleda’s petition does not include a request to be placed in home
    confinement. And even if the Court were to construe the sprinkled
    references to home confinement in the petition as a request for such relief
    in light of the fact that “a document filed pro se is ‘to be liberally
    construed,’” see Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (internal citations
    omitted), the request would still fall short. The reason being that, while

    Government           (“Government”)            opposed         the      same

    (“Opposition”). See Docket No. 359. Having reviewed these

    submissions,       the    Court      hereby      DENIES        WITHOUT

    PREJUDICE Defendant Cruz-Arboleda’s petition at Docket

    Number 344.

        I. Analysis

        On October 15, 1996, Defendant Cruz-Arboleda was

    convicted by a jury of two counts of aiding and abetting in a

    carjacking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2119 (Counts I and III of

    the Indictment) and two counts of aiding and abetting in the

    use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence,

    in contravention of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (Counts II and IV of the

    Indictment). See Cruz-Arboleda v. U.S., Civil No. 16-2216 at


    the Court may recommend that an offender be placed in a particular
    facility or program, it does not have the authority to grant home
    confinement, for the BOP is the entity responsible for determining where
    an offender is placed. See 18 U.S.C.A. § 3621; Tapia v. United States, 564 U.S.
    319, 331 (2011) (stating that “[a] sentencing court can recommend that the
    BOP place an offender in a particular facility or program . . . [b]ut decision
    making authority rests with the BOP.”). Albeit the Court’s ability to issue
    such a recommendation to the BOP, Defendant Cruz-Arboleda’s petition
    is devoid of any reason that would propel this Court to issue such a
    recommendation at this juncture.

    Docket No. 19.2 On March 7, 1997, Defendant Cruz-Arboleda

    was sentenced to 15 years as to Count I, 5 years as to Count II,

    life imprisonment as to Count III and 20 years as to Count IV.

    Id. Judgment was entered that same day. See U.S. v. Cruz-

    Arboleda, Crim. No. 96-22 at Docket No. 99. Defendant Cruz-

    Arboleda is currently serving his life sentence at USP Terre

    Haute, a high security penitentiary. See Find an Inmate, FED.

    BUREAU      PRISONS,      https://www.bop.gov/inmateloc/           (last

    accessed May 13, 2021).

        In his petition, Defendant Cruz-Arboleda maintains that

    “extraordinary and compelling reasons” exist which warrant

    relief under § 3582(c)(1)(A)(i) due to the spread of COVID-19

    at USP Terre Haute and because he is reportedly at a high risk

    of contracting COVID-19 given that he suffers from asthma

    and is an HIV patient. See Docket No. 344 at pgs. 3-4.

        In its Opposition, the Government mounts a procedural

    challenge on the grounds that prior to filing the instant


    2The Court hereby refers to the Opinion and Order at Docket No. 19,
    entered in Defendant Cruz-Arboleda’s Civil Case No. 16-2216, in order to
    provide the relevant factual background in this matter given that a copy
    of the indictment, which dates back to 1995, is not available via CM/ECF.

    petition, Defendant Cruz-Arboleda failed to exhaust his

    administrative remedies as required by § 3582(c)(1)(A). See

    Docket No. 359. In the alternative, the Government avers that

    even if the Court were to find that Defendant Cruz-Arboleda

    exhausted his administrative remedies, his petition still fails

    on the merits. Id.

        This Court may entertain a petition pursuant to §

    3582(c)(1)(A) “upon motion of the Director of the Bureau of

    Prisons, or upon motion of the defendant after the defendant

    has fully exhausted all administrative rights to appeal a

    failure of the Bureau of Prisons to bring a motion on the

    defendant’s behalf” or, after 30-days have elapsed “from the

    receipt of such a request by the warden of the defendant’s

    facility, whichever is earlier[.]” See 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A).

    In his petition, Defendant Cruz-Arboleda does not specify

    whether he exhausted his administrative remedies prior to

    filing his request for compassionate release. 3


    3 The Court acknowledges that Defendant Cruz-Arboleda cites to a case
    from the District of Connecticut which supports the proposition that
    administrative exhaustion requirements may be waived. See Docket No.
    344 at pg. 4. This argument is not developed by Defendant Cruz-Arboleda

        For its part, the Government maintains that Defendant

    Cruz-Arboleda did not exhaust his administrative remedies

    prior to filing the instant petition, and as such, the same

    should be denied. See Docket No. 359 at pgs. 8-10. However,

    in its Opposition, the Government also informs this Court

    that, according to the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”), on May 20,

    2020, Defendant Cruz-Arboleda sought guidance to file a

    motion for compassionate release. See id. at pg. 10; see also

    Docket No. 359-1. This request was denied by way of a

    substantiated memorandum prepared with the assistance of

    the medical department at USP Terre Haute and signed by the

    warden. See Docket No. 359-2. Specifically, the memorandum

    went into detail as to why a motion for compassionate release

    would not be pursued on behalf of Defendant Cruz-Arboleda.

    Id. The memorandum also notified Defendant Cruz-Arboleda

    that if he disagreed with said determination, he could file an

    appeal pursuant to Bureau Program Statement 1330.18 within



    throughout his petition, and even if it were, the Court does not find that
    he has set forth sufficient reasons which would warrant waiving this
    procedural prerequisite.

    20 calendar days upon the date stated in the memorandum.

    Id. Notwithstanding Defendant Cruz-Arboleda’s apparent

    attempt to exhaust his administrative remedies, in view of the

    documents presented in support of the submissions currently

    before this Court, the fact remains that at the time that he filed

    the instant petition, he had not exhausted his administrative

    remedies. 4

        But even assuming arguendo that Defendant Cruz-

    Arboleda satisfied the statutory prerequisite under §

    3582(c)(1)(A), his petition still fails on the merits, for it does


    4 A review of the procedural timeline surrounding the filing of the instant
    petition confirms as much. Defendant Cruz-Arboleda’s petition states that
    the same was signed on April 26, 2020. See Docket No. 344 at pg. 6.
    However, the post stamp indicates that the petition was mailed to this
    Court on May 26, 2020 and was ultimately received and filed by the Clerk
    of the Court on June 2, 2020. See Docket No. 344-1. Further, Defendant
    Cruz-Arboleda’s request for guidance to file a motion for compassionate
    release was not made until May 20, 2020. See Docket No. 359-1. Meaning
    that, even if the Court were to consider the June 2, 2020 date as a starting
    point, Defendant Cruz-Arboleda still failed to comply with the strictures
    set forth by § 3582(c)(1)(A), for 30 days had yet to elapse from the receipt
    of the May 20, 2020 request by the warden and he had yet to receive a
    denial of said request. Therefore, even when using June 2, 2020 as the
    filing date for the instant petition and considering the May 20, 2020
    request for guidance, Defendant Cruz-Arboleda still failed to exhaust his
    administrative remedies prior to the filing of the instant petition.

    not specify extraordinary and compelling reasons that would

    warrant a sentence reduction under § 3582(c)(1)(A)(i). For

    starters, a look at the BOP website shows that on May 13, 2021,

    there were 0 confirmed cases of inmates and 0 staff members

    who have tested positive for COVID-19 at USP Terre Haute.

    See      COVID-19         Cases,     FED.      BUREAU        PRISONS,

    https://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/ (last updated May 13,

    2021). As such, it appears that the spread of COVID-19 at the

    aforementioned penitentiary is currently under control. 5

          As for his medical conditions, Defendant Cruz-Arboleda

    did not include with his petition a copy of any medical

    records that would confirm his claims regarding his HIV

    diagnosis or that he suffers from asthma. Further, at no point

    in his petition did he allege that he was not receiving

    treatment for his medical conditions or that his conditions

    have worsen due to lack of proper care. The only medical



    5 In its Opposition, the Government assures that, according to the BOP,
    Defendant Cruz-Arboleda has received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech
    COVID-19 vaccine on December 30, 2020 and January 20, 2021,
    respectively. See Docket No. 359 at pg. 13.

    records available to the Court in order to conduct its analysis

    were those proffered by the Government in its Opposition. See

    Docket No. 360-2. And while those records confirm that

    Defendant Cruz-Arboleda was diagnosed with HIV and

    suffers from asthma, they also happen to confirm that he is

    receiving medical attention for these conditions. 6 Id. The

    Court does not turn a blind eye to Defendant Cruz-Arboleda’s

    medical conditions, however, here, it appears that the same

    are being managed by the medical staff at the penitentiary.

        Lastly, the Court notes that, Defendant Cruz-Arboleda

    was convicted of a violent crime, is serving a life sentence in

    a high security penitentiary and has incurred in various

    disciplinary infractions while at the penitentiary, see Docket

    No. 360-3. Moreover, none of the sentencing factors under 18

    6For example, the notes from a medical exam performed on February 24,
    2021 state that an HIV viral load did not show the presence of the virus
    and that he is being treated with antiretroviral medication including
    Emtricitabine and Ritonavir. See Docket No. 360-2 at pgs. 1, 9.
    Furthermore, notes from a medical exam performed on October 29, 2020
    inform that Defendant Cruz-Arboleda was provided with an inhaler and
    additional medication to treat his asthma. Id. at pg. 8. The Court also
    points out that Defendant Cruz-Arboleda suffers from Hepatitis C. Id. at
    pg. 1. But the medical records confirm that he is also being treated by the
    medical staff for this condition. Id.

    U.S.C. § 3553(a) would support a reduction in sentence at this

    time. With this analysis in mind, the Court finds that,

    Defendant Cruz-Arboleda has not set forth “extraordinary

    and compelling reasons” that warrant relief under § 3582

    (c)(1)(A)(i).

        II. Conclusion

        In light of the above, Defendant Cruz-Arboleda’s petition

    at Docket No. 344 is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

        IT IS SO ORDERED.
