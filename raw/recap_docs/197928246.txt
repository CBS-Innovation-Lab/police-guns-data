      ORDER ON DEFENDANT DAPRATO’S MOTION TO SEVER AND
      DEFENDANT CANDELARIO’S MOTION TO SEVER OR EXCLUDE
                         EVIDENCE

       The indictment in this case (ECF No. 115) alleges that Defendants Jason

Candelario, Luis Carpio, Andrew Soboleski, and Derek Daprato engaged in a Hobbs

Act robbery conspiracy to violently steal marijuana and the proceeds of marijuana

sales, among other crimes. 1 During the investigation of the crime and immediately

following the execution of a search warrant for Soboleski’s DNA, Soboleski allegedly

told FBI agents that he dropped off Candelario and Carpio at the location of the crime,

that a person he thought was named Derek drove ahead of them, and that Soboleski

returned later to pick up Candelario and Carpio. Daprato moves (ECF No. 189) to

sever his case from that of his codefendants. Candelario also moves (ECF No. 191) to




 1  Count One charges all four defendants with conspiring to commit Hobbs Act robbery. See
18 U.S.C.A. § 1951(a) (West 2022). Count Two charges Candelario, Carpio, and Daprato with

sever his case or, alternatively, to exclude from evidence any statements made by any

codefendant.

       An indictment “may charge 2 or more defendants if they are alleged to have

participated in the same act or transaction, or in the same series of acts or

transactions, constituting an offense or offenses.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(b). But “[i]f the

joinder of . . . defendants in an indictment . . . appears to prejudice a defendant . . . ,

the court may . . . sever the defendants’ trials, or provide any other relief that justice

requires.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 14(a).

       Daprato argues that severance is required because Soboleski’s alleged

statement to the FBI incriminates Daprato and is admissible as to Soboleski (as his

own admission) but not against Daprato. As such, introducing the statement would

create a conflict between Daprato’s right to confront Soboleski and Soboleski’s right

to remain silent. Daprato also contends that the Government’s proposed redactions

of Soboleski’s statement are insufficient to avoid prejudice. Candelario makes the

same arguments, adding that, if severance is not granted, Soboleski’s statement and

all other statements made by Candelario’s codefendants should be excluded. Daprato

also argues that severance is necessary because he would be prejudiced by “spillover”

from the evidence admissible against his codefendants but not admissible against

him.

       I first address Daprato’s and Candelario’s Confrontation Clause arguments

and then turn to Daprato’s spillover argument.

                          I. CONFRONTATION CLAUSE

      “The general rule is that defendants who are properly joined in an indictment

should be tried together.” United States v. Floyd, 740 F.3d 22, 36 (1st Cir. 2014).

“This rule has special force in conspiracy cases, in which the severance of

coconspirators’ trials ‘will rarely, if ever, be required.’” Id. (quoting United States v.

Flores-Rivera, 56 F.3d 319, 325 (1st Cir. 1995)). Joint trials “promote efficiency and

‘serve the interests of justice by avoiding the scandal and inequity of inconsistent

verdicts.’” Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534, 537 (1993) (quoting Richardson v.

Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 210 (1987)). However, “a district court should grant a severance

under Rule 14 . . . if there is a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a

specific trial right of one of the defendants.” Id. at 539.

      The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal

defendant the right “to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” U.S. Const.

amend. VI. “The Supreme Court of the United States held in Bruton that a defendant

is deprived of that right ‘where the powerfully incriminating extrajudicial statements

of a codefendant . . . are deliberately spread before the jury in a joint trial’ and the

‘alleged accomplice does not testify and cannot be tested by cross-examination.’”

United States v. de Leon-De La Rosa, 17 F.4th 175, 190 (1st Cir. 2021) (alteration

omitted) (quoting Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 135-36 (1968)). But “the

Confrontation Clause is not violated by the admission of a nontestifying codefendant’s

confession with a proper limiting instruction when . . . the confession is redacted to

eliminate not only the defendant’s name, but any reference to his or her existence.”

Richardson, 481 U.S. at 211. That is true even when the redacted confession becomes

                                            3
Case 2:21-cr-00015-JDL Document 221 Filed 04/11/22 Page 4 of 13           PageID #: 515




incriminating “when linked with evidence introduced later at trial.” Id. at 208. Yet

a redacted confession violates the Confrontation Clause if it “‘obviously’ and ‘directly’

implicates the defendant in the crime” and would do so “even were the confession the

very first item introduced at trial.” de Leon-De La Rosa, 17 F.4th at 191 (quoting

Gray v. Maryland, 523 U.S. 185, 196 (1998)). Accordingly, “redactions that replace a

proper name with an obvious blank, the word ‘delete,’ a symbol, or similarly notify

the jury that a name has been deleted are similar enough to Bruton’s unredacted

confessions as to warrant the same legal results,” “for the jury will often realize that

the confession refers specifically to the defendant.” Gray, 523 U.S. at 193, 195.

      In sum, even a redacted pretrial confession cannot be introduced if it is

“powerfully incriminating,” meaning “inculpatory on its face,” either expressly or

because of its immediately obvious implication.        United States v. Vega Molina,

407 F.3d 511, 520-21 (1st Cir. 2005). As the First Circuit has acknowledged, “[t]his

criterion is easier to state than to apply.” Id. at 520. Whether proposed redactions

are sufficient “requires careful attention to both text and context, that is, to the text

of the statement itself and to the context in which it is proffered.” Id. However, the

context that a court may consider is limited: “Statements that are incriminating only

when linked to other evidence in the case do not trigger application of Bruton’s

preclusionary rule.” Id.

      In Vega Molina, the First Circuit approved a redacted confession that replaced

codefendants’ names with neutral phrases such as “other individuals” and “another

person.” Id. The court reasoned, however, that this method of redaction is not always

adequate. Id. “A particular case may involve numerous events and actors, such that

                                           4
Case 2:21-cr-00015-JDL Document 221 Filed 04/11/22 Page 5 of 13        PageID #: 516




no direct inference plausibly can be made that a neutral phrase like ‘another person’

refers to a specific codefendant.” Id. But “[a] different case may involve so few

defendants that the statement leaves little doubt in the listener’s mind about the

identity of ‘another person.’” Id. In Vega Molina, the redaction sufficed in part

because it referenced a deceased coconspirator. Id. at 521. That reference created

ambiguity about whether the codefendants were the individuals referenced in the

confession because it indicated that more people may have been involved in the crime

than those who were on trial. Id.

      Here, the Government proposes to redact Soboleski’s alleged statement by

referring to the codefendants as “individuals,” as shown in the following table

submitted by the Government:

      The Government argues that its responses and proposed redactions are

sufficient because of the redactions that the First Circuit endorsed in Vega Molina.

The Government also contends that it does not need to redact the reference to the

white pickup truck from statement seven because that detail does not facially

incriminate Daprato.

      Daprato counters that this case is different from Vega Molina because the

absence of references to additional parties will lead the jury to conclude that the

redacted statement must refer to Daprato, Candelario, and Carpio. Additionally,

Daprato asserts that mentioning the white pickup truck is akin to identifying

Daprato by a nickname, which would be prohibited. Finally, Daprato insists that,

because the Government intends to introduce the alleged statement through the

testimony of an FBI agent, redacting it would create artificial constraints on the

defendants’ cross-examinations and potentially cause a mistrial.

      Candelario likewise stresses the differences between this case and Vega

Molina, particularly the number of actors involved and the existence of other evidence

that would plainly link Candelario to the redacted statement. He argues that the

proposed redactions obviously imply that Soboleski named his codefendants because

the redacted statement contains unnatural phrases like “Soboleski was contacted by

one of two individuals, Soboleski was unable to recall which one.” Candelario also

asserts that the proposed redactions are unworkable because the defendants would

be unfairly prevented from fully cross-examining the testifying officer about topics

such as Soboleski’s exact words.



                                          7
Case 2:21-cr-00015-JDL Document 221 Filed 04/11/22 Page 8 of 13           PageID #: 519




      The reference to the white pickup truck could be incriminating when linked to

other evidence, but, if the alleged statement were the first piece of evidence at trial,

no juror would connect the truck to Daprato. “The Supreme Court has held that an

out-of-court confession of a non-testifying defendant that only ‘inferentially

incriminates’ a codefendant who is on trial through deductive links to other evidence

does not animate that codefendant’s Sixth Amendment concerns in the same manner

as a head-on accusation.” United States v. Padilla-Galarza, 990 F.3d 60, 76 (1st Cir.

2021) (alterations omitted) (quoting Richardson, 481 U.S. at 208); see also

Richardson, 481 U.S. at 209 (“If extended to confessions incriminating by connection,

. . . it is not even possible to predict the admissibility of a confession in advance of

trial.”). Only when a confession itself is powerfully incriminating, either directly or

through its immediately obvious implication, do we depart from “the almost

invariable assumption of the law that jurors follow their instructions.” Richardson,

481 U.S. at 206. “Where the necessity of . . . linkage is involved, it is a less valid

generalization that the jury will not likely obey the instruction to disregard the

evidence.” Id. at 208; accord United States v. Figueroa-Cartagena, 612 F.3d 69, 85

(1st Cir. 2010). There is no need to redact the reference to the white pickup truck if

the jury is instructed to consider the alleged statement only as to Soboleski.

      Additionally, the Government’s proposal to refer to the codefendants as

“individuals” is not a prohibited “obvious indication of deletion.” Gray, 523 U.S. at

192. It is true that a redacted confession must resemble something that “might

actually have been said by a person admitting his own culpability in the charged

conspiracy while shielding the specific identit[ies] of his confederate[s].” United

                                           8
Case 2:21-cr-00015-JDL Document 221 Filed 04/11/22 Page 9 of 13           PageID #: 520




States v. Jass, 569 F.3d 47, 62 (2d Cir. 2009). The Government might violate that

rule if it were to introduce the proposed redactions as if they were Soboleski’s exact

words because the references to “individuals” could sound “suspiciously closer to the

speech of a prosecutor than that of a perpetrator.” United States v. Taylor, 745 F.3d

15, 29 (2d Cir. 2014). But the Government’s plan is instead to have an FBI agent

testify about what Soboleski allegedly said. A phrase like “Soboleski was contacted

by one of two individuals, Soboleski was unable to recall which one” does not obviously

betray the fact that Soboleski’s original alleged statement contained actual names if

it is clear that the testifying officer is paraphrasing.

       Nor is this a case “involv[ing] few actors and events, such that a . . . neutral

pronoun becomes transparent and leaves little doubt in the listener’s mind about the

identity of the person whose name has been removed.” Foxworth v. St. Amand,

570 F.3d 414, 433 (1st Cir. 2009). The indictment states that the four defendants

“conspired with each other and other persons.” ECF No. 115 at 1 (emphasis added).

Based on this information, the named defendants do not represent the full extent of

the alleged conspiracy. The alleged redacted statement indicates that Soboleski and

at least three others participated. With the proposed redactions, it is ambiguous

whether the person who originally contacted Soboleski in statement one was a

potential fifth participant. The scheme is not described so exhaustively that a listener

could confidently conclude that only those four or five people were involved. The

alleged statement does not even describe the interference with commerce by violence

or the discharge and brandishing of a firearm during a crime of violence that are

charged in the indictment, leaving open the prospect of additional actors during those

                                             9
Case 2:21-cr-00015-JDL Document 221 Filed 04/11/22 Page 10 of 13         PageID #: 521




events. To the contrary, the gist of Soboleski’s alleged statement is that he did not

grasp what was going on and saw very little. Given “the distinct possibility that

people besides those who were on trial may have been involved in the commission of

the crimes,” there would be no obvious and immediate inference that the unidentified

persons are Soboleski’s codefendants. Vega Molina, 407 F.3d at 521.

      Finally, although courts must remain sensitive to the potential pitfalls of

allowing an officer to testify about a redacted statement, see Bruton, 391 U.S. at 134

n.10; United States v. Jedi, 339 F. Supp. 3d 19, 24 (D.P.R. 2018), such an arrangement

is not unusual. In Vega-Molina, an FBI agent testified as to a redacted pretrial

confession. 407 F.3d at 518-19. The Confrontation Clause provides defendants with

“the right to conduct such cross-examination as is reasonably necessary to delineate

and present the defendant’s theory of defense.” Id. at 522. “So long as the trial court

affords the defendant a fair opportunity for effective cross-examination, it may

impose reasonable restrictions . . . .” Id. at 523. Daprato and Candelario have not

shown that they would be deprived of a fair opportunity for effective cross-

examination if they are not permitted to ask the FBI agent questions that would

negate the redactions and thus create a Bruton problem.

      Finally, Candelario’s request to exclude all statements by his codefendants is

significantly overbroad, as certain statements by his codefendants may be admissible

against him or would be admissible against his codefendants without violating

Bruton. See Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) (providing that a statement “made by the

party’s coconspirator during and in furtherance of the conspiracy” is not hearsay);

Figueroa-Cartagena, 612 F.3d at 85 (“Because it is premised on the Confrontation

                                          10

Clause, the Bruton rule, like the Confrontation Clause itself, does not apply to

nontestimonial statements.” (quoting United States v. Johnson, 581 F.3d 320, 326

(6th Cir.2009))).

                                    II. SPILLOVER

      “Evidentiary spillover occurs ‘where evidence establishing the guilt of one

defendant, but not admissable [sic] against the other, may create an atmosphere

clouding the jury’s ability to evaluate fairly the guilt or innocence of the latter.’”

United States v. Weadick, 15 F.4th 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2021) (alteration in original)

(quoting United States v. Perkins, 926 F.2d 1271, 1281 (1st Cir. 1991)).              An

impermissible spillover may occur “where the crimes of some defendants are more

horrific or better documented than the crimes of others.” United States v. Martínez,

994 F.3d 1, 15-16 (1st Cir. 2021) (quoting United States v. Innamorati, 996 F.2d 456,

469 (1st Cir. 1993)). “To prevail on an evidentiary spillover claim, the defendant must

prove ‘prejudice so pervasive that a miscarriage of justice looms.’” Weadick, 15 F.4th

at 16 (quoting United States v. Paz-Alvarez, 799 F.3d 12, 30 (1st Cir. 2015)).

      Daprato argues that severance is appropriate because evidence against his

codefendants—namely,       Soboleski’s   alleged   statement   and   evidence    of   his

codefendants’ alleged violent acts—will cloud the jury’s capacity to judge him fairly.

The first issue is properly addressed through the Bruton framework. Soboleski’s

alleged statement does not call for severance if it is properly redacted and a limiting

instruction is given to the jury.

      In addition, evidence of Daprato’s codefendants’ alleged violent conduct—e.g.,

the shooting, zip ties, and duct tape—would not prejudice Daprato such that a

miscarriage of justice looms. Daprato is charged in every count of the indictment

except for the counts against Candelario and Carpio for being felons in possession of

firearms and ammunition. Supra note 1. Accordingly, much, if not all of the evidence

that Daprato identifies is admissible against him. “Where evidence featuring one

defendant is independently admissible against a codefendant, the latter cannot

convincingly complain of an improper spillover effect.” United States v. O’Bryant, 998

F.2d 21, 26 (1st Cir. 1993). Further, the alleged conduct of his codefendants, while

grievous, is not so horrific that a jury could not be trusted to fairly evaluate Daprato

as an individual.

      Daprato also argues that the jury would be confused by the fact that Soboleski

is charged only in Count One (conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery), see note 1,

while Soboleski’s alleged level of participation exceeds Daprato’s. It is not clear why

this concern qualifies as a question of evidentiary spillover. It is also not apparent,

at this pretrial stage, whether Daprato is correct about his alleged level of culpability

as compared to Soboleski. Regardless, I am not persuaded that such a discrepancy

in the Government’s charging decisions would confuse the jury and thus significantly

prejudice Daprato.

                                 III. CONCLUSION

      Derek Daprato’s Motion to Sever (ECF No. 189) and Jason Candelario’s Motion

to Sever or Exclude Evidence (ECF No. 191) are DENIED.
