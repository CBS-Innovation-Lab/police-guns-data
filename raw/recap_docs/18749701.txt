                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE




United States of America

     v.                                   Case No. 05-cr-138-01-PB

Jamison Mims



                                  O R D E R


     The defendant has moved to continue the October 4, 2005

trial in the above case, citing the need for additional time

complete discovery and prepare a defense.           The government does

not object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, in order to allow the parties additional time

complete discovery and properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from October 4, 2005 to February 7, 2006.             In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
