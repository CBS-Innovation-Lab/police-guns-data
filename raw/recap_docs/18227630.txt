                Respondent                        )

               RECOMMENDED DECISION ON MOTION TO AMEND1

        In this action, Petitioner Raymond L. Ellis, Jr., moves, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255,

to vacate, set aside or correct his sentence. (Motion, ECF No. 59.) Following a guilty plea,

Petitioner was convicted of theft of firearms from a federal firearms licensee, conspiracy

to commit theft, and possession of firearms as a convicted felon. (Judgment, ECF No. 29

at 1; Information, ECF No. 5.) The Court sentenced Petitioner to a total of 120 months in

prison. (Judgment at 2.) In 2011, the First Circuit upheld the sentence on appeal. (United

States v. Ellis, No. 10-1052 (1st Cir. Mar. 17, 2011).)

        In November 2016, I determined that the section 2255 motion was untimely and

thus recommended the Court deny relief, dismiss the motion, and deny a certificate of

appealability. (Recommended Decision, ECF No. 72 at 2, 7.) Petitioner subsequently filed


1
  Although a motion to amend is within the magistrate judge’s authority, Maurice v. State Farm Mut. Auto.
Ins. Co., 235 F.3d 7, 9 n.2 (1st Cir. 2000), because the motion is directly related to, and was arguably filed
in response to, the recommended decision that I previously issued regarding Petitioner’s section 2255
motion (Recommended Decision, ECF No. 72), and particularly given that in its review of the interrelated
decisions the Court will determine whether Petitioner can proceed on his motion, I concluded that it was
appropriate to issue a recommended decision on the pending motion, to afford the Court, in the event a
party objects to this recommendation, the opportunity to apply the same standard of review to both
decisions.

a motion to amend to add a claim under Johnson v. United States, --- U.S. ---, 135 S. Ct.

2551 (2015). (Motion to Amend, ECF No. 73.) In the motion to amend, Petitioner asserts

that he is entitled to relief because the Court determined the sentencing guidelines range

based in part on a finding that two prior Maine burglaries qualified as prior crimes of

violence, pursuant to USSG § 2K2.1, and that under Johnson, the burglaries do not qualify

as a crime of violence. (Motion to Amend at 1-2; Reply, ECF No. 75 at 1; Sentencing Tr.,

ECF No. 52 at 5.) The Government objects to the motion to amend. (Response, ECF No.

74.)

       After review of Petitioner’s motion to amend, I recommend the Court deny the

motion to amend as futile. I further recommend the Court deny a certificate of

appealability.

                                       DISCUSSION

       Petitioner’s motion to amend is governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 15. See 28 U.S.C.

§ 2242 (habeas petitions “may be amended or supplemented as provided in the rules of

procedure applicable to civil actions”); Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings, Rule

12 (providing that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply, to the extent they are not

inconsistent with statutory provisions or the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings).

Because the motion to amend was not filed within 21 days of Petitioner’s section 2255

motion, and because the Government objects to the motion to amend, leave of court is

required. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). The Court may deny a motion to amend if the

amendment would be futile, i.e., if “the complaint, as amended, would fail to state a claim

upon which relief could be granted.” D’Agostino v. ev3, Inc., 845 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2016).

          Petitioner’s motion to amend seeks leave to assert a claim under Johnson.

In Johnson, the Supreme Court “struck down the ‘residual clause’ of the [Armed Career

Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e) (ACCA)] as unconstitutionally vague.”2 Pakala v. United

States, 804 F.3d 139, 139 (1st Cir. 2015) (per curiam).                              In Welch v. United

States, --- U.S. ---, 136 S. Ct. 1257, 1268 (2016), the Supreme Court held that “Johnson

announced a substantive rule that has retroactive effect in cases on collateral review.”

Petitioner maintains he is entitled to relief under Johnson because two Maine burglary

convictions used by the Court to enhance his sentence pursuant to USSG § 2K2.1(a)(1) are

no longer violent crimes.3


2
    In Johnson, --- U.S. ---, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015), the Supreme Court explained:

          Federal law forbids certain people—such as convicted felons, persons committed to mental
          institutions, and drug users—to ship, possess, and receive firearms. [18 U.S.C. § 922(g)].
          In general, the law punishes violation of this ban by up to 10 years’ imprisonment.
          [18 U.S.C. § 924(a)(2)]. But if the violator has three or more earlier convictions for a
          “serious drug offense” or a “violent felony,” the Armed Career Criminal Act increases his
          prison term to a minimum of 15 years and a maximum of life. § 924(e)(1); Johnson v.
          United States, 559 U.S. 133, 136, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010). The Act defines
          “violent felony” as follows:

          “any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year . . . that—

          “(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against
          the person of another; or

          “(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves
          conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.” § 924(e)(2)(B)
          (emphasis added).

          The closing words of this definition, italicized above, have come to be known as the Act's
          residual clause.

135 S. Ct. at 2555-56. The Court held that the residual clause is unconstitutionally vague. Id. at 2557.
3
 At Petitioner’s sentencing, the Court determined, consistent with the revised presentence investigation
report, that an enhanced base offense level of 26 applied, pursuant to USSG § 2K2.1(a)(1), based in part on
Petitioner’s two prior Maine burglary convictions. (Sentencing Tr., ECF No. 52 at 5, 60.)

                                                       3

        Significantly, in Johnson, the Supreme Court explicitly limited its holding to

exclude claims based on “the four enumerated offenses, or the remainder of the Act’s

definition of a violent felony.” 135 S. Ct. at 2563. Burglary is one of the offenses

enumerated in section 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) of the ACCA. Thus, in Dimott v. United States,

Nos. 2:06-cr-26-GZS, 2:16-cv-347-GZS, 2016 WL 6068114, at *2, 2016 U.S. Dist. Lexis

142354, at *5 (D. Me. Oct. 14, 2016), this Court held that because the petitioner’s multiple

prior Maine burglary convictions resulted in an enhanced sentence under the enumerated



        Section 2K2.1(a)(1) applies

        if (A) the offense involved a (i) semiautomatic firearm that is capable of accepting a large
        capacity magazine; or (ii) firearm that is described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a); and (B) the
        defendant committed any part of the instant offense subsequent to sustaining at least two
        felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.

USSG § 2K2.1(a)(1). Application Note 1 of the Commentary to USSG § 2K2.1 provides that the term
“crime of violence” has the same meaning as in section 4B1.2(a) and Application Note 1 of the Commentary
to USSG § 4B1.2. Section 4B1.2(a) provided at the time of Petitioner’s sentencing:

        The term “crime of violence” means any offense under federal or state law, punishable by
        imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that –

        (1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against
            the person of another, or

        (2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or
            otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury
            to another.

USSG § 4B1.2(a). Section 4B1.2(a) was amended following Johnson v. United States, --- U.S. ---, 135 S.
Ct. 2551 (2015). USSG Supp. to App. C, amend. 798 (Aug. 1, 2016). “Burglary of a dwelling” is not in
the current version of section 4B1.2(a). However, the amendment does not apply to Petitioner’s case
because it was not in effect on the date of his sentencing. See USSG § 1B1.11; United States v.
Johnson, --- F. App’x ---, ---, 2016 WL 6775916, at *4, 2016 U.S. App. Lexis 20525, at *11 (11th Cir.
Nov. 16, 2016) (noting that Amendment 798 involves a substantive change that does not apply
retroactively); Tosi v. United States, No. 2:16-cv-05-GZS, 2016 WL 5107078, at *2 & n.4, 2016 U.S. Dist.
Lexis 127760, at *4 & n.4 (D. Me. Sept. 20, 2016) (discussing Amendment 798). In Tosi, an assented-to
motion to dismiss the appeal, based on Beckles, is pending in the First Circuit. (Tosi v. United States, No.
16-2225.)

offense clause of section 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), rather than the residual clause of the statute,

Johnson and Welch do not provide grounds for relief. If Johnson applied to sentences

enhanced under the guidelines and was not limited to ACCA sentences, under this Court’s

reasoning in Dimott, Petitioner nonetheless would not be entitled to relief under Johnson,

because the sentencing range was determined under the enumerated offenses clause, not

the residual clause, of the guidelines.4

        Johnson, however, does not apply to sentences enhanced under the guidelines. In

Beckles v. United States, No. 15-8544, --- U.S. ---, 2017 WL 855781, 2017 U.S. Lexis 1572

(Mar. 6, 2017), the Supreme Court recently held that “the advisory Guidelines are not

subject to vagueness challenges under the Due Process Clause . . . .” 2017 WL 855781,

at *3, 2017 U.S. Lexis 1572, at *6. The Supreme Court thus rejected the petitioner’s

argument that the guidelines residual clause, like the statutory residual clause at issue in

Johnson, is unconstitutionally vague. Id. Because Petitioner’s sentence was enhanced

under the guidelines and was not an ACCA sentence, Beckles precludes Petitioner’s claim.



4
  Had the claim set forth in Petitioner’s motion to amend presented an issue under Johnson, the claim
nevertheless would have been untimely, because Petitioner filed it in December 2016, i.e., more than one
year after the Supreme Court’s June 26, 2015, decision in Johnson, and Petitioner asserts no appropriate
basis for equitable tolling. See 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f)(3) (providing a one-year limitation period that runs
from “the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has
been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral
review”); Ramos-Martínez v. United States, 638 F.3d 315, 322 (1st Cir. 2011) (holding that “section
2255(f)’s one-year limitations period is subject to equitable tolling in appropriate circumstances”). In
addition, because the recommended decision concludes that Petitioner’s original section 2255 motion was
untimely (Recommended Decision at 2, 7), the proposed amendment may not relate back under Fed. R.
Civ. P. 15(c), i.e., the amendment may not be considered timely based on the date of filing of the original
claim. See Krupski v. Costa Crociere S. p. A., 560 U.S. 538, 541 (2010) (noting that “Rule 15(c) of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governs when an amended pleading ‘relates back’ to the date of a timely
filed original pleading”).

        Petitioner also cites Mathis v. United States, --- U.S. ---, 136 S. Ct. 2243 (2016), in

support of his claim.5 Mathis is not applicable to Petitioner’s section 2255 motion because

Mathis “has not been recognized as a case that announced a new substantive rule that is

retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review,” and it therefore “cannot be read as

triggering a new one-year period for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f)(3).” Dimott,

2016 WL 6068114, at *3, 2016 U.S. Dist. Lexis 142354, at *6-7; see Mathis, 136 S. Ct. at

2251-52 (noting that the Court’s prior precedent, including Descamps v. United

States, --- U.S. ---, 133 S. Ct. 2276, 2283 (2013), indicated the rule was not new); United

States v. Taylor, --- F. App’x ---, 2016 WL 7093905, at *4, 2016 U.S. App. Lexis 21701,

at *12 (10th Cir. Dec. 6, 2016) (concluding that “Mathis did not announce a new rule,” and

citing, inter alia, Dimott, 2016 WL 6068114, at *3, 2016 U.S. Dist. Lexis 142354, at *6-7).

Because Mathis is not retroactively applicable, Petitioner could not recover on a claim

based on Mathis.6


5
 Mathis v. United States, --- U.S. ---, 136 S. Ct. 2243 (2016), is one of a line of cases involving the statutory
interpretation of the term “burglary” and other enumerated offenses, as used in the Armed Career Criminal
Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e). See Mathis, 136 S. Ct. at 2247-50; Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S.
13, 23 (2005) (“We are, after all, dealing with an issue of statutory interpretation.”) (citing Taylor v. United
States, 495 U.S. 575, 602 (1990)). In Mathis, the Supreme Court recognized the long-standing rule that a
prior conviction will not qualify as an ACCA predicate unless “its elements are the same as, or narrower
than, those of the generic offense.” 136 S. Ct. at 2247. The Court held that the inclusion of land, water or
air vehicles, as well as buildings and structures, in Iowa’s burglary statute rendered the “locational element”
of the crime broader than generic burglary, which includes only buildings and structures. Id. at 2250. The
Supreme Court held that the Eighth Circuit erred when it affirmed the district court’s use of a modified
categorical approach, which had permitted a review of the record to determine the location where the
burglary took place, because under the ACCA, “it is impermissible for ‘a particular crime [to] sometimes
count towards enhancement and sometimes not, depending on the facts of the case.’” Id. at 2250-51
(quoting Taylor, 495 U.S. at 601).
6
 Because Petitioner’s claim is based on the Court’s guidelines determinations, rather than the ACCA, given
the Beckles decision, the argument made by the petitioners in three cases now pending before the First
Circuit – that Johnson opened the door to challenge an ACCA sentence - is not available to Petitioner. The
appeals followed this Court’s decisions in Dimott v. United States, Nos. 2:06-cr-26-GZS, 2:16-cv-347-GZS,

                                                       6

                                            CONCLUSION

        Based on the foregoing analysis, I recommend the Court deny Petitioner’s request

for leave to amend his section 2255 motion. I further recommend that the Court deny a

certificate of appealability pursuant to Rule 11 of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Cases

because there is no substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right within the

meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).
