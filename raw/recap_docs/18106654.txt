MEMORANDUM AND oRDER

Before the Court are Damien Gouse’s motions for a new trial pursuant to
Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (ECF No. 84) and his motion
under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence ECF No. 85.
Mr. Gouse asks the Court to grant him a new trial, or, alternatively, to vacate his
sentence due to errors of law and ineffective assistance of counsel both at the trial
and appellate levels. The Court finds no merit to either of Mr. Gouse’s motions and
thus they are DENIED.
I. FACTS

Providence Police stopped Mr. Gouse’s car in November of 2007 . The police
found a handgun and a bag of suspected narcotics in the car. Mr. Gouse was
indicted by the federal government for being a felon in possession of a firearm,
under 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(§)(1) and 924(e)(1).1 The parties stipulated that Mr. Gouse
had a prior felony on his record such that evidence of the first element of the crime

_ being a felon in possession of a firearm ~ was not put before the jury. ECF No.

 

1 The latter statute is commonly called the Armed Career Criminal Act (“the
ACCA”), Which creates an enhanced mandatory minimum penalty When a
defendant has three or more prior Violent felonies.

 

Case 1:11-cr-00112-I\/|-PAS Document 89 Filed 06/29/16 Page 2 of 11 Page|D #: 1599

73 at 42~43. The case went to trial and a jury found Mr. Gouse guilty of being a
felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1). ECF No. 52.
In the course of litigation, the Government chose not to press for the enhanced
penalty of fifteen years that is available under the ACCA. The Court subsequently
imposed a sentence of 120 months incarceration,2 followed by three years of
supervised release, according to the default penalty provision in 18 U.S.C.
§ 924(a)(2)3, which applies to the criminal statute that Mr. Gouse was convicted of
violatingl ECF No. 62.

Mr. Gouse appealed to the First Circuit Court of Appeals on a single issue,
arguing a violation of the lnterstate Agreernent on Detainers (IAD), which was
denied. Um'ted States V. Gouse, 798 F.3d 39 (1st Cir. 2015). He next sought
certiorari in the United States Supreme Court, which was also denied. Um'ted
States V. Gouse, 136 S.Ct. 283 (2015). He now brings the instant motions pursuant
to Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for a new trial, and 28 U.S.C.
§ 2255 to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence
Il. ANALYSIS OF RULE 33 CLAIM

Rule 33 states that upon defendant’s motion, “the court may vacate any
judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.” Fed. R. Crirn.

P. 33(a). A motion grounded on any reason other than newly discovered evidence

 

2 The sentencing guideline range for Mr. Gouse was 140'175 months, but the
statutory maximum Was 120 months

3 Title 18 U.S.C. § 924(a)(2) providesf (a) Except as otherwise provided in this
subsection... (2) Whoever knowingly violates subsection (a)(€), (d), (g), (h), (i), (]'), or
(o) of section 922 shall be fined as provided in this title, imprisoned not more than
10 years, or both.

 

Case 1:11-cr-00112-I\/|-PAS Document 89 Filed 06/29/16 Page 3 of 11 Page|D #: 1600

must be filed within fourteen days of the Verdict of guilty. Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(b)(2).
A defendant arguing for a new trial based on discovery of new evidence, however,
has three years from the verdict. Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(b)(1). rl‘he fourteen day limit
would bar a Rule 33 motion in this case, therefore, unless Mi'. Gouse can show that
the discovery of new evidence and the interest of justice require the Court to vacate
judgment and order a new trial, See jd. He cannot, and thus his motion for a new
trial fails.

The First Circuit adheres to a well-established foui"pronged test, sometimes
referred to as the “Wright test,” to evaluate requests for new trial on the basis of
newly discovered evidence. Um`ted States V. Montj]]a'f€jveia, 115 F.Bd 1060, 1064'
65 (lst Cir. 1997); Uni'ted States V. Li/'H'g]it, 625 F.2d 1017 (1st Cir. 1980). The four
factors arei (i) that evidence was unknown or unavailable at time of trial despite (ii)
due diligence, and that (iii) the evidence was material, not merely cumulative or
impeaching, and that (iv) the evidence would likely result in an acquittal upon
retrial Um`ted States V. Natane], 938 F.2d 302, 313 (1st Cir. 1991). For each
prong, the defendant carries the burden of proof. See ]V[OIitj]]a'Rji/ei'a, 115 F.3d at
1064'65; Wi'jg}it, 625 F.2d at 1019. Courts in the First Circuit have no discretion to
grant a new trial if any one of these four factors is missing. See Natane], 938 F.2d
at 313.

Mr. Gouse, in his affidavit and memorandum filed in support of this motion,
offers very little that _ even when liberally construed _ could be considered newly

discovered evidence Mr. Gouse contends that his indictment, trial, conviction, and

 

Case 1:11-cr-00112-|\/|-PAS Document 89 Filed 06/29/16 Page 4 of 11 Page|D #: 1601

sentencing were improper,4 but the only newly discovered evidence he cites is a
conversation he had with an “inmate law clerk” who told Mr. Gouse, presumably
after reviewing his case, that he has “seen some ugly mistakes from the courts, but
this is one of the uglier ones . . . .” ECF No. 84 at 2. Applying the Wright test to
this statement, the Court finds that Mr. Gouse has failed in his burden. First, a
conversation with a fellow inmate about whether mistakes were made in his
indictment, trial, conviction, or sentence hardly qualifies as evidence as to his
factual innocence Even if, aiguendo, the inmate’s opinion was “evidence,” by
Mr. Gouse’s own admission, the basis for the opinion, i.e. the details of the
indictment, trial, conviction, and sentence, were readily known and available at the
time of trial, ECF No. 84 at 1'2. Although it is not necessary to address all four
components of the test to disqualify the potential evidence, see Natane], 938 F.2d at
313, the “evidence” was not material to the case. The inmate’s opinion was, at inost,
an impeachment of the Court and Mr. Gouse’s lawyer. Finally, the “evidence” in the
form of an inmate’s opinion was not remotely likely to result in acquittal at retrial.
Therefore, because the Court finds that Mr. Gouse has failed in his burden to
show that there is newly discovered evidence justifying a new trial under Rule 33,

his motion is DENIED.

 

4 The analysis of those procedural questions is treated more fully below in section

lll.

IlI. ANALYSIS OF § 2255 CLA,IM

The core of Mr. Gouse’s claim for relief under § 2255 is that his sentence was
illegal due to the prosecutor’s misconduct in committing procedural errors iii the
indictment and the Court’s errors at sentencing He also claims ineffective
assistance of counsel at both the trial level, for not raising the alleged errors to the
Court, and at the appellate level, for failing to communicate with him on strategy,
and failing to raise the same alleged errors. The Court will begin with a brief
primer on the standard of review on § 2255 motions before analyzing Mr. Gouse’s
claims

Generally, the grounds justifying post-conviction relief under § 2255 are
limited A court may grant relief pursuant to § 2255 in instances where the
sentencing court lacked jurisdiction, committed a constitutional error, or if the
sentence is otherwise subject to collateral attack. Uni'ted States V. Addonjzib, 442
U.S. 178, 185 (1979). Such collateral attacks require the petitioner to demonstrate
“exceptional circumstances” that warrant redress under § 2255. See Hj]] V, Um'ted
States, 368 U.S. 424, 428 (1962). 'l`his might include an error of law, but only when
“the claimed error constituted a fundamental defect which inherently results in a
complete miscarriage of justice .” Addom`zi'o, 442 U.S. at 185 (internal quotation and
citation omitted).

A. Claims Based on Errors of Law

Mr. Gouse argues that he should not have been sentenced under § 924(a)(2)

because he was not indicted for violating it and the jury did not find him guilty of it.

 

Case 1:11-cr-00112-|\/|-PAS Document 89 Filed 06/29/16 Page 6 of 11 Page|D #: 1603

ECF No. 86 at 7 . Further, he mistakenly claims that he was found guilty of being
an armed career criminal under § 924(€)(1). Id. Thus, he illogically asserts the
verdict was legally and procedurally in error and the Court erred in imposing the
ten year sentence instead of sentencing in accordance with the ACCA.

These perceived errors do not amount to fundamental defects There are two
major flaws in Mr. Gouse’s argument. The first flaw in his argument on the faulty
indictment and conviction involves a misperception of the distinct roles of judge and
jury in a criminal proceeding lt is the function of the jury to act as fact‘finder,
determining witness credibility and weighing evidence, then applying the law as the
Court instructs S]iannon V. Unjted States, 512 U.S. 573, 579 (1994). If the jury
makes a determination of guilt, it is the Court’s province to sentence the offender
within the prescribed limitations and according to the dictates of justice. [d. As
such, the jury made no finding with respect to the applicable penalty provision
According to this well'established division of labor, the jury found Mr. Gouse guilty
of violating 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), the criminal statute he was indicted under, and
the Court properly sentenced him according to § 924(21)(2), the particular sentencing
provision that applied to the statute he violated. See S}ia_nnon, 512 U.S. 579. The
Court finds no error here.

The second flaw is that Mr. Gouse was not found guilty of being an armed
career criminal, but for being a felon in possession of a firearm. ECF No. 52. The
indictment merely cited 18 U.S.C. 924(e)(1) (the ACCA) to give notice to Mr. Gouse

of the potential period of incarceration he could face if successfully prosecuted under

 

Case 1:11-cr-00112-|\/|-PAS Document 89 Filed 06/29/16 Page 7 of 11 Page|D #: 1604

it. lt was a sufficient indictment, therefore, since it provided him with a reasonable
certainty as to the nature of the charge against him, and enabled him to prepare an
adequate defensel See, e.g., Uni'ted States v. Hui']ey, 63 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1995)
(quoting Ham]j_rig V. Um'ted States, 418 U.S. 87, 117 (1974)). l\/loreover, the ACCA
reference became irrelevant because the Government did not attempt to prove the
required three violent felonies, and the jury was never asked to make a finding as to
Mr. Gouse’s career criminal status.5

Mr. Gouse was indicted for the felon in possession charge, knew the potential
penalties he faced, proceeded to trial on the single charge based on the parties’
agreement to not present the ACCA violation to the jury, and was convicted. Even
if Mr. Gouse is correct that the Court erred in sentencing there is no plausible
argument that this defect amounts to a complete miscarriage of justice. The Court
sentenced him to ten years under the default provision (28 U.S.C. § 924(a)(2)), not
under the ACCA, which would have increased his sentence to fifteen years The
Court set the sentence to run concurrently to a sentence imposed by the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, thereby further reducing his overall
incarceration time. lt would be a paradoxical position indeed if l\/lr. Gouse were to
assert that by receiving a significantly more lenient sentence, he is in fact the
victim of procedural or legal errors Therefore, Mr. Gouse’s adjudication neither

contained fundamental defects not resulted in a complete miscarriage ofjustice.

 

5 Govei'nment’s Exhibit 6 and the jury trial transcripts memorialize the stipulation
between the parties that Mr. Gouse had a prior felony for purposes of the felon in
possession charge at trial in exchange for not pressing the ACCA charge ECF No.
73 at 42~43.

 

Case 1:11-cr-00112-|\/|-PAS Document 89 Filed 06/29/16 Page 8 of 11 Page|D #: 1605

B. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel

Mr. Gouse’s next claim for relief is that his counsel at both the trial court and
appellate levels were ineffective such that his constitutional rights were violated.
“The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the right to effective
assistance of counsel.” Le_ma v. Um`ted States, 987 F.2d 48, 51 (1st Cir. 1993) (citing
Stri'c]dana' V. Was}ijngton, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984)). The performance standard
guaranteed by the Constitution is “that of reasonably effective assistance under the
circumstances then obtaining.” Natane], 938 F.2d at 310. To demonstrate that he
was deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel,
Mr. Gouse must show boch 1) that his counsel’s performance fell below an objective
standard of reasonableness; and 2) a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s
unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different
Sti'i`ck]and, 466 U.S. at 687'88, 694. The standard of judicial scrutiny on such a
claim is highly deferential in favor of counsel’s performance of their duties Id. at
689. Sti'jck]and asserts that the court “must indulge a strong presumption that
counsel’s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance;
that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the
circumstances the challenged action ‘might be considered sound trial strategy.”’ Ia’.
(quoting _Mi`che] v. Loujsjana, 350 U.S. 91, 101 (1955)). Furtherinore, “[aln error by
counsel, even if professionally unreasonable, does not warrant setting aside the
judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on the judgment.” Id. at

691.

 

Case 1:11-cr-00112-|\/|-PAS Document 89 Filed 06/29/16 Page 9 of 11 Page|D #: 1606

In light of this standai'd, the Court examines Mr. Gouse’s claims of ineffective
assistance with the representation that Mr. Gouse received. l\/Ir. Gouse faults his
trial counsel for failing to object to the Presentencing Report (PSR), sentence, or
indictment ECF No. 86 at 5'6. The record indicates othei‘wise. Significantly, at
the sentencing hearing Mr. Gouse responded affirmatively when asked whether he
had reviewed the PSR with his attorney and indicated that he had no questions or
issues at that time. ECF No. 74 at 2‘3. ln addition, the docket reflects that his trial
attorney filed numerous motions6 made appropriate arguments before the Court,
produced exhibits, and professionally examined witnesses at trial on Mr. Gouse’s
behalf. Given the deferential standard with which the Court must view counsel’s
conduct, the challenged actions here can be considered sound trial strategy, falling
within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance See Sti'jck]and, 466
U.S. at 689. The Court finds that Mr. Gouse has failed under the Stiv'c]dand
objective test to show that his trial attorney’s performance fell below an objective
standard of reasonableness

Mr. Gouse next argues, with some vehenience, that his appellate attorney
violated his Sixth Amendment rights by failing to communicate with him about his
appeal and failing to raise his sentencing indictment, and ineffective assistance of
trial counsel errors ECF No. 86 at 5'6. He excoriates his attorney for not taking
his calls, returning his letters, or communicating with him in other respects Id.

Essentially, Mr. Gouse argues that the outcome of his appeal would have been

 

6 See ECF Nos. 6, 13, 17, 18, 21, 33, 35, 36, 41, 43, 57, and 63.
9

 

Case 1:11-cr-00112-|\/|-PAS Document 89 Filed 06/29/16 Page 10 of 11 Page|D #: 1607

different if his counsel had listened to him and followed up on the points of error he
perceived both pretrial and at trial. But, because both this Court and the First
Circuit Court of Appeals have already rejected many if not all of those perceived
errors, the Court cannot now determine that Mr. Gouse’s appellate counsel’s
strategy was unreasonable or rose to the level of unprofessional erroi'. Cf.` Buccj V.
Um`ted States, 662 F.3d 18, 31 (1st Cir. 2011) (holding that counsel must balance
limited time, energy, or financial resources in accord with effective trial tactics and
strategic s).

“l'l`lhe Constitution pledges to an accused an effective defense, not necessarily
a perfect defense or a successful defense.” Scaipa v. Duboi'e, 38 F.Sd 1, 8 (1st Cir.
1994). l\/loreover, in light of the Court’s determination that Mr. Gouse has no
grounds to challenge his trial, sentencing and trial counsel’s representation, his
appellate attorney’s conduct was objectively reasonable and thus consistent with
the Sti'jc]dand test. Yet even assuming that Mr. Gouse could prove that his
appellate attorney was not objectively reasonable, in light of the Court’s review of
the record and consideration of all of Mr. Gouse’s claims for relief under Rule 33 and
§ 2255, it is not reasonably probable that, but for counsel’s errors, Mr. Gouse’s
results would have been different.
IV. CONCLUSION

The Court DENIES Mr. Gouse’s Motion for New Trial pursuant to Rule 33,
ECF No. 84. Additionally, the Court DENIES and DISMISSES the writ under

§ 2255 for postconviction relief. ECF No. 85.
