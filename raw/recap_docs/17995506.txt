       No objections having been filed to the Magistrate Judge's Recommended Decision

(ECF No. 109) filed February 27, 2015, the Recommended Decision is AFFIRMED.

       Accordingly, it is ORDERED that no evidentiary hearing is warranted under Rule

8 of the Rules Government Section 2255 Cases.

       It is also ORDERED that Petitioner’s 28 U.S.C. §2255 Motion is DENIED. A

certificate of appealability is DENIED pursuant to Rule 11 of the Rules Governing Section

2255 because there is no substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right within

the meaning of 28 U.S.C. §2253(c)(2).
