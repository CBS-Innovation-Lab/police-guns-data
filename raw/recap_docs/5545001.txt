       DEFENDANT ALVIN CAMPBELL’S SENTENCING MEMORANDUM

       Now comes defendant ALVIN CAMPBELL, through counsel, and hereby submits this

Memorandum in preparation for his sentencing.


I.     Mr. Campbell’s Position Regarding his Guideline Sentencing Range, Without
       Reference to Departures

       As set forth in the Presentence Report (PSR), the Probation Officer has calculated the

Guideline Sentencing Range (GSR) to be 57 to 71 months. In arriving at this GSR, the Probation

Officer contends that pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(a)(4)(A), the base offense level (BOL)

attributable to Mr. Campbell is 20 since the defendant committed the instant offense subsequent to

sustaining a felony conviction for a crime of violence. The base offense level is then adjusted by

four (4) points based on the fact that Mr. Campbell possessed a firearm along with 171.03 grams of

marijuana (a felony for guideline purposes). Finally, three (3) levels are deducted for acceptance of

responsibility, thereby making the total offense level (TOL) 21.

       As this section addresses defendant’s position regarding his Guideline Sentencing Range

without reference to departures, Mr. Campbell agrees with the Probation Officer that with a total

offense level of 21, and a CHC of IV, his GSR is 57-71 months. Mr. Campbell renews his objection

to the use of Application Note 3(C) to U.S.S.G. § 5G1.3 in support of the position that Mr.
      Case 1:05-cr-10142-JLT          Document 35         Filed 10/26/2006       Page 2 of 7



Campbell’s federal sentence should be served consecutive to the state sentence currently being

served for a probation revocation (PSR ¶ 99). While it is true that the Sentencing Commission

recommends that the sentence for the instant offense be imposed consecutively to the sentence

imposed for the revocation, recommendations in the Application Notes were advisory even when

the Guidelines themselves were mandatory. In light of the fact that application of the Guidelines as

a whole is now advisory, the weight to be given to a recommendation in the Application Notes is

lessened even further. Mr. Campbell respectfully suggests that any sentence imposed in this case

should be served concurrent with the state sentence he is currently serving.



II.    Mr. Campbell Should Be Given a “Downward Departure” to Reduce Whatever
       Sentence is Imposed on Him by the Amount of Time Served Between July 21, 2005 (the
       Date of Defendant’s Arrest by Federal Authorities) until the Date of Sentencing

       It is Mr. Campbell’s position that a departure should be given to reduce whatever sentence

the Court imposes by the amount of time served between July 21, 2005 (the date of defendant’s

arrest by Federal authorities) until the date of sentencing. As grounds for this suggestion, defendant

states that he has been incarcerated since May 19, 2005 on a state probation violation (for which he

was sentenced to four to six years on March 3, 2006). Mr. Campbell’s arrest in this case – and the

pendency of this Indictment – was made know to and considered by the state judge who sentenced

him on the probation violation. Absent this probation violation and state incarceration, Mr.

Campbell would have been detained on the instant federal matter, and would be receiving credit

toward any sentence of imprisonment imposed by this Court. Therefore, Mr. Campbell respectfully

suggests that a departure should be granted to effectively “credit” him for this time served.



III.   Mr. Campbell’s Sentence After Consideration of the Factors Set Forth in 18 U.S.C. §
       3553(a)


       In recognition of the fact that the United States Sentencing Guidelines were rendered

“advisory” by the Supreme Court’s decision in United States v. Booker / United States v. Fanfan,

125 S.Ct. 738 (2005), defendant submits that a sentence lower than the Guideline Sentencing Range

(GSR) is appropriate when considering the factors the Court is directed to consider in imposing a

sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). Defendant therefore submits that a sentence of forty-five

(45) months1 is appropriate.

       Section 3553(a)(1) requires the Court to consider the nature and circumstances of the offense

and the history and characteristics of the defendant when imposing a sentence. It is worthwhile to

note that “when put side by side, the Guideline provisions and statutory provisions under section

3553(a) often contradict one another.” United States v. Myers, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1342 (S. D.

Iowa Jan. 26, 2005) (citing United States v. Ranum, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1338 (E.D. Wis. Jan 14.

2005)). For example, under the Guidelines, courts are generally prohibited from considering the

defendant’s age (§ 5H1.1), education and vocational skills (§ 5H1.2), socio-economic status (§

5H1.10), or lack of guidance as a youth (§ 5H1.12). Section 3553(a)(1), however, requires a Court


       1
           Defendant contends that the Court should “depart” downward from a sixty (60) month sentence
to give him credit for the time he has been incarcerated since his arrest on federal charges (July 21,
2005). Therefore, it is Mr. Campbell’s position that the period of time between July 21, 2005 and
October 30, 2006 should be subtracted from a sixty (60) month sentence to calculate the actual sentence
left to serve – forty-five (45) months.

                                                   3

to consider these factors, as they compose the “history and characteristics” of a particular defendant

and are necessary components to an individualized sentence. As explained more fully below, a

sentence of forty-five (45) months is therefore appropriate and adequate.

       Section 3553(a)(1) requires the Court to consider the history and characteristics of the

defendant. As noted in the PSR, Mr. Campbell had a very difficult childhood. His mother died in

a car accident when he was only two years old, and his father was incarcerated for most of his

childhood (¶ 58). As a result of effectively losing both his parents, Mr. Campbell went from home

to home as a child. He reports living with his maternal grandmother for about four years, his “step-

mother” for about two years, and his half-brother for about two years (¶ 59). Additionally, Mr.

Campbell spent time in various DSS placements (¶ 59). In or about 1990, Mr. Campbell ran away

from a DSS foster home where he was being physically abused; from 1990 until he was committed

to the custody of DYS at age 17, he lived with his father (¶ 60). Mr. Campbell served his first adult

sentence of incarceration at age 19, and has spent the majority of his adult years incarcerated (¶ 60).

       Mr. Campbell’s father passed away in 2001 (¶ 61). His younger brother, Andre, is detained

in state custody at the Cambridge Jail in Cambridge, Massachusetts (¶ 63). Mr. Campbell’s sister,

Andrea, is very supportive of Mr. Campbell, and has made it known that she will do whatever she

can to help her brother in the future. Despite his problems, Ms. Campbell describes her brother as

being a “good person” who is “loving” and “friendly.” (¶ 67).

       Given Mr. Campbell’s upbringing and home situation, it is not surprising that as a child he

was involved in counseling through the court system, his school, and DYS (¶ 73). Additionally, Mr.

Campbell began to consume alcohol and smoke marijuana at the age of fourteen (¶ 76). At the time




                                                  4
       Case 1:05-cr-10142-JLT          Document 35         Filed 10/26/2006       Page 5 of 7



of his arrest on the instant offense (March 19, 2005), Mr. Campbell was getting drunk four or five

times per week, and was smoking between eight and twelve marijuana cigarettes each week (¶ 76).

        The nature and circumstances of the offense also warrant a sentence of forty-five (45)

months. Mr. Campbell acknowledges that the offense for which he is about to be sentenced is

serious. Further, however, Mr. Campbell notes that while he is before this court to be sentenced in

this case only, the totality of his circumstances (his probation violation and his cases in Middlesex

Superior Court) mean that his crimes have and will be dealt with in the courts of the Commonwealth

as well as in this court.

        Section 3553(a)(2) requires the Court to consider the need for the sentence imposed to take

into consideration four (4) specific factors. These four (4) factors are as follows: (A) to reflect the

seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the

offense; (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) to protect the public from further

crimes of the defendant; and (D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational

training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner. As addressed

more fully below, a sentence of forty-five (45) months would adequately take these four factors into

consideration.

        Section 3553(a)(2)(A) requires the Court to impose a sentence that reflects the seriousness

of the offense, promotes respect for the law, and provides just punishment for the offense. It is Mr.

Campbell’s position that a sentence of forty-five (45) months does reflect the seriousness of the

offense and provides just punishment. This is particularly true given the fact that Mr. Campbell has

been sentenced to four (4) to six (6) years for his probation violation in state court, and still has




                                                  5
       Case 1:05-cr-10142-JLT           Document 35        Filed 10/26/2006        Page 6 of 7



outstanding cases in Middlesex Superior Court. Mr. Campbell faces a substantial amount of jail time

as a result of this collective situation.

        Section 3553(a)(2)(B) requires the Court to impose a sentence that affords adequate

deterrence to criminal conduct. A sentence of forty-five (45) months affords adequate deterrence

to criminal conduct for Mr. Campbell. This is particularly true given the fact that Mr. Campbell has

been sentenced to four (4) to six (6) years for his probation violation in state court, and still has

outstanding cases in Middlesex Superior Court. Mr. Campbell faces a substantial amount of jail time

as a result of this collective situation, and will be deterred from future criminal conduct.

        Section 3553(a)(2)(C) requires the Court to impose a sentence that protects the public from

further crimes of the defendant. As noted above, Mr. Campbell faces substantial jail time as a result

of this case and his state cases; as a result, he will have plenty of time to reflect on his actions and

plan for a productive future. Mr. Campbell is a young man who has had a very difficult life, but he

is committed to doing the right thing in the future and looks forward to beginning his adult life

outside the confines of the prison system after he has served his time on the current state and federal

cases. The concern that the public needs to be protected from potential further crimes of the

defendant is minimal in this situation.

        Finally, § 3553(a)(2)(D) requires the Court to impose a sentence that provides the defendant

with educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most

effective manner. A sentence of forty-five (45) months would be more than adequate for Mr.

Campbell to receive vocational training and substance abuse treatment.

         Given the facts stated above, as well as the presence of a mandatory post-incarceration term

of supervised release, defendant suggests that a sentence of forty-five (45) months is appropriate.
