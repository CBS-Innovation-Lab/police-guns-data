      ORDER ON DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION

      Defendant Sean Mulkern was charged by indictment on October 18, 2017 with

possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute in violation of 21

U.S.C.A. § 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B) (West 2021), possession of a firearm in furtherance of

a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. § 924(c)(1)(A)(i) (West 2021), and

as a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. 922(g)(1), 924(a), (e)

(West 2021) (ECF No. 1).      Mulkern sought to suppress all of the evidence and

statements obtained by the police as a result of a stop of his vehicle and search of his

person and vehicle, and all of the evidence obtained thereafter following the issuance

of a search warrant (ECF No. 31, 33). Following a hearing, Mulkern’s motion to

suppress was granted in part and denied in part (ECF No. 82).

      Mulkern conditionally pleaded guilty to the possession with intent to distribute

charge and the felon in possession charge on March 14, 2019, and he is awaiting

sentencing. He now brings the instant motion, urging this Court to reconsider its

previous ruling denying in part his motion to suppress (ECF No. 129). I held a
Case 2:17-cr-00147-JDL Document 146 Filed 04/05/21 Page 2 of 14         PageID #: 823




hearing on the motion on February 9, 2021. For the reasons that follow, I deny the

motion for reconsideration.

                                I. BACKGROUND

      A full recitation of the facts is available in my Order on Mulkern’s motion to

suppress (ECF No. 82). I summarize the key facts here.

A.    The Timberline Country Store Incident

       On May 24, 2017, two Buxton police officers—Officers Jessica Ramsay and

Warren Day—responded to a dispatch call regarding a reported incident involving

road rage and a threat with a gun at the Timberline Country Store in Buxton. The

911 dispatcher relayed a report that the driver of a white Corvette with red rims had

pulled a gun on a man at the store. The driver was described as a thin male wearing

a white shirt and baseball cap. The dispatcher also provided the Maine motor vehicle

registration number for the Corvette, which had left the scene. The dispatcher

advised, however, that the Maine registration number provided, “2512 VW,” was

assigned to a black Lexus, and not a white Corvette.

      While en route to the store, Officer Day spoke by phone to the individual who

made the 911 call, and was told that a man in a white Corvette had pulled out a gun

and threatened him with it.      At the store, Officer Ramsay viewed the store’s

surveillance video, which showed that following an initial verbal altercation with

three men, the white male driver of the white Corvette—which had red stripes

running the length of the vehicle and red rims—reached for an unidentifiable object

and held it at the center of his chest. The video showed that upon seeing this object,

the behavior of the three men became elevated and they started yelling and pointing.

                                          2
Case 2:17-cr-00147-JDL Document 146 Filed 04/05/21 Page 3 of 14         PageID #: 824




Due to the quality of the video, however, Officer Ramsay could not confirm that the

object was a gun. Officer Ramsay also spoke to a store employee who had witnessed

the incident. The employee described seeing a skinny man around fifty years of age

operating a white car with two red stripes get into an altercation with three men.

      After the investigation at the store, Office Ramsay issued a “be-on-the-lookout”

bulletin to the statewide police broadcast, which read:

      *** Caution Officer Safety ***
      On today[’]s date Buxton Police Department took a report of a male in a
      white Corvette with red rims [who] was in a[n] altercation at Timberline
      Country Store 222 Narragansett Trail. The operator[,] a male in his 40’s
      white shirt and ball cap, pulled out a hand gun and showed it to the
      victim. The vehicle was last seen headed toward Gorham. If located stop
      and identify the driver.
      Thank you for any assistance.

B.    The Traffic Stop, Search, and Arrest

      On May 25, 2017, at approximately 2:15 p.m., Sgt. Timothy Morrell of the

Westbrook Police Department, who had read the bulletin, spotted a white Corvette

with red rims in Westbrook. The Corvette matched the description from the Bulletin,

and it bore Maine registration 2513 VW. Sgt. Morrell ran a search of the Corvette’s

registration number in the Bureau of Motor Vehicles (“BMV”) database, which

identified Sean Mulkern as the registered owner. Sgt. Morrell observed that the

driver was a white man in his forties wearing a baseball cap. He then contacted the

Buxton Police Department and spoke with Chief Troy Cline, who confirmed that the

Corvette’s registration was one digit off from the registration number 2512 VW that

had been reported the previous day. This led Sgt. Morrell to believe that the Corvette

was the same vehicle identified in the bulletin.


                                          3
Case 2:17-cr-00147-JDL Document 146 Filed 04/05/21 Page 4 of 14          PageID #: 825




      Sgt. Morrell continued his surveillance of the Corvette, which was now parked

in the driveway of a residence, and he also ran a criminal background check on

Mulkern, which revealed that he was a convicted felon with a history of drug-related

charges.   After observing Mulkern standing outside the Corvette, Sgt. Morrell

positively identified Mulkern based on a photograph of Mulkern in the Bureau of

Motor Vehicles database.

      Sgt. Morrell was joined by two additional Westbrook police officers to assist

with surveillance. After observing Mulkern getting into the Corvette, beginning to

back out of the driveway, and then abruptly changing the direction of his car so as to

travel away from the police officers, Sgt. Morrell intuited that Mulkern had spotted

the police cruiser. At that point, Sgt. Morrell and another officer approached the

Corvette, ordered Mulkern out of the vehicle, and directed him to place his hands on

the rear of the car.

      In an ensuing pat down search, one of the officers felt an object which he

recognized to be a hypodermic needle in Mulkern’s jacket pocket. When the officer

asked if the object was a needle, Mulkern replied “no” and then reached for his pocket.

At that point, the officer placed Mulkern in handcuffs and removed the needle. In

response to further questions, Mulkern stated that the needle was not his and was

unused.

      The officer believed that the needle was drug-related contraband and

continued searching Mulkern. He felt a package of cigarettes in Mulkern’s jacket

pocket, which he removed. The package contained what appeared to be a crystal of

crack cocaine. Mulkern volunteered that “[t]his is mine . . . the needle isn’t.” The

                                           4
Case 2:17-cr-00147-JDL Document 146 Filed 04/05/21 Page 5 of 14           PageID #: 826




officer then asked Mulkern why he was fidgety, and Mulkern replied that he didn’t

want to get in trouble for a “little piece of crack.”

       The officer then conducted a search of the Corvette, and discovered several

baggies of what appeared to be crack cocaine and a large amount of cash. Mulkern

stated, unprompted, “[t]here you go, you got it right there,” or words to that effect.

An officer then read Mulkern Miranda warnings, and Mulkern was placed in a police

cruiser. A .9mm handgun was also ultimately found in the Corvette.

       During the course of the vehicle search, Officer Ramsay and Officer Day

arrived at the scene to interview Mulkern about the Timberline incident. Officer Day

also read Miranda warnings to Mulkern, who responded that he was not in Buxton

the prior day and was not going to answer any questions.

       Later that day, an agent of the Maine Drug Enforcement Agency obtained a

warrant to search a Winnebago registered to Mulkern. In the Winnebago, agents

found additional drugs, drug paraphernalia, and firearms. The warrant affidavit was

based in part on the evidence and statements obtained during Mulkern’s stop and

arrest on May 25, along with a proffer statement made by an informant eight days

earlier and a statement given by an occupant of the residence where Mulkern was

parked immediately prior to the stop and search.

C.     The Original Motion to Suppress and Order

       In his motion to suppress, Mulkern argued that (1) the traffic stop of his vehicle

was an unreasonable search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment, and all of the

evidence discovered during and as a result of the search must be suppressed; (2) even

if the traffic stop was lawful, the search of his person was not, and all of the evidence

                                             5
Case 2:17-cr-00147-JDL Document 146 Filed 04/05/21 Page 6 of 14          PageID #: 827




discovered during that search, as well as the evidence discovered pursuant to the

search warrant, must be suppressed; and (3) any statements he made after being

handcuffed and before he was read his Miranda rights must be suppressed because

he was in custody.

      I determined that the stop of Mulkern’s car and the searches that followed were

supported by probable cause to arrest Mulkern for the crime of having been a felon

in possession of a firearm during the Timberline incident on May 24, 2017. I noted

that the collective information available to the police gave them a reasonable basis to

believe that: (1) the operator of the Corvette was in possession of a firearm at the

Timberline on May 24, 2017, (2) Mulkern was that person who had been operating

the Corvette at the Timberline, and (3) Mulkern was a convicted felon. I further noted

that because there was probable cause to arrest Mulkern for being a felon in

possession of a firearm, the officers had sufficient cause to conduct searches of both

Mulkern’s person and his vehicle. I noted that there was no reason under the Fourth

Amendment to suppress Mulkern’s unsolicited statements made in reaction to those

searches, nor was there any reason to invalidate the warrant, which was based on

evidence obtained as a result of those searches. However, I did suppress all of

Mulkern’s non-spontaneous statements made in response to, or prompted by, the

questioning that took place after the crystal of cocaine was found on Mulkern’s body

and before he was read a Miranda warning, as I found that those statements were

obtained in violation of the Fifth Amendment.

      Mulkern now asks that I reconsider my order denying in part his motion to

suppress. He cites what he characterizes as newly discovered evidence in the form of

                                          6
Case 2:17-cr-00147-JDL Document 146 Filed 04/05/21 Page 7 of 14                       PageID #: 828




a portion of the dashcam video footage of the search of the Corvette—which was

included in the video evidence received and admitted during the suppression

hearing—showing one of the officers removing a license plate reading “6163 PV” from

the trunk area of the vehicle. He also submits several documents associated with his

registration of the Corvette at the Scarborough Branch of the BMV on May 24, 2017, 1

and two records of inquiries made by the Buxton Police Department. One of these

records shows a query by a Buxton Police dispatcher at 2:24 p.m. on May 25, 2017

regarding license plate number 2513 VW which indicates that it belongs to the white

1989 Corvette registered to Mulkern. The other shows a query by Officer Ramsay at

6:37 p.m. on May 25, 2017 regarding license plate number 2512 VW, which indicates

that it belongs to a black 2015 Lexus registered to another individual.                           The

Government does not object to the Court’s receipt and consideration of these

documents, and it has submitted a State of Maine Vehicle Registration document

showing that the 2513 VW license plate was registered to Mulkern as early as

February 24, 2017, as well as a document generated by the Buxton Police

Department’s Court Officer/Crime Analyst on the morning of the hearing which

indicates that the 2513 VW plate was run by Buxton Police on May 24, 2017 at 3:54

p.m.    Mulkern does not object to the Court’s receipt and consideration of the

Government’s additional exhibits.



 1 These include a bill of sale for the Corvette dated May 23, 2017; a receipt from the Scarborough
Branch of the BMV indicating that he paid an $8.00 transfer fee on May 24, 2017 at 4:45 p.m.; a vehicle
registration document for a white 1989 Corvette with the registration number 2513 VW titled “New-
Registration Transfer”; correspondence from the BMV dated April 30, 2020 regarding Mulkern’s
transactions on May 24, 2017; correspondence from the BMV dated July 17, 2020 regarding Mulkern’s
transactions on May 24, 2017; and a temporary insurance card dated May 24, 2017.

                               II. LEGAL STANDARD

      “[M]otions for reconsideration in criminal cases are not specifically authorized

either by statute or by rule.” United States v. Ortiz, 741 F.3d 288, 292 n.2 (1st Cir.

2014). However, the First Circuit has applied standards derived from the Federal

Rules of Civil Procedure in analyzing motions for reconsideration submitted in

criminal cases. See United States v. Allen, 573 F.3d 42, 53 (1st Cir. 2009) (considering

a motion for reconsideration of a motion to suppress); see also United States v. Peña-

Fernández, 394 F. Supp. 3d 205, 207 (D.P.R. 2019).

      “[M]otions for reconsideration are appropriate only in a limited number of

circumstances: if the moving party presents newly discovered evidence, if there has

been an intervening change in the law, or if the movant can demonstrate that the

original decision was based on a manifest error of law or was clearly unjust.” Allen,

573 F.3d at 53 (citing Marie v. Allied Home Mortg. Corp., 402 F.3d 1, 7 n.2 (1st Cir.

2005)). “A court will deny a motion for reconsideration based on the ‘new evidence’

exception if that evidence ‘in the exercise of due diligence[] could have been presented

earlier.’” Id. (quoting Emmanuel v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, Local Union No. 25, 426

F.3d 416, 422 (1st Cir. 2005)). Additionally, a showing that the original decision was

clearly unjust is “difficult to achieve” and “requires a definite and firm conviction that

a prior ruling on a material matter is unreasonable or obviously wrong.” Ellis v.

United States, 313 F.3d 636, 648 (1st Cir. 2002).

      “Motions for reconsideration are not to be used as ‘a vehicle for a party to undo

its own procedural failures [or] allow a party to advance arguments that could and

should have been presented to the district court prior to judgment.’” Allen, 573 F.3d

at 53 (alteration in original) (quoting Iverson v. City of Bos., 452 F.3d 94, 104 (1st Cir.

2006)).

                                   III. DISCUSSION

      I address Mulkern’s reconsideration motion by first deciding whether the

evidence submitted is newly discovered, and then considering whether the proffered

evidence leads to factual findings that are different than those set forth in my

December 7, 2018 Order on Mulkern’s Motion to Suppress and that would render that

decision clearly unjust.

A.    Newly Discovered Evidence

      The evidence that Mulkern proffers as “newly discovered” consists of dashcam

footage from the May 25, 2017 search of the Corvette, along with documents related

to Mulkern’s purchase of the Corvette on May 23, 2017 and his registration of the

Corvette on May 24, 2017, and records of two license plate inquiries made by the

Buxton Police Department.

      Mulkern contends that the portion of the dashcam footage beginning at minute

23:14 of the video, which depicts an officer removing a license plate reading “6163

PV” from the area behind the front passenger seat of the Corvette, was so difficult to

discover that “it was as if this evidence did not exist.” ECF No. 129 at 7. He notes

that “discovery of th[e] evidence was no easy task” as it required reviewing multiple

hours’ worth of video footage, and that the 6163 PV license plate was not mentioned

in any police reports or other discovery materials. Id. Accordingly, he contends that

this evidence is “newly discovered.” Id.



                                            9
Case 2:17-cr-00147-JDL Document 146 Filed 04/05/21 Page 10 of 14            PageID #: 831




      Mulkern acknowledges that the dashcam video was provided to him by the

Government and that the entire video was admitted as evidence at the hearing on

the motion to suppress. While the few seconds in the video that depict the officer

removing the 6163 PV license plate from the Corvette are no doubt fleeting, the

officer’s actions and the license plate itself are plainly visible. This portion of the

video falls squarely in the category of evidence that, “in the exercise of due diligence[]

could have been presented earlier.” Allen, 573 F.3d at 53. Indeed, the entire video

actually was presented earlier at the hearing on the motion to suppress, although

neither party focused their arguments on the few seconds now at issue. Regardless

of whether the portion of the video depicting the removal of the license plate is

characterized as evidence which was actually presented earlier or evidence which in

the exercise of due diligence could have been presented earlier, the evidence is not

newly discovered.

      The same conclusion applies to the various motor vehicle documents related to

Mulkern’s purchase and registration of the Corvette.           Mulkern notes that the

evidence relating to his registration of the Corvette was not within his “custody and

control” at the time he filed his motion to suppress, and that he had no need to obtain

these documents until he discovered the dashcam video showing the retrieval of the

6163 PV license plate. ECF No. 137 at 3. Again, however, Mulkern presents no

plausible reason why he could not have completed the investigative steps of watching

the dashcam video, discovering the allegedly important footage of the 6163 PV license

plate, and requesting the relevant documents from the BMV prior to the suppression

hearing. Mulkern does not allege any delay or reluctance on the part of the BMV to

                                           10
Case 2:17-cr-00147-JDL Document 146 Filed 04/05/21 Page 11 of 14        PageID #: 832




furnish the records, and he was clearly aware of their existence since it was his

actions that led to the creation of the documents. Again, this evidence could have

been obtained earlier, and therefore it is not newly discovered.

       As to the records of the two license plate inquiries made by the Buxton Police

Department—which Mulkern filed on the morning of the hearing on the motion for

reconsideration, separately from the motion itself—Mulkern has provided no

explanation as to where or how he obtained these documents. At the hearing on the

motion for reconsideration, the Government contended that these records were

available to Mulkern at the time of the suppression hearing, which Mulkern did not

dispute. Thus, this evidence is also not newly discovered.

B.     If Considered, the Evidence Does Not Affect the Court’s Factual
       Finding that Mulkern was the Operator of the White Corvette on May
       24, 2017, and Does Not Render the Order Denying the Motion to
       Suppress Clearly Unjust

     Mulkern argues that the newly proffered evidence supports his motion to

suppress in three ways: first, by establishing an alibi defense by showing that he was

at the BMV at the time of the Timberline incident, second, by showing that the 2513

VW license plate could not have been on the Corvette at the time of the incident at

the Timberline Country Store, and third, by showing that the police did not know

what license plate belonged to the Corvette involved in the Timberline incident on

May 24, 2017. According to Mulkern, these final two points indicate that the officers

lacked probable cause to arrest Mulkern at the time of the stop on May 25 for having

been a felon in possession of a firearm on May 24. Ultimately, Mulkern appears to




                                          11
Case 2:17-cr-00147-JDL Document 146 Filed 04/05/21 Page 12 of 14                       PageID #: 833




argue that his newly proffered evidence renders my December 7, 2018 Order on the

Motion to Suppress clearly unjust. His argument is unpersuasive.

       Mulkern correctly notes that the registration documents from the BMV

indicate that he registered the Corvette at the BMV’s Scarborough branch on May

24, 2017 at 4:45 p.m. The correspondence from the BMV further indicates that

Mulkern may have arrived at the BMV at 4:24 p.m. However, Mulkern’s contention

that this was “the very day and time he was allegedly seen driving a Corvette and

getting into an encounter in Buxton” is contrary to the evidence. ECF No. 129 at 6-

7.

       At the suppression hearing, Officer Ramsay testified that she was first alerted

to the incident at the Timberland Country Store at 3:58 p.m., and that the 911 call

initially came in at 3:52 p.m. 2 Citing MapQuest, the Government has posited that

the drive from the Timberline Country Store to the Scarborough Branch of the BMV

takes approximately nineteen minutes. Mulkern did not dispute this contention in

his reply or at the hearing. 3 While Mulkern argues that it is unlikely that the same

individual involved in the Timberline incident could have been at the BMV by 4:24

p.m., in reality more than thirty minutes passed between the 911 call and the time




 2 In its opposition, the Government notes that Officer Ramsay’s report indicates that she was notified

of the incident at 2:58 p.m. However, at the suppression hearing, Officer Ramsay testified that she
was actually notified at 3:58 p.m.

 3 Federal Rule of Evidence 201(a)(2) permits courts to take judicial notice of a fact that “can be

accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.”
See also Rindfleisch v. Gentiva Health Sys., Inc., 752 F. Supp. 2d 246, 259 n.13 (E.D.N.Y.
2010) (explaining that courts “commonly use internet mapping tools to take judicial notice of distance
and geography”).
                                                12
Case 2:17-cr-00147-JDL Document 146 Filed 04/05/21 Page 13 of 14        PageID #: 834




the BMV estimates that Mulkern arrived to register his vehicle—more than enough

time for Mulkern to drive from the Timberline Country Store to the BMV.

         Mulkern’s contention that the 2513 VW license plate could not have been on

the Corvette at the time of the Timberline incident is no more persuasive. Mulkern

argues in his motion for reconsideration that the documents from the BMV reveal

that he was not driving with the 2513 VW license plate on the Corvette on May 24,

2017. However, as the Government notes, the BMV documents indicate that Mulkern

simply transferred his license plate number at the BMV. In keeping with Maine law,

a person “who transfers the ownership or discontinues the use of a registered motor

vehicle” and who “applies for registration of another motor vehicle” may “use the

same number plates on payment of a transfer fee of $8.” 29-A M.R.S.A. § 502(1) (West

2021).

         Based on the $8.00 fee that Mulkern paid to the BMV and the fact that the

vehicle registration document is titled “New-Registration Transfer,” ECF No. 129-1

at 5, it appears highly likely that Mulkern possessed the 2513 VW license plate prior

to when he registered the Corvette on May 24, 2017. This fact is made even more

certain by the document submitted by the Government at ECF No. 132-1, which

establishes that Mulkern had been assigned the 2513 VW license plate prior to May

24, 2017. The fact that police officers discovered another license plate—6163 PV—in

the Corvette behind the front passenger seat as documented in the dashcam video

does not detract from this finding. In short, Mulkern offers no evidence to indicate

that the 2513 VW license plate was not on the Corvette at the time of the Timberline

incident.

                                         13
Case 2:17-cr-00147-JDL Document 146 Filed 04/05/21 Page 14 of 14        PageID #: 835




      Finally, Mulkern’s argument that the two license plate queries reveal that the

police did not know what license plate was on the Corvette involved in the Timberline

incident on May 24, 2017 is not consistent with the evidence presented at the

suppression hearing. The first query as to the Corvette on May 25, 2017 at 2:24 p.m.

is entirely consistent with the evidence that the Corvette had been spotted by Sgt.

Morrell roughly ten minutes earlier, and that Sgt. Morrell had contacted the Buxton

Police Department to confirm that the Corvette’s registration was one digit off from

the number that had been reported the prior day. The second query as to the 2512

VW plate which came roughly three hours after Mulkern’s arrest also does not

contradict the factual findings that I made in my December 7, 2018 Order. The police

may have looked up the 2512 VW plate for any number of reasons which are

consistent with my initial factual findings.

      Accordingly, the new evidence proffered by Mulkern, even if admitted, has no

effect on the findings of fact contained in my Order dated December 7, 2018, nor does

it change the outcome of the probable cause analysis. Accordingly, I conclude that

that decision was just and does not merit reconsideration.

                                 IV. CONCLUSION

      For the reasons stated above, Mulkern’s Motion for Reconsideration (ECF No.

129) is DENIED.

      SO ORDERED.
