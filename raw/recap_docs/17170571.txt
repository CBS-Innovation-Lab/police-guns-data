STATEMENT OF REASONS

VIl COURT DETERM|NATIONS OF RESTITUTION
A m Rcstitution Not Applicable.
B Total Amourit of Rcstitution:

C Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

l I:I For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under lti U S C § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number ot`
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under lS U S C § 3663A(c)(3)(A)

2 l:l For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 13 U S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount ofthe victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would bc outweighed by the burden on thc sentencing process under 18 U.S C. § 3663A(e){3)(13).
3 l:\ For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under iii U 5 C. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines restitution is not
ordered because the complication acid prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from thc fashioning ot`a restitution order outweigh

thc need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U S C. § 3663(a)(l)(|3)(ii).

4 |:l Rcstitulinn is not ordered for other rcasoiis. (Explain.)
