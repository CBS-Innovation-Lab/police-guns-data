                        UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                             DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

                  v.                          Criminal Nos. 10-cr-110, 111-01-JD

Jeffrey Merrill



                                            ORDER


       The assented to motion to reschedule jury trial (document no. 22 in 10-cr-110-01-JD,

document no. 20 in 10-cr-111-01-JD) filed by defendant Merrill is granted, however the continuance

is limited to 45 days in the interest of justice so that an evaluation can be completed. Trial is

continued to the two-week period beginning June 21, 2011, 9:30 AM.

       Defendant shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights within 10 days. The court finds that the

ends of justice served by granting a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv), for the reasons set forth in the motion.

       SO ORDERED.


                                                      /s/ Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr.
