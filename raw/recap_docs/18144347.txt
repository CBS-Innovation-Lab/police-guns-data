                  ORDER DISMISSING MOTION FOR LEAVE
      On June 21, 2016, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit granted Mark

McCurdy’s application seeking leave to file a second or successive 28 U.S.C. § 2255

motion on the ground that Mr. McCurdy had made a prima facie showing that his

challenge, pursuant to Johnson v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015), to his armed-

career-criminal designation legitimately relies upon a “new rule of constitutional law,

made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was

previously unavailable.” J. at 1 (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2255(h)(2)) (ECF No. 376) (J.).

On June 27, 2016, Mr. McCurdy filed a motion to vacate his sentence, Mot. Under 28

U.S.C. § 2255 to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sent. by a Person in Fed. Custody (ECF

No. 380), and on June 27, 2016, the Magistrate Judge appointed David R. Beneman,

the Federal Defender for the District of Maine, to represent Mr. McCurdy in his §

2255 motion. Order Appointing Counsel (ECF No. 382). On the same day, the

Magistrate Judge also ordered the Government to answer Mr. McCurdy’s motion.

Order to Ans. (ECF No. 383).

      On June 27, 2016, in addition to filing his motion to vacate, Mr. McCurdy filed

with this Court a motion for leave in order to avoid missing the June 26, 2016 filing

deadline. Mot. for Leave at 1-2 (ECF No. 381). Mr. McCurdy dated the motion for

leave on June 20, 2016. Id. at 2. In the motion, Mr. McCurdy states that he is filing

the motion for leave to file a § 2255 motion, and he asks the Court to “hold the same

in abeyance pending authorization by the First Circuit Court of Appeals for

permission to file the instant §2255 motion.” Id. at 1. From this statement and from

the date of the motion for leave, the Court concludes that Mr. McCurdy had not yet

received the First Circuit’s June 21, 2016 judgment, authorizing the filing of the

second or successive § 2255 motion, when he mailed his motion for leave. J. at 1 (“The

motion shall be deemed filed in the district court on November 25, 2015”).

      Because Mr. McCurdy’s June 27, 2016 motion for leave requests from this

Court the same relief that has already been granted by the Court of Appeals for the

First Circuit, the Court DISMISSES as moot without prejudice Mark McCurdy’s

Motion for Leave (ECF No. 381).

      SO ORDERED.
