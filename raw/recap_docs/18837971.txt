                            RE: RULE 11 PROCEEDINGS (PLEA OF GUILTY)
11
12   I.         Procedural Background
13              On September 24, 2012, a grand jury returned an indictment against Oscar Calvino-Ramos,
14   (hereinafter referred to as “defendant”). (Docket No.14.) The defendant has agreed to plead guilty to
15   count one of the indictment. Count one charges that from on or about September 10, 2012, in the
16   District of Puerto Rico, and within the jurisdiction of this court, Oscar Calvino-Ramos, having been
17   convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, did knowingly possess
18   in and affecting interstate commerce, a firearm and ammunition, to wit, a Glock pistol, Model 22, .40
19   caliber, serial number DEV682US, loaded with fifteen (15) rounds of .40 caliber ammunition, said
20   firearm having been shipped and transported in interstate commerce, all in violation of Title 18, United
21   States Code, Section 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2).
22   II.        Consent to Proceed Before a Magistrate Judge
23              On April 22, 2013, while assisted by counsel the defendant, by consent, appeared before the
24   undersigned in order to change his previous not guilty plea to a plea of guilty as to count one of the
25   indictment. In open court the defendant was questioned as to the purpose of the hearing being held and
26   was advised of: (a) the nature and purpose of the hearing; (b) the fact that all inquiries were to be
27   conducted under oath and that it was expected that his answers would be truthful; (c) the potential
28   consequences of lying under oath (such as a perjury charge); and (d) his right to have the change of plea

 2   proceedings presided by a district judge instead of a magistrate judge. The defendant was also
 3   explained the differences between the appointment and functions of the two. The defendant consented
 4   to proceed before the undersigned magistrate judge.
 5   III.     Proceedings Under Rule 11, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure
 6            A.      Rule 11(c)(1) Requirements
 7                    Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure governs the acceptance of
              guilty pleas to federal criminal violations. Pursuant to Rule 11, in order for a plea of
 8            guilty to constitute a valid waiver of the defendant’s right to trial, guilty pleas must be
              knowing and voluntary: “Rule 11 was intended to ensure that a defendant who pleads
 9            guilty does so with an ‘understanding of the nature of the charge and consequences of
              his plea.’” United States v. Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting
10            McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 467 (1969)). [There are three core concerns
              in these proceedings]: 1) absence of coercion; 2) understanding of the charges; and 3)
11            knowledge of the consequences of the guilty plea. United States v. Cotal-Crespo, 47
              F.3d at 4 (citing United States v. Allard, 926 F.2d 1237, 1244-45 (1st Cir. 1991)).

     United States v. Hernández-Wilson, 186 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1999).
13
              B. Admonishment of Constitutional Rights
14
              To assure defendant’s understanding and awareness of his rights, defendant was advised of his
15
     right:
16
              1.   To remain silent at trial and be presumed innocent, since it is the government who has the
17
     burden of proving his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
18
              2.   To testify or not to testify at trial, and that no adverse inference could be made in relation
19
     to his decision not to testify.
20
              3.   To a speedy trial before a district judge and a jury, at which he would be entitled to see and
21
     cross examine the government witnesses, present evidence on his behalf, and challenge the
22
     government’s evidence.
23
              4.   To have a unanimous verdict rendered by a jury of twelve persons which would have to be
24
     convinced of defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt by means of admissible evidence.
25
              5.   To use the subpoena power of the court to compel the attendance of witnesses.

 2           Upon listening to the defendant’s responses, observing his demeanor and his speaking with his

 3 attorney, that to the best of counsel’s belief defendant had fully understood his rights, it is determined
 4 that defendant is aware of his constitutional rights.
 5           C. Consequences of Pleading Guilty

 6           Upon advising defendant of his constitutional rights, he was further advised of the consequences

 7 of pleading guilty. Specifically, defendant was advised that by pleading guilty and upon having his
 8 guilty plea accepted by the court, he will be giving up the above rights and will be convicted solely on
 9 his statement that he is guilty.
10           Furthermore, the defendant was admonished of the fact that by pleading guilty he would not be

11 allowed later on to withdraw his plea because he eventually might disagree with the sentence imposed,
12 and that if he violates the conditions of supervised release, that privilege could be revoked and he could
13 be required to serve an additional term of imprisonment. He was also explained that parole has been
14 abolished.
15           In response to further questioning, defendant was explained and he understood that if convicted

16 on count one he will face the following penalties: a term of imprisonment of not more than ten (10)
17 years, a fine not to exceed $250,000.00, and a term of supervised release of not more than three (3) years.
18           The defendant was also explained what the supervised release term means. Defendant was also

19 made aware that the court must impose a mandatory penalty assessment of one hundred dollars ($100)
20 per offense pursuant Title 18, United States Code, Section 3013(a).
21           The defendant was advised that the ultimate sentence was a matter solely for the court to decide

22 in its discretion and that, even if the maximum imprisonment term and fine were to be imposed upon
23 him, he later could not withdraw his guilty plea for that reason alone. The defendant understood this.

 2              D. Plea Agreement1

 3              The parties have entered into a written plea agreement that, upon being signed by the

 4 government, defense attorney and defendant, was filed and made part of the record. Defendant was
 5 clearly warned and recognized having understood that:
 6              1.   The plea agreement is not binding upon the sentencing court.

 7              2.   The plea agreement is an agreement between the defendant, defense counsel and the attorney

 8 for the government which is presented as a recommendation to the court in regards to the applicable
 9 sentencing adjustments and guidelines, which are advisory.
10              3.   The agreement provides a sentencing recommendation and/or anticipated sentencing

11 guideline computation, that can be either accepted or rejected by the sentencing court.
12              4.   In spite of the plea agreement and any sentencing recommendation contained therein, the

13 sentencing court retains full discretion to reject such plea agreement and impose any sentence up to the
14 maximum possible penalty prescribed by statute.
15              Defendant acknowledged having understood these explanations and all the terms and conditions

16 of the plea agreement.
17              E. Government's Evidence (Basis in Fact)

18              The government presented a proffer of its evidence consistent with the version of facts of the plea

19 agreement with which the defendant concurred. Accordingly, it is determined that there is a basis in fact
20 and evidence to establish all the elements of the offense charged.
21              F. Voluntariness

22              The defendant accepted that no threats had been made to induce him to plead guilty and that he

23 did not feel pressured to plead guilty.

 2           G. Waiver of Appeal

 3           The defendant was explained, and he understood, that if the court accepts the plea agreement and

 4 sentences him according to its terms and conditions, he will be surrendering his right to appeal the
 5 sentence and judgment in this case.
 6   IV.     Conclusion

 7           The defendant, by consent, has appeared before me pursuant to Rule 11, Federal Rules of

 8 Criminal Procedure, has entered a plea of guilty as to count one of the indictment. After cautioning and
 9 examining the defendant under oath and in open court, concerning each of the subject matters mentioned
10 in Rule 11, as described in the preceding sections, I find that defendant Oscar Calvino-Ramos is
11 competent to enter this guilty plea, is aware of the nature of the offense charged and the maximum
12 statutory penalties that the same carries, understands that the charge is supported by the government’s
13 evidence, has admitted to every element of the offense charged, and has done so in an intelligent and
14 voluntary manner with full knowledge of the consequences of his guilty plea. Therefore, I recommend
15 that the court accept the guilty plea of the defendant and that the defendant be adjudged guilty as to count
16 one of the indictment.
17           Any objections to this report and recommendation must be specific and must be filed with the

18 Clerk of Court within fourteen (14) days of its receipt. Failure to timely file specific objections to the
19 report and recommendation is a waiver of the right to review by the district court. United States v.
                                 st
20 Valencia-Copete, 792 F.2d 4 (1 Cir. 1986).
21           SO RECOMMENDED.
