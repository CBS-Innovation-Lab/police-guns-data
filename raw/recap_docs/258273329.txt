Hennessy, U.S.M.J.

         In compliance with the Due Process Protections Act, the Court issues the following Order.

Consistent with Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and its progeny:

         The United States is ordered to disclose all exculpatory information, in a timely manner,

to the defendants. This information includes, but is not limited to, evidence that is material and is

favorable to any of the defendants. Specific categories of exculpatory evidence that must be

provided to the defendants are set out in Local Rule 116.2. The failure to discharge this obligation

may result in consequences, including the reversal of any conviction, exclusion of evidence,

adverse jury instructions, dismissal of charges, contempt proceedings, and/or sanctions by the

Court.

So Ordered.
