                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE




United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 07-cr-54-PB

Walter Nichols


                                  O R D E R


     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

June 5, 2007 trial in the above case, citing the need for

additional time to complete discovery and engage in plea

negotiations or prepare a defense.          The government does not

object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reasons and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from June 5, 2007 to September 5, 2007.               In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
