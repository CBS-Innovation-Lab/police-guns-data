                          UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                       FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE

United States of America

        v.                                         Case No. 10-cr-19-PB

Luis Rios


                                     O R D E R

        The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

trial scheduled for July 7, 2010 for a period of two weeks,

citing the need for additional time to finalize a plea agreement.

The government does not object to a continuance of the trial

date.

        Accordingly, for the above reasons, the court will continue

the trial from July 7, 2010 to July 19, 2010.               In agreeing to

continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ยง

3161(h)(7)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the ends of

justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the best

interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.

        No further continuances.

        SO ORDERED.
