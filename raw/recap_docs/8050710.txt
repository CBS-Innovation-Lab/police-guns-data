                    UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                  FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND


UNITED STATES OF AMERICA              :
                                      :
            v.                        :       CR 06-145-01 ML
                                      :
HOMMY ACEVEDO                         :


                      REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION

David L. Martin, United States Magistrate Judge

     This matter has been referred to me pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
§ 636(b)(1)(B) and 18 U.S.C. § 3401(i) for proposed findings of
fact concerning whether Defendant Hommy Acevedo (“Defendant”) is
in violation of the conditions of his probation and, if so, for a
recommended disposition.       In compliance with that directive and
in accordance with 18 U.S.C. § 3565(a) and Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.1,
hearings were conducted on November 8, 2007, April 4, May 2, and
August 5, 2008.    At the hearings on November 8, 2007, and April
4, 2008, Defendant, both personally and through counsel, waived a
violation hearing and admitted that he had violated the terms and
conditions of his probation as specified in petitions filed by
the United States Probation Department.          Based on Defendant’s
admission, I find that Defendant has violated probation and
recommend that Defendant be sentenced to three months
imprisonment to be followed by two years of supervised release.
                              Facts and Travel
     On April 13, 2007, Defendant appeared before Chief United
States District Judge Mary M. Lisi after pleading guilty to three
counts of knowingly and intentionally making false statements on
a firearms application in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(a)(6).
See Judgment of 4/13/07 (Document (“Doc.”) #8) at 1.            Judge Lisi
     Case 1:06-cr-00145-ML-DLM    Document 18   Filed 08/12/2008   Page 2 of 13


imposed a sentence of three years probation1 with the first six
months on home confinement with electronic monitoring.                See id.
at 2-3.     As special conditions of release, Defendant was ordered
to participate in mental health and substance abuse treatment
programs and submit to random drug testing.             See id. at 3.      A
$300.00 special assessment was also imposed and was paid in full
on April 18, 2007.       See id. at 4-5; see also Probation Violation
Report dated October 22, 2007 (the “First Violation Report”), at
1.     Defendant’s sentence was below the Sentencing Guidelines
range of 10 to 16 months.
        On October 24, 2007, Senior U.S. Probation Officer Brian
Pletcher (“U.S.P.O. Pletcher”) filed a Petition for Summons for
Offender Under Supervision (the “Petition”), alleging that
Defendant unlawfully used marijuana on May 8, May 21, June 25,
July 11, August 3, and October 10, 2007.            See Petition at 1-2.
In response to the Petition, Judge Lisi ordered the issuance of a
summons, see id. at 2, and on November 8, 2007, Defendant
appeared on the summons before this Magistrate Judge.                At that
time he was informed of the grounds for the alleged violation.
After being so advised, Defendant waived a violation hearing and,
both personally and through counsel, admitted to the violations
stated in the Petition.          This admission satisfied the Court that
there was an adequate basis for finding that Defendant had
violated the conditions of probation.           The Government recommended
that the hearing be continued for ninety days to permit Defendant
to participate in substance abuse and mental health treatment.
The Court accepted this recommendation and advised Defendant that
he was being given a chance to demonstrate that he could refrain
from using marijuana and all controlled substances.                Defendant
was cautioned that if he failed to do so he could be required to



        1
       Defendant’s term of probation is scheduled to terminate on
April 12, 2010. See Probation Violation Report dated October 22, 2007
(the “First Violation Report”) at 1.

appear before the Court sooner than ninety days and that such a
development would adversely affect the recommendation which would
be made regarding disposition of the violation to which he had
admitted.
     On February 1, 2008, U.S.P.O. Pletcher submitted a report to
the Court advising that Defendant had encountered numerous
setbacks (loss of employment, separation from his girlfriend,
etc.) and requested that the hearing be continued for an
additional sixty days.        The Court granted this request, and the
matter was re-scheduled to April 4, 2008.
     On March 28, 2008, U.S.P.O. Pletcher filed an Amended
Petition for Summons for Offender Under Supervision (“Amended
Petition”), adding to the original Petition the allegation that
Defendant had failed to participate in mental health as well as
substance abuse treatment programs as instructed.             See Amended
Petition at 1-2.    Judge Lisi ordered the issuance of a summons in
response to the Amended Petition, see id. at 2, and on April 4,
2008, Defendant appeared on the summons before this Magistrate
Judge.   At that hearing Defendant was informed of the grounds for
the alleged new violation.        He waived a violation hearing and
admitted to the additional grounds for violation.
     The Court then received sentencing recommendations from both
the Government and the defense.           The Government recommended that
Defendant be sentenced to a term of three months imprisonment
followed by two years probation.          Defense counsel argued for
release, citing among other reasons that Defendant was steadily
employed as a dishwasher at a Providence restaurant.              The Court
continued the matter until May 2, 2008, and directed that
Defendant provide U.S.P.O. Pletcher with his earning statements
to verify his employment.        In releasing Defendant, the Court
indicated that it was attaching significant weight to the
representation that Defendant was gainfully employed.
     At the hearing on May 2, 2008, the Court stated that it had


                                      3
     Case 1:06-cr-00145-ML-DLM    Document 18   Filed 08/12/2008   Page 4 of 13


received a report from U.S.P.O. Pletcher that was generally
favorable as it indicated that Defendant was employed.                While the
Court noted that Defendant had missed a treatment appointment,
U.S.P.O. Pletcher advised that he had recently arranged for
Defendant to receive mental health treatment in Pawtucket and
that this would be more convenient for Defendant.              The Court
informed Defendant that it would continue the matter to August 5,
2008, to allow a further opportunity for him to demonstrate that
he could comply with the terms of probation, maintain employment,
and keep his treatment appointments.            The Court indicated that if
Defendant satisfied these requirements, it would recommend that
he be continued on probation and that he not be imprisoned for
the violations to which he had admitted.
        On August 5, 2008, Defendant appeared for the hearing.
U.S.P.O. Pletcher reported that Defendant had tested positive for
controlled substances on four occasions since he was before the
Court on May 2, 2008.        The Government again recommended that he
be sentenced to 90 days imprisonment for the violations to which
he had admitted.       Defense counsel urged that Defendant be
continued on probation.          The Court advised Defendant that it
would recommend to Chief Judge Lisi that he be imprisoned for
three months for the violations.            As Defendant continued to be
employed, the Court allowed him to remain at liberty until Judge
Lisi determines whether to accept this recommendation.
                                 The Violations
I.     The First Violation (Admitted November 8, 2007)
        The First Violation Report alleges that Defendant has
violated the following condition of probation in the manner
indicated below:
Standard Condition: Defendant shall refrain from any unlawful use
of a controlled substance.
        On May 8, May 21, June 25, July 11, August 3, and October
10, 2007, Defendant unlawfully used marijuana as evidenced by his


                                        4
  Case 1:06-cr-00145-ML-DLM    Document 18    Filed 08/12/2008   Page 5 of 13


own admissions and positive urinalysis test results for THC, an
indication of marijuana use.       Chief Judge Lisi was notified on
August 29, 2007, of the first five positive drug tests and also
of the Probation Department’s August 28, 2007, compliance review
meeting with Defendant in which he was notified that further drug
use may result in revocation proceedings.
      Defendant submitted specimens for drug testing on the
indicated dates, and the test results were positive for THC, an
indication of marijuana use.       On each occasion, Defendant was
candid about his drug use and related that it was due to family
and financial stresses.       As of October 22, 2007, Defendant was
participating in mental health and medication monitoring sessions
at Fellowship Health Resources and substance abuse treatment at
the Adcare Outpatient Facility.          His counselors reported that he
was attending sessions faithfully and that he was prescribed
Adderal for Adult Attention Deficit Disorder and Lexapro for
depression.   In addition to THC, the specimen submitted on
October 10, 2007, also tested positive for amphetamines.
However, the testing laboratory was consulted, and the laboratory
personnel reported that Adderal will produce a positive result
for amphetamines.
II.   The Second Violation (Admitted April 4, 2008)
      The Probation Violation Report dated March 28, 2008 (the
“Second Violation Report”), states that Defendant has violated
the following condition of probation in the manner indicated
below:
Special Condition: Defendant shall participate in and
satisfactorily complete a program of substance abuse treatment,
to include periodic testing.
      Defendant failed to participate in substance abuse treatment
as evidenced by verbal and written reports from Adcare Hospital
of Worcester on the indicated dates: 11/7/07-no show (showed for
drug tests on 11/14/07, 11/21/07, and 11/28/07); 12/12/07-


                                     5
  Case 1:06-cr-00145-ML-DLM   Document 18   Filed 08/12/2008   Page 6 of 13


cancelled, illness; 12/19/07-cancelled; 12/26/07-cancelled, work
(showed for drug test on 12/5/07); 1/4/08-no show; 1/23/08-showed
45 minutes late, was not seen (showed for drug tests on 1/16/08
and 1/23/08); 2/20/08-cancelled.
     As noted above, the Probation Office was notified by
Defendant’s clinician at Adcare Hospital of Worcester that
Defendant either cancelled or failed to report for substance
abuse treatment sessions.      It was noted that Defendant would
frequently show up just to provide a drug screen, but too late
for his session.
Special condition: Defendant shall participate in and
satisfactorily complete a program of mental health treatment as
approved by the U.S. Probation Office.
     On the dates indicated, Defendant failed to participate in a
mental health treatment program as evidenced by verbal and
written reports from Fellowship Health Resources: 11/21/07-
cancelled four hours prior due to family issues; 11/28/07-no
show; 12/12/07-cancelled; 12/27/07-no show; 1/2/08-no show;
1/9/08-cancelled; 1/16/08-cancelled; 2/13/08-cancelled; 2/14/08-
no show; 2/20/08-cancelled; 3/12/08-cancelled; 3/20/08-no show.
In addition, on March 24, 2008, Defendant was discharged from
mental health treatment for failing to comply with treatment.
     As stated above, on the indicated dates, the Probation
Office was notified by Defendant’s clinician at Fellowship Health
Resources that Defendant cancelled or failed to report for
scheduled treatment sessions.      The clinician also noted that he
frequently changed his schedule to accommodate Defendant’s
employment.   However, the sessions were repeatedly cancelled.
Due to Defendant’s failure to comply with treatment appointments,
he was discharged on March 24, 2008.
                                   Law
Statutory Provisions
     According to § 3565(a)(1) and (2) of Title 18 of the United


                                    6
  Case 1:06-cr-00145-ML-DLM   Document 18    Filed 08/12/2008   Page 7 of 13


States Code (“U.S.C.”), if a defendant violates a condition of
probation at any time prior to the expiration or termination of
the term of probation, the Court may, after a hearing pursuant to
Fed. R. Crim. P. Rule 32.1, and after considering the factors set
forth in § 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable,
continue probation, with or without extending the term or
modifying or enlarging the conditions, or revoke the sentence of
probation and resentence the defendant under subchapter A.              The
Court may sentence a defendant up to the statutory maximum for
the original offense.     However, the Court must consider the
policy statements detailed in Chapter 7 of the sentencing
guidelines.   In this case, the statutory maximum term of
imprisonment for the original offense is ten years.             The maximum
authorized term of probation that could have been imposed for the
original offense is five years.         Since only three years of the
five year maximum probation term was already imposed, probation
can be extended for an additional two years.
     Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3565(b)(4), if a defendant, as part
of drug testing, tests positive for illegal controlled substances
more than three times over the course of one year, the court
shall revoke the sentence of probation and resentence the
defendant under subchapter A to a sentence that includes a term
of imprisonment.    Section 3563(e) provides that the Court shall
consider whether the availability of appropriate substance abuse
treatment programs, or an individual’s current or past
participation in such programs, warrants an exception in
accordance with United States Sentencing Commission guidelines
from the rule of § 3565(b) when considering any action against a
defendant who fails a drug test.
Sentencing Guidelines
     Section 7B1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines
(“U.S.S.G.”) provides for three grades of violations.
Section 7B1.1(a) of the U.S.S.G. states that a Grade A violation


                                    7
  Case 1:06-cr-00145-ML-DLM   Document 18   Filed 08/12/2008   Page 8 of 13


consists of (A) conduct which is punishable by a term of
imprisonment exceeding one year that (i) is a crime of violence,
(ii) is a controlled substance offense, or (iii) involves
possession of a firearm or destructive device; or (B) any other
offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding twenty
years.   Conduct consisting of any other offense punishable by a
term of imprisonment exceeding one year constitutes a Grade B
violation.   Conduct constituting an offense punishable by a term
of imprisonment of one year or less, or violation of any other
condition of supervision, is classified as a Grade C violation.
In this case, Defendant has committed Grade C violations.
     Pursuant to Section 7B1.3(a)(2) of the U.S.S.G., upon a
finding of a Grade C violation, the Court may revoke, extend, or
modify probation.    Here, Defendant has committed a Grade C
violation.   Therefore, the Court may revoke, extend, or modify
the conditions of probation.
     Section 7B1.3(b) provides that in the case of a revocation
of probation, the applicable range of imprisonment is that set
forth in §7B1.4 (Term of Imprisonment).
     If the Court finds that Defendant has committed a Grade B or
C violation, §7B1.3(c)(1) states that where the minimum term of
imprisonment determined under §7B1.4 is at least one month but
not more than six months, the minimum term may be satisfied by
(A) a sentence of imprisonment; or (B) a sentence of imprisonment
that includes a term of supervised release with a condition that
substitutes community confinement or home detention according to
the schedule in §5C1.1(e) for any portion of the minimum term.
If the Court finds that Defendant has committed a Grade B or C
violation, §7B1.3(c)(2) states that where the minimum term of
imprisonment determined under §7B1.4 is more than six months but
not more than ten months, the minimum term may be satisfied by
(A) a sentence of imprisonment; or (B) a sentence of imprisonment
that includes a term of supervised release with a condition that
substitutes community confinement or home detention according to

                                    8
  Case 1:06-cr-00145-ML-DLM   Document 18   Filed 08/12/2008   Page 9 of 13


the schedule in §5C1.1(e), provided that at least one-half of the
minimum term is satisfied by imprisonment.        The first provision,
which allows for alternatives for any portion of the minimum
term, applies to this matter.
     According to Section 7B1.3(d), any restitution, fine,
community confinement, home detention, or intermittent
confinement previously imposed in connection with the sentence
for which revocation is ordered that remains unpaid or unserved
at the time of revocation shall be ordered to be paid or served
in addition to the sanction determined under §7B1.4.           In this
case, there are no outstanding financial obligations.
Additionally, Defendant completed his home confinement term on
October 12, 2007.
     Section 7B1.3(e) of the U.S.S.G. states that when the Court
revokes probation and imposes a term of imprisonment, it shall
increase the term of imprisonment determined above by the amount
of time in official detention that will be credited toward
service of the term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. § 3585(b),
other than time in official detention resulting from the federal
probation violation warrant or proceeding.
     Section 7B1.3(g)(1) of the U.S.S.G. provides that where
probation is revoked and a term of imprisonment is imposed, the
provisions of §§5D1.1 - 1.3 shall apply to the imposition of a
term of supervised release.      Section 5D1.1(a) states that if a
sentence of imprisonment of more than one year is imposed, the
Court shall order a term of supervised release to follow
imprisonment.   Subsection (b) provides that the Court may order a
term of supervised release in any other case.         Section 5D1.2
states that if a term of supervised release is imposed, the
length shall be between three and five years for a defendant
convicted of a class A or B felony; between two and three years
for a defendant convicted of a class C or D felony; or one year
for a defendant convicted of a class E felony or class A
misdemeanor.    In this case, Defendant was convicted of a Class C

                                    9
 Case 1:06-cr-00145-ML-DLM    Document 18    Filed 08/12/2008   Page 10 of 13


felony.    Therefore the maximum statutory term of supervised
release that may be imposed to follow imprisonment is three
years.    Thus, if a term of supervised release is to be imposed,
the guideline term shall be between two and three years.
     Pursuant to Section 7B1.4(a) of the U.S.S.G., the criminal
history category is the category applicable at the time the
defendant originally was sentenced to a term of supervision.               In
this instance, Defendant had a criminal history category of I at
the time of sentencing.      The Revocation Table contained in
Section 7B1.4(a) of the U.S.S.G. provides that for a Grade C
violation with a criminal history category of I an imprisonment
range of three to nine months is warranted.2
     Section 7B1.5(a) of the U.S.S.G. states that, upon
revocation of probation, no credit shall be given (toward any
term of imprisonment ordered) for any portion of the term of
probation served prior to revocation.
                                Discussion
Government’s Recommendation
     At the hearings on April 4 and August 5, 2008, the
Government recommended that Defendant be sentenced to three
months imprisonment to be followed by a term of supervised
release for two years.       In making this recommendation, Assistant
U.S. Attorney Peter Neronha observed that Defendant had
effectively sentenced himself by his repeated failures to refrain
from using controlled substances.        In the Government’s view,
Defendant’s conduct indicated that he did not take the conditions
of probation seriously.      On the issue of whether Defendant should
be detained pending Judge Lisi’s consideration of this Magistrate
Judge’s Report and Recommendation regarding the violations, the

     2
        The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has held that
Chapter 7 policy statements (including §7B1.4) are advisory rather
than mandatory. See United States v. Ramirez-Rivera, 241 F.3d 37, 40
(1st Cir. 2001); United States v. O’Neil, 11 F.3d 292, 302 n.11 (1st
Cir. 1993).

                                    10
 Case 1:06-cr-00145-ML-DLM   Document 18   Filed 08/12/2008   Page 11 of 13


Government left this to the Court’s discretion.
Defense’s Recommendation
     Defense counsel Kevin Fitzgerald argued that Defendant
should be continued on probation.       Mr. Fitzgerald noted that
Defendant was employed, that he had an apartment, and that he had
acquired a vehicle.    If he is incarcerated, he will lose all of
these things.    Mr. Fitzgerald observed that Defendant was not
charged with new criminal conduct, but was before the Court for
failing to comply with conditions related to substance abuse
treatment and mental health treatment.       Those conditions, Mr.
Fitzgerald contended, were put in place to assist Defendant.3
Mr. Fitzgerald referred to the instances where Defendant had
tested positive for controlled substances as “stumbles” and
suggested that the Court should not ignore the test results which
were negative.    He concluded by stating that Defendant would
receive no substance abuse or mental health treatment in the
course of the three month prison sentence recommended by the
Government and that nothing positive would come from
incarcerating Defendant.
Defendant’s Statement.
     Defendant stated that he was embarrassed to be before the
Court.   He explained that there had been a “few things going in
[his] life ...,” and that he had “fallen off the horse a few
times,” apparently referring to his positive urine tests.            He
indicated that on the occasions when he canceled or failed to
keep treatment appointments it was due to work or child care
conflicts.   Defendant stated that he had recently received a
promotion at work with a pay raise and that he was now in charge
of the dish room at the restaurant where he was employed and also
of a cleaning crew.    In response to the Court’s inquiry as to how


     3
       The presumed implication of this remark appears to have been
that a violation of these conditions should not be used to send
Defendant to prison.

                                   11
 Case 1:06-cr-00145-ML-DLM    Document 18   Filed 08/12/2008     Page 12 of 13


many hours he worked per week, Defendant responded that a month
ago it had dropped to as low as fifteen or sixteen hours per
week, but now he was guaranteed to have at least forty hours per
week.
Court’s Recommendation
     As the Court told Defendant at the hearing, his file is one
of the thickest violation files which this Magistrate Judge has
seen.   The Court has repeatedly continued this matter to allow
Defendant to demonstrate that he can comply with the conditions
of probation, especially those which prohibit the use of
controlled substances.       Instead of demonstrating compliance,
Defendant’s problems with controlled substances have continued.
This Magistrate Judge concludes that he has no choice but to
adopt the recommendation of the Government.         Defendant’s repeated
use of controlled substances cannot be tolerated.              While the fact
that Defendant will lose his employment is regrettable, this
Magistrate Judge repeatedly warned Defendant over the last
several court appearances that he needed to comply with the
conditions of probation in order for the Court to recommend that
he be continued on probation.       The warnings appear to have had
little effect.   If other defendants perceive that conditions of
probation or supervised release can be repeatedly violated,
despite warnings from the Court, compliance by these defendants
with their conditions of probation or supervised release is
likely to decline.    Accordingly, this Magistrate Judge recommends
that Defendant be sentenced to three months imprisonment to be
followed by two years of supervised release.
     With regard to the condition that Defendant participate in
mental health treatment, his mental health counselor has reported
to the Probation Department that Defendant continues to associate
with persons who use marijuana and other controlled substances
and that he is unwilling to end these relationships.              The
Probation Department questions whether continuing to expend


                                    12
 Case 1:06-cr-00145-ML-DLM   Document 18     Filed 08/12/2008   Page 13 of 13


financial resources to provide Defendant with mental health
treatment is warranted.      The Court agrees that if Defendant is
unwilling to follow the suggestions provided by his mental health
counselor, it makes little sense to continue to spend scarce
dollars to provide such treatment.         Accordingly, for that reason,
I recommend that mental health treatment no longer be provided
and that Defendant’s participation in such treatment not be
included as a condition of supervised release.
                               Conclusion
     After considering the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. §
3553(a) and for the reasons expressed above, I recommend that
Defendant be sentenced to three months imprisonment to be
followed by a period of supervised release for two years.              I
further recommend that Defendant not be required to participate
in mental health treatment as a special condition of supervised
release as he is unwilling to follow treatment recommendations.
     Any objection to this Report and Recommendation must be
specific and must be filed with the Clerk of Court within ten
(10) days of its receipt.      See Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b); DRI LR Cv
72(d).   Failure to file specific objections in a timely manner
constitutes waiver of the right to review by the district court
and of the right to appeal the district court’s decision.              See
United States v. Valencia-Copete, 792 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1986);
Park Motor Mart, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 616 F.2d 603, 605 (1st
Cir. 1980).
