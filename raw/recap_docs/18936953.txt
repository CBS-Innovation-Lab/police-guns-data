                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 10-cr-11-PB

Leo Ellis


                                  O R D E R

     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

trial scheduled for April 6, 2010, citing the need for additional

time to complete discovery and to complete the Therapeutic

Community Program in which he is currently enrolled prior to

trial.    The government does not object to a continuance of the

trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reasons and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from April 6, 2010 to July 7, 2010.             In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(7)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
