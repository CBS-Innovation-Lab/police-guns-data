      RESPECTFULLY PRESENTING PETITION FOR ACTION OF COURT FOR

CAUSE AS FOLLOWS:

      1.    VIOLATION OF SPECIAL CONDITION -               “THE DEFENDANT SHALL

PARTICIPATE IN A DRUG TREATMENT PROGRAM (IN-PATIENT OR OUT-PATIENT)

AND SUBMIT TO RANDOM URINALYSIS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DRUG

AFTERCARE PROGRAM POLICY OF THE U.S. PROBATION OFFICE APPROVED BY

THIS COURT. THE DEFENDANT IS REQUIRED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF

SERVICES RENDERED (CO-PAYMENT) BASED ON THE ABILITY TO PAY OR

AVAILABILITY OF THIRD PARTY PAYMENTS, AS APPROVED BY THE COURT. ”

      2.      VIOLATION OF SPECIAL CONDITION -              “ THE DEFENDANT SHALL

SUBMIT TO A PSYCHIATRIC AND/OR PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION, AND, IF

NEEDED, PARTICIPATE IN A MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT PROGRAM ARRANGED

AND APPROVED BY THE PROBATION OFFICER UNTIL DISCHARGED BY

AUTHORIZED PROGRAM PERSONNEL WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE PROBATION

OFFICER.”

      On September 12, 2007, offender was referred to an ambulatory drug treatment

program wherein on September 20 and October 3, 2007, respectively, a drug and mental

health assessment were performed. As such, he was immediately referred to Phase II of

said treatments, however, as of the submission of this motion, he has only attended three

individual and group counseling sessions. In spite of having referred offender to drug and

mental health treatments, he has shown no interest in receiving ambulatory treatment.

When confronting offender with his non-compliance, he would state that he was not in need

of said treatments nor does he believe in same.

       2.    VIOLATION OF STANDARD CONDITION 2: “THE DEFENDANT SHALL

REPORT TO THE PROBATION OFFICER AS DIRECTED; AND SHALL SUBMIT A

TRUTHFUL AND COMPLETE WRITTEN REPORT WITHIN FIVE (5)DAYS OF EACH

MONTH.”

       On October 4, November 26, and 29, 2007 and January 8, 2008, messages were

left with offender’s grandmother, instructing Mr. Villegas-Russo to report the following day

for a surprise urine sample and he failed to do so. On November 7, 2007, a message was

left for offender with his boss and a co-worker to report the following day for a urine sample

and he also failed to report as instructed. Additionally, offender had an office appointment

scheduled for April 8, 2008 and he failed to comply with same. On April 12, 2008, this officer

visited offender in Corozal, Puerto Rico, however, he was not home. His grandmother

informed that he was spending the weekend with friends at the Inter-College Games in

Ponce. A message was left for him to report to the office the following Monday, April 14,

2008, for a surprise urine sample and office visit, however, he never showed up nor did he

contact his U.S. Probation Officer. On April 17, 2008, another message was left for offender

with his grandmother to report the following day for a urine sample and office visit and again

offender failed to report as requested. Mr. Villegas-Russo has also failed to provide the

addresses where he stays when he is not at his recorded residence. Additionally, offender

has not submitted his Monthly Supervision Reports since March 2008.

       WHEREFORE, I declare under penalty of perjury, that the above mentioned in true

and correct. In view that the offender violated his conditions of release, we respectfully

request , that the Court issue a an arrest warrant so that he may appear before this

Honorable Court to show cause why his supervised release term should not be revoked.

Thereupon, he to be dealt with pursuant to law.
