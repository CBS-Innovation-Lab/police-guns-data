MICHAEL ST. PIERRE                   )


                      ORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS

      Michael St. Pierre raises in his motion to dismiss the same issues the Court

previously rejected. United States v. Zetterman, No. 09-54-B-W, 2010 U.S. Dist.

LEXIS 25288 (D. Me. Mar. 17, 2010); United States v. Rehlander, 685 F. Supp. 2d

159 (D. Me. 2010); United States v. Murphy, 681 F. Supp. 2d 95 (D. Me. 2010);

United States v. Small, No. CR-09-184-B-W, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13698 (D. Me.

Feb. 16, 2010). These issues are now before the Court of Appeals for the First

Circuit in the Rehlander and Small cases and the appellate court’s resolution of

these appeals may affect the merits of Mr. St. Pierre’s motion. However, until the

First Circuit alters its ruling in United States v. Chamberlain, 159 F.3d 656 (1st

Cir. 1998), this Court, as an inferior court, is obligated to apply its holding.

Accordingly, for the reasons the Court described in its prior opinions, the Court

DENIES Michael St. Pierre’s Motion to Dismiss the Indictment (Docket # 14).

      SO ORDERED.


                               /s/ John A. Woodcock, Jr.
