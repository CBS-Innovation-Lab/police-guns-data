                         ORDER ON DEFENDANT’S MOTIONS IN LIMINE


          Before the Court are the following motions in limine filed by Defendant Brian Bilodeau:

 (1) Motion in Limine to Prohibit Government from Presenting Evidence of Uncharged Firearms

 (ECF No. 1188), (2) Motion in Limine to Prohibit the Government from Presenting Evidence of

 the Seizure of Certain Automobiles (ECF No. 1189), and (3) Second Motion for Bill of Particulars

 (ECF No. 1190). To aid the parties in preparing for trial, the Court provides the following pretrial

 rulings.



 I.           Motion in Limine to Prohibit Government from Presenting Evidence of

              Uncharged Firearms (ECF No. 1188)

          This Motion is GRANTED. Via this Motion, Defendant asks the Court to exclude evidence

 related to three uncharged firearms under Federal Rules of Evidence 402 and 403. 1 Defendant has

 been charged in Count Four of the Second Superseding Indictment with possession of a firearm in


 1
  The firearms at issue were all seized from Bilodeau’s home on February 27, 2018 and include (1) a Kimber 45 caliber
 pistol (located in a case in the master bedroom), (2) a Mossberg .22 caliber rifle (located in a spare bedroom closet),
 and (3) a Walther PK380 pistol (located in inside a gun safe that was in a safe room in the basement). Response (ECF
 No. 1201), PageID # 4567.
Case 2:18-cr-00063-GZS Document 1226 Filed 10/04/22 Page 2 of 4                      PageID #: 5015




 furtherance of a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A). (Sec. Sup. Indict.

 (ECF No. 1164), PageID # 4463.) The firearm at issue in Count Four is a Beretta, model BU9

 Nano, 9 mm pistol, which the Government represents was located “on the nightstand” in

 Bilodeau’s master bedroom “with a loaded magazine and one round loaded in the chamber.”

 (Response (ECF No. 1201), PageID # 4567.) Given this charge, Defendant reasonably asserts that

 evidence of the other uncharged firearms is likely to confuse the jury and unfairly prejudice him.

 The Government maintains that evidence that Defendant possessed the uncharged firearms is

 relevant because the firearms were located “in the same place where he received, counted, and

 stored large quantities of illegal drugs and drug proceeds.” (Id., PageID # 4569.) Notably, this

 location was also Bilodeau’s home.

        On balance, the Court finds the probative value of the uncharged firearms to be low and,

 thus, the Court agrees with Defendant that these firearms should be excluded from the

 Government’s case-in-chief under Federal Rule of Evidence 403. However, the Court notes that

 the Government may seek reconsideration of this ruling based on the evidence presented at trial.



 II.        Motion in Limine to Prohibit the Government from Presenting Evidence of the

            Seizure of Certain Automobiles (ECF No. 1189)

        This Motion is GRANTED. Via this Motion, Defendant asks the Court to exclude evidence

 related to two vehicles seized from Defendant, “a blue 2016 Lamborghini Hurcan and a black 2014

 Nissan GT-R,” under Federal Rules of Evidence 402 and 403. (Mot. (ECF No. 1189), PageID #

 3532-33.) As the Government notes in its Response, these vehicles were seized through an already

 completed administrative process. (Response (ECF No. 1202), PageID # 4573 n.1.) Thus, the

 Government indicates that it will not offer any evidence of the actual seizure of the vehicles. (Id.)




                                                  2
Case 2:18-cr-00063-GZS Document 1226 Filed 10/04/22 Page 3 of 4                      PageID #: 5016




 However, the Government proffers that the vehicles are relevant “evidence of the accumulation of

 wealth,” which the Government seeks to tie to the charged criminal activity. (Id., PageID # 4574.)

 The Government also proffers that it will establish that “Defendant drove the Lamborghini during

 the course of the conspiracy” and thereby “corroborate identification.” (Id.)

        Based on the Government’s proffer, evidence of these two vehicles, as well as the other

 “high-value vehicle” mentioned in the Government’s Response (id.), is subject to exclusion under

 Federal Rule of Evidence 403. At this stage, the probative value of Defendant’s possession of

 high-value vehicles is substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice and confusion of the issues.

 The Court is particularly concerned about ensuring that the trial not be sidetracked and delayed by

 excessive evidence and argument regarding how Bilodeau financed the purchase of each high-

 value vehicle. (See, e.g., Reply (ECF No. 1205), PageID # 4587.)

        As a result, the Government is instructed that it shall not mention Defendant’s ownership

 or possession of any high-value vehicles in its opening statement. Prior to seeking to introduce

 any evidence related to Defendant’s purchase or use of high-value vehicles, the Government shall

 alert the Court outside the presence of the jury so that the Court can resolve any objections.



 III.       Second Motion for Bill of Particulars (ECF No. 1190)

        This Motion is DENIED. This Court earlier denied Bilodeau’s request for a bill of

 particulars. (See 12/20/2019 Order on Defendants’ Mots. Re: Bill of Particulars (ECF No. 677).)

 However, the Government has more recently obtained a Second Superseding Indictment and

 Defendant’s current request for a bill of particulars centers on alteration of the Count One

 conspiracy charge to include only one named co-conspirator. In response to Defendant’s argument

 that the conspiracy charged in Count One of the Second Superseding Indictment failed to




                                                  3

 sufficiently identify known co-conspirators, the Government has clarified that the conspiracy

 involves “the same conspirators charged in Count One of the Superseding Indictment (ECF No.

 82).” (Response (ECF No. 1200), PageID # 4564.) With this clarification, the Court is satisfied

 that Defendant has sufficient information to prepare for trial and avoid any unfair surprise.



        All of these pretrial rulings are made WITHOUT PREJUDICE to counsel renewing their

 objections or seeking further opportunities to proffer outside the presence of the jury.



        SO ORDERED.
