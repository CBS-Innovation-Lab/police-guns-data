                           SENTENCING MEMORANDUM

       Defendant Eduardo Rodriguez submits this sentencing memorandum to assist the

court in determining the appropriate sentence. For the reasons set forth in detail below,

the court should sentence Mr. Rodriguez to a total term of incarceration of 48 months.

That sentence is “sufficient, but not greater than necessary” to comply with the purposes

set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2). It is a sentence that reflects the seriousness of the

offenses of conviction, promotes respect for the law, provides just punishment, affords

adequate deterrence and protects the public from further criminal conduct by Mr.

Rodriguez. A longer term of incarceration would be greater than necessary to accomplish

those goals.

                                         Argument

       I.      The Court Is Required To Impose A Sentence Sufficient But Not
               Greater Than Necessary To Comply With the Purposes Set Forth in
               18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)

       After Booker, a sentencing court must impose a sentence minimally “sufficient,

but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in” 18 U.S.C.

§ 3553(a)(2). 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). See also United States v. Foreman, 436 F.3d 638,

643-44 & n.1 (6th Cir. 2006) (“a district court's mandate is to impose “a sentence

sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes” of section
  Case 1:04-cr-10374-DPW           Document 41         Filed 01/22/2007       Page 2 of 6



3553(a)(2)”); United States v. Cawthorn, 419 F.3d 793, 802 (8th Cir. 2005) (“district

court’s duty” is that it “shall impose a sentence sufficient but not greater than

necessary”). The court is required to consider the following sentencing factors:

               (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and
               characteristics of the defendant;

               (2) the need for the sentence imposed--

                       (A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for
                       the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;

                       (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;

                       (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and

                       (D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational
                       training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most
                       effective manner;

               (3) the kinds of sentences available;

               (4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established for--

                       (A) the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable
                       category of defendant as set forth in the [United States Sentencing
                       G]uidelines--

                       …

               (5) any pertinent policy statement--

                       (A) issued by the Sentencing Commission …

               (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants
               with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct; and

               (7) the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.

18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).

       A 48-month sentence would be consonant with all of the sentencing factors set

forth in § 3553 and would recognize that Mr. Rodriguez is a flesh and blood individual

who stands before the court at a particular point in his unique life. Even when the

Sentencing Guidelines were mandatory, the First Circuit Court of Appeals emphatically

emphasized that this should be the goal of a sentencing judge:

               [T]he guidelines provide uniformity, predictability, and a
               degree of detachment lacking in our earlier system. This
               too must be remembered, however. It has been uniform
               and constant in the federal judicial tradition for the
               sentencing judge to consider every convicted person as an
               individual and every case as a unique study in the human
               failings that sometimes mitigate, sometimes magnify, the
               crime and punishment to ensue.

United States v. Olbres, 99 F.3d 28, 36-37 (1st Cir. 1996) (citation omitted).

               A. A 48-Month Sentence Is Appropriate Given the History and
                  Characteristics Of the Defendant

       At one point during the presentence interview, Mr. Rodriguez paused and

remarked the he had spent a large portion of his adult life in jail. “Isn’t that sad,” he

remarked. It was apparent from Mr. Rodriguez’ manner that this was the first time he

had reflected on the consequences of the choices he has made about how to live his life.

He has come to realize, for the first time in his life, that he has the power and the ability

to make better decisions and avoid the consequences of drug addiction and crime.

       No doubt Mr. Rodriguez has made poor choices. He reluctantly left rural Puerto

Rico with his family at age 13 and was thrown into the completely unfamiliar rough and

tumble streets of Newark New Jersey. Mr. Rodriguez quickly became the target of

violent bullies. He reasoned, poorly, that the only way to get respect was to be like the

bullies. See PSR at ¶ 58. His criminal behavior continued and escalated as he got older.

       There can also be no doubt that Mr. Rodriguez has paid dearly for his criminal

conduct in New Jersey. His first adult case, at age 19, resulted in a conviction for


                                              3
 Case 1:04-cr-10374-DPW            Document 41        Filed 01/22/2007       Page 4 of 6



receiving stolen property and a relatively heavy three-year committed sentence. His

second adult case, also at age 19, resulted in a seven year committed sentence for

aggravated assault and possession of a weapon. Although those two sentences ran

concurrently, they are relatively heavy sentences for a 19 year-old first and second time

offender.

       Mr. Rodriguez also received a relatively heavy three-year total sentence for a

Massachusetts adult conviction, possession with intent to distribute cocaine and

distribution in a school zone. In the experience of undersigned counsel, many defendants

who agree to plead guilty, as Mr. Rodriguez did, escape enhanced punishment for school

zone violations and those counts often are dismissed. Not in Mr. Rodriguez’ case.

        Many defendants stand before this court at sentencing and proclaim that they

have seen the errors of their ways and are ready to turn their lives around. The court

should have confidence that Mr. Rodriguez means it when he says it, and not just because

of his epiphany during the presentence interview. The idea of many more years in prison

was so intolerable to Mr. Rodriguez that he made preparations to take his own life in the

event this court were to impose a fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence. See PSR at

¶ 69. The lengths to which Mr. Rodriguez was willing to go to avoid a lengthy sentence

strongly suggest that he will be motivated to make the right decisions and stay out of

situations that could return him to jail once he finishes serving whatever sentence this

court will impose.

       Mr. Rodriguez has every reason to turn his life around. He recently got married

to a woman with whom he has had an off and on relationship over the past ten years. She

has a stable life, working in the computer field and residing in Stoughton, where Mr.

Rodriguez will reside upon his release. He will be able to avoid returning to Brockton

and exposing himself to the temptations of drugs and crime that were his life there.

                   B. A 48-Month Sentence is Sufficient But Not Greater Than
                      Necessary To Comply With The Sentencing Factors Set Forth In
                      18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)

           A 48-month sentence is sufficient to promote respect for the law, to provide just

punishment for the offense and to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct. See 18

U.S.C. § 3553 (a)(2)(A) and (B). It is also more than sufficient to specifically deter Mr.

Rodriguez from committing another crime.

           Mr. Rodriguez exhibits several characteristics that the Sentencing Commission

has identified as indicators of reduced rates of recidivism. He is relatively old (35) and

he is married with children. Two recent studies conducted by the Sentencing

Commission, entitled Measuring Recidivism: The Criminal History Computation of the

Federal Sentencing Guidelines (hereinafter “Release 1”),

http://www.ussc.gov/publicat/Recidivism_General.pdf; and A Comparison of the Federal

Sentencing Guidelines Criminal History Category and the U.S. Parole Commission

Salient Factor Score (hereinafter “Release 2”), http://www.ussc.gov/publicat/

RecidivismSalientFactorCom.pdf, include the following findings:


      •    Age: “Recidivism rates decline relatively consistently as age increases,” from
           35.5% under age 21, to 9.5% over age 50.1 Under the Parole Commission’s
           Salient Factor Score (SFS), which is a better predictor of recidivism than Criminal
           History Category, the older the defendant is and the fewer the number of prior
           commitments, the less likelihood of recidivism. Age is a powerful component of
           recidivism prediction, which the Guidelines do not take into account.2

      •    Family: Recidivism rates are associated with marital status (never married,
           divorced, married).3

                                          Conclusion

           For all of the foregoing reasons, the court should impose a sentence of 48 months.

That sentence is sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to satisfy the statutory

sentencing factors.
