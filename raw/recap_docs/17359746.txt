             ORDER ON MOTION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE
                         28 U.S.C. § 2255 MOTION

         Kevin Murphy has filed a motion with this court requesting that the court grant

  him an extension of one year for the filing of a 28 U.S.C. § 2255 motion challenging his

  April 13, 2009, criminal judgment. Murphy does not specify the length of the extension

  he wants apropos the running of his limitation year. He does catalog a host of difficulties

  he is having as a consequence of his confinement which apparently interfere with his

  ability to prepare a 28 U.S.C. § 2255 motion. It appears that Murphy did not pursue a

  direct appeal of his sentence. See, e.g. Kapral v. United States, 166 F.3d 565, 577 (3d

  Cir. 1999) ("If a defendant does not pursue a timely direct appeal to the court of appeals,

  his or her conviction and sentence become final, and the statute of limitation begins to

  run, on the date on which the time for filing such an appeal expired."). It further appears

  that he has some months remaining in his year. This court cannot grant Murphy the

  relief he seeks from the congressional mandated one-year limitation period. See

            It seems that Murphy is now attempting to have some of his prior convictions overturned with the
  hopes of lowering his criminal history category. However, efforts such as this do not statutorily toll the 28
  U.S.C. § 2255(f)(1) limitation period and do not provide a basis for this Court to grant him an extension of
  that statutory period. This does not mean that should Murphy successfully vacate a predicate conviction
  after his year has run that he would be barred from attempting to convince the court that he can bring his
  claims under § 2255(f)(4). See Johnson v. United States, 544 U.S. 295 (2005). Of course, § 2255(f)(4)
  applies to first-time 28 U.S.C. § 2255 motions.
