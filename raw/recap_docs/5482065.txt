                     MOTION TO APPOINT COUNSEL AND
                    TO CONTINUE SENTENCING HEARING

     Defendant, Michael Fowler, respectfully moves that this

Court appoint the Federal Defender Office through undersigned as

counsel to represent him in all further proceedings in connection

with this case.    If the Court is inclined to appoint counsel,

defendant further moves that the Court continue the sentencing

hearing, presently scheduled for August 20, 2007, to November 8,

2007 or as soon thereafter as is convenient to the Court.              As

support of this motion, defendant states the following:

     1.   Fowler has proceeded pro se in this matter since the
          inception of this case, as well as in a companion
          matter of United States v. Michael Fowler, Criminal No.
          05-10145-NG before Judge Gertner.

     2.   Fowler, in his pro     se capacity, negotiated a plea
          agreement with the     government and pled guilty on May
          17, 2006. Shortly      thereafter, the Probation Department
          interviewed Fowler     and prepared a draft Presentence
          Report.

     3.   Fowler, in his pro se capacity, has since struggled to
          compose objections to the Presentence Report. The
          Court has granted a number of continuances for him to
          do so; the most recent grant was on July 10, 2007. In
          granting Fowler’s request for a further continuance at
          that hearing, the Court set a deadline of August 3,
          2007 for the submission of his objections.
    Case 1:04-cr-10308-JLT   Document 66   Filed 08/17/2007   Page 2 of 3



     4.   On August 3, 2007, the Probation Department advised
          undersigned counsel that it had not yet received
          Fowler’s objections.

     5.   On August 6, 2007, undersigned counsel met with Fowler
          at MCI Walpole, where he is currently being detained,
          to discuss the status of Fowler’s pro se objections.
          At that meeting, Fowler informed undersigned counsel
          that he wished to revoke his previous request to
          proceed pro se and to have undersigned counsel
          represent him for all further proceedings, including
          the filing of objections, a sentencing memorandum (if
          necessary), and oral advocacy at the sentencing
          hearing.1

     6.   Undersigned counsel informed Fowler that two major
          consequences would flow from his decision to request
          appointed counsel: (1) he would thereafter be precluded
          from filing any further motions, memoranda or other
          filing with the Court on his own, and (2) undersigned
          counsel would request a continuance of the sentencing
          hearing to accommodate undersigned counsel’s looming
          trial schedule in other matters. Fowler understood and
          agreed to these consequences.

     7.   Undersigned counsel will require a brief continuance of
          the sentencing hearing to review the discovery and plea
          agreement in this matter so that he can submit
          appropriate objections to the Presentence Report.
          Counsel will not be able to review these items until he
          completes trial in United States v. Gregory P. Simone,
          Criminal No. 06-10192, a three-week trial which is to
          begin on September 9, 2007.

     8.   The government assents to this Motion, but will be on
          paternity leave and thus unavailable (in light of
          undersigned counsel’s schedule) until mid-October.




     1
      Fowler indicated that he had also mailed a motion to
undersigned counsel requesting appointment of counsel;
undersigned counsel has not yet received Fowler’s written motion
but is satisfied, based on the August 6, 2007 meeting and
Fowler’s inability to litigate the sentencing portion of his
case, that Fowler is certain of his decision to request
appointment of counsel.

     Wherefore, defendant requests that the Court appoint the

Federal Defender Office and the undersigned to represent

defendant for further proceedings in this case, and that the

Court continue the sentencing hearing and associated deadlines

until November 8, 2007.
