              ORDER AFFIRMING RECOMMENDED DECISION
                     OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE


      On July 25, 2016, the United States Magistrate Judge filed with the court,
with copies to the parties, his Recommended Decision on 28 U.S.C. ยง 2255
Motion. The time within which to file objections expired on August 11, 2016,
and no objection has been filed. The Magistrate Judge notified the parties that
failure to object would waive their right to de novo review and appeal.
      It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the Magistrate
Judge is hereby ADOPTED. The Court shall transfer the pending section 2255
motion to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1631
and First Circuit Rule 22.1(e).
      I DENY a certificate of appealability pursuant to Rule 11 of the Rules
Governing Section 2255 Cases because there is no substantial showing of the
denial of a constitutional right within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. ยง 2253(c)(2).
      SO ORDERED.

      DATED THIS 15TH   DAY OF    AUGUST, 2016
