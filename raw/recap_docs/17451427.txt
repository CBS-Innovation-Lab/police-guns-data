SARIS, D.J.

        In accordance with the Memorandum and Order issued this date

granting defendant Michael Alan Crooker’s (“Crooker”) motions for

a certificate of innocence and a certificate of requisite facts

pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1495 and 2513(b), this Court hereby

CERTIFIES the following:


(1)    Crooker was convicted of Transportation of a Firearm in
       Interstate Commerce by a Convicted Felon in violation of 18
       U.S.C. §§ 921 and 922(c) in United States v. Crooker, CR 04-
       30034-PBS (formerly MAP);

(2)    Crooker’s conviction was reversed by the United States Court
       of Appeals for the First Circuit on the ground that he is
       not guilty of the offense of which he was convicted in
       connection with United States v. Crooker, CR 04-30034-PBS
       (formerly MAP), as appears from the record of the court
       setting aside or reversing such conviction. See United
       States v. Crooker, 608 F.3d 94 (1st Cir. 2010)(reversing
       conviction and remanding for entry of Judgment of Acquittal

       qualify as a “firearm” within the meaning of the statutory
       definition of 18 U.S.C. §§ 921(a)(3)© and 924); Mandate
       (Docket No. 263); and Judgment of Acquittal (Docket No.
       264). See also 28 U.S.C. § 2513(a)(1).

by a Convicted Felon pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 921 and 922©
in United States v. Crooker, CR 04-30034-PBS (formerly MAP)
constituted no offense against the United States, or any
State, Territory or the District of Columbia, and Crooker
did not by his misconduct or neglect cause or bring about
his own prosecution. See 28 U.S.C. § 2513(a)(2).
