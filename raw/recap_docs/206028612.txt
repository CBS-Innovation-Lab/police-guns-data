            ORDER DISMISSING DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR EARLY
                 TERMINATION OF SUPERVISED RELEASE

       On June 24, 2013, the Court sentenced Dawlin Cabrera to 120 months of

 incarceration, five years of supervised release, and a $100.00 special assessment for

 his part in a drug-trafficking conspiracy distributing large volumes of crack cocaine

 in Maine. J. (ECF No. 496). On March 31, 2015, the Court granted Mr. Cabrera’s

 motion to reduce his term of incarceration from 120 months to 97 months, based on

 the retroactive application of changes in statutory and guideline law.         Order

 Regarding Mot. for Sentence Reduction Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) (ECF No.

 855). On March 22, 2019, Mr. Cabrera completed his term of incarceration. See

 https://www.bop.gov/inmateloc/ (BOP Register No. 66317-054) (last visited July 12,

 2022). Under the terms of the criminal judgment, Mr. Cabrera is not scheduled to be

 terminated from supervised release until March 21, 2024.

       On June 6, 2022, Mr. Cabrera filed a motion for early termination of supervised

 release. Mot. to Reduce Supervised Release Term Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(1)

 (ECF No. 1095) (Def.’s Mot.). In his motion, Mr. Cabrera stresses that his “risk of
Case 1:11-cr-00205-JAW Document 1097 Filed 07/12/22 Page 2 of 3          PageID #: 5499




 rearrest is much lower than average.” Id. at 9. Mr. Cabrera also writes that he poses

 “no risk to the community of future criminal re-offense” and he notes that he has

 “served over one year of supervised release and committed no new crimes.” Id. at 18.

       In its objection to Mr. Cabrera’s motion, the Government notes that on July 22,

 2020, while on supervised release, Mr. Cabrera was arrested in New Jersey and failed

 to report this arrest to his Probation Officer. Gov’t’s Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. for Early

 Termination of his Supervised Release at 1 (ECF No. 1096). On March 25, 2021, a

 grand jury in Bergen County, New Jersey indicted Mr. Cabrera, charging him with

 possession of controlled substances with the intent to distribute, possession of

 cocaine, and money laundering. Id. at 1-2.

       The Government attached a copy of the New Jersey indictment to its

 opposition. The March 25, 2021, indictment contains four counts: (1) Count One

 alleges that on July 22, 2020, Mr. Cabrera possessed buprenorphine with the intent

 to distribute it, (2) Count Two alleges that on July 22, 2022, he possessed

 buprenorphine, (3) Count Three alleges that on July 22, 2020, he possessed

 $204,184.00 in United States currency derived from criminal activity, and (4) Count

 Four alleges that on July 22, 2020, he possessed cocaine. Id., Attach. 1, The State of

 New Jersey v. Dawlin S. Cabrera, Indictment at 1-3.

       In view of these new charges, the Court DISMISSES without prejudice Dawlin

 Cabrera’s motion for early termination of supervised release. The Court does so first

 because even though these charges are still pending in the state of New Jersey, the

 Court deems it prudent to wait until these charges are resolved before reaching the



                                           2

 merits of Mr. Cabrera’s motion. Second, the Court notes that the Government alleges

 that Mr. Cabrera did not inform his Probation Officer of his New Jersey arrest. If

 true, this would be a violation of Standard Condition 11 of the terms of his supervised

 release. J. at 3 (“[T]he defendant shall notify the probation officer within seventy-

 two hours of being arrested or questioned by a law enforcement officer”). Third, even

 though Mr. Cabrera had been indicted in New Jersey as of the date of his motion for

 early termination, Mr. Cabrera’s nineteen-page motion makes no mention

 whatsoever of these criminal charges and instead insists that his “full compliance

 with all conditions of supervised release” and law abiding “conduct warrants early

 termination in this case.” Def.’s Mot. at 18-19. Based on the information before the

 Court, the Court concludes that Mr. Cabrera’s motion amounts to misleading the

 Court by omission.

       The Court therefore DISMISSES without prejudice Dawlin Cabrera’s Motion

 to Reduce Supervised Release Term Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(1) (ECF No.

 1095). If Mr. Cabrera is not convicted of any of the New Jersey charges and wishes

 to explain his apparent violation of the terms of his supervised release and his

 significant factual omissions, he is free to refile his request for early termination as

 he deems appropriate.

       SO ORDERED.
