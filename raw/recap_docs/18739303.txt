the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. §
3161 (h) (8) (B) (iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would unreasonably deny the

defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective preparation taking into account the

exercise of due diligence under the circumstancesl
