                                   ORDER

     Re: Document No. 91, MOTION for Rule 52 - Findings and
Conclusions re: Endorsed Order denying [85] Motion to Correct Illegal
Sentence

     Ruling: Granted. The motion, in reality, seeks to challenge
defendant's sentence, and is properly considered as a petition
seeking relief under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. Section 2255. As
such, it is a second or successive petition which the United States
Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has not authorized this court
to consider; and, on its face it is untimely as it is filed well beyond
one year after defendant's conviction became final, and well beyond
one year after the date on which the facts supporting the claim
asserted could have been discovered through the exercise of due
diligence (in this case, defendant seems to assert that his state
sentence was corrected in 2006, and that fact seems to form the basis
for his current claim for federal relief); and, the federal sentence
is to be served in part concurrently and in part consecutively to
the state sentence, however corrected. That the state reduced its
sentence is not a fact that would likely result in a reduction of
the federal sentence even if the issue were subject to
reconsideration pursuant to defendant's current motion.          See 28
U.S.C. Sections 2255(f) and 2244.
