                  ORDER AFFIRMING THE
       RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE

        The United States Magistrate Judge filed with the Court on February

  16, 2017 his Recommended Decision (ECF No. 34). The Petitioner filed his

  objections to the Recommended Decision on March 2, 2017 (ECF No. 36) and

  the Respondent filed its response to those objections on March 16, 2017 (ECF

  No. 38).      I have reviewed and considered the Magistrate Judge’s

  Recommended Decision, together with the entire record; I have made a de

  novo determination of all matters adjudicated by the Magistrate Judge’s

  Recommended Decision; and I concur with the recommendations of the

  United States Magistrate Judge for the reasons set forth in his

  Recommended Decision, and determine that no further proceeding is

  necessary.

        1. It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the
           Magistrate Judge be and hereby is AFFIRMED.
