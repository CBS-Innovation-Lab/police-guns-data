                  ASSENTED-TO MOTION TO EXCLUDE DELAY
                       UNDER THE SPEEDY TRIAL ACT

     Counsel for the defendant Ernest Edwards respectfully moves

this Court for an order of excludable delay pursuant to 18 U.S.C.

§3161.    As grounds for this motion, undersigned counsel states

that at the defendant’s request, the court ordered the U.S.

Probation Department to prepare a pre-plea presentence report on

March 31, 2008.     The motion was filed on February 19, 2008.

This report has not yet been finished.        This matter is set for a

status conference on July 16, 2008, by which time the pre-plea

presentence report should be done.        Judge Marianne Bowler had

previously entered an order of excludable delay through March 4,

2008.

     By this motion, the defendant seeks to exclude the period

between March 4, 2008 and July 16, 2008, the date of the next

hearing, as delay that is excludable pursuant to 18 U.S.C.

§3161(h)(1)(F) the Speedy Trial Act,.

     Wherefore, for the above-stated reasons the defendant

respectfully requests that the period between March 4, 2008 and

July 16, 2008 be excluded from the running of the speedy trial
