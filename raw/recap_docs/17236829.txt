GORTON, J.

     The defendant is charged with one count of being a felon in

possession of a firearm and ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C.

§ 922(g)(1).     He has moved to suppress evidence discovered in

connection with a vehicle stop and statements made after that

stop.

     A.      Factual Background

     The government alleges, and has submitted supporting

affidavits, that the following events occurred on November 5,

2007.     On that morning the Massachusetts State Police received

several reports that a blue Nissan Maxima, with Massachusetts

plate number 85AE76, was being operated erratically.            Trooper

Richard Gaudet (“Gaudet”) subsequently observed the vehicle

traveling north on Route 128 in Lynnfield, Massachusetts.            Gaudet

observed the vehicle being driven in an erratic manner, weaving

in and out of marked lanes and at one point almost hitting the

                                     -1-
     Case 1:07-cr-10435-NMG Document 23 Filed 12/15/08 Page 2 of 12



center barrier of the highway.     Upon witnessing this he activated

his lights and the car came to a stop in the left travel lane of

Route 128.

     Gaudet approached the vehicle and observed three occupants:

a female driver, a young girl in the front passenger seat and a

male passenger, later identified as the defendant Moises Cintron

(“Cintron”), in the back seat.     Cintron was lying across the back

seat and appeared to be asleep or unconscious.

     Gaudet asked the driver to get out of the vehicle and

another Trooper who had arrived on the scene knocked on the rear

passenger window in an effort to wake Cintron.        When Cintron did

not respond the Trooper opened the car door, shook him and, when

he awoke, ordered him out of the car.      As Cintron was getting out

Gaudet, who was on the driver’s side, saw the black handle of

what appeared to be a handgun in Cintron’s left jacket pocket.

Upon seeing this Gaudet ran around to the passenger side of the

car, grabbed Cintron’s pocket and, upon feeling what he believed

to be a handgun, removed the weapon.      Cintron was placed under

arrest for possession of a handgun.

     Following his arrest, but later on the same day, Cintron was

interviewed by Special Agent Michael Turner (“Turner”) of the

Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.         Turner

began the interview by reading Cintron his Miranda warnings and

obtaining a signed waiver.    When asked his name by Turner,


                                  -2-
      Case 1:07-cr-10435-NMG Document 23 Filed 12/15/08 Page 3 of 12



Cintron responded “Elizear Caceres.”       Turner knew that

fingerprints had identified the defendant as Cintron and upon

further questioning Cintron admitted his true identity.          He also

told Turner that he had purchased the firearm from a black male

in Brockton, Massachusetts, for $250.       Turner knew that Cintron

had previously told Massachusetts State Police that he purchased

the gun for $150.    Turner spoke with Cintron again on January 7,

2008, at which time Cintron again told him that he purchased the

firearm for $250 from a “drug guy” on the street.

      B.   Procedural History

      Cintron was indicted on December 19, 2007 and filed the

pending motion to suppress on July 18, 2008.        In that motion he

requests an evidentiary hearing.      A non-evidentiary status

conference was held on October 21, 2008.        At that conference the

Court determined that an evidentiary hearing would be necessary

but granted the government time to file supplemental affidavits

in an effort to eliminate the need for such a hearing.          The Court

also granted the defendant an opportunity to respond with

counter-affidavits within 10 days of the government’s filing.

      After being granted an extension, the government filed

affidavits of two law enforcement officers on November 26, 2008.

The defendant has filed no affidavits in response.

II.   Defendant’s Motion to Suppress

      In evaluating Cintron’s motion to suppress, the Court


                                   -3-
     Case 1:07-cr-10435-NMG Document 23 Filed 12/15/08 Page 4 of 12



scrutinizes separately each step of the interaction between the

police and the defendant.      With respect to each step the Court

must determine whether it was justified by the information known

to officers at that time.      United States v. McKoy, 428 F.3d 38,

39 (1st Cir. 2005).    In this case Cintron challenges the

validity, scope and duration of the traffic stop.        He asserts

that all evidence obtained subsequently, including the seized

handgun and his statements to law enforcement, are fruit of the

poisonous tree.    He also contends that his statements were

involuntary and not made pursuant to a knowing and intentional

waiver of his Miranda rights.

     A.     The Initial Stop

            1.    Legal Standard

     The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution

guarantees each citizen the right to be free from unreasonable

searches and seizures.    Police officers may, however, approach

citizens and investigate potential criminal activity even without

probable cause to make an arrest for the purposes of crime

prevention and detection.      Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 22 (1968).

An officer may conduct a brief investigatory stop if he has

“reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity is

afoot.”    United States v. Romain, 393 F.3d 63, 71 (1st Cir.

2004).    Reasonable suspicion must be based on specific and

articulable facts taken together with the rational inferences to


                                   -4-
     Case 1:07-cr-10435-NMG Document 23 Filed 12/15/08 Page 5 of 12



be drawn from those facts.    United States v. Woodrum, 202 F.3d 1,

6 (1st Cir. 2000).   The government bears the burden of proving

that a vehicle stop without a warrant was justified.         United

States v. Monteiro, 447 F.3d 39, 43 (1st Cir. 2006).         A court

must look at the totality of the circumstances in order to

determine the reasonableness of the stop.       United States v.

Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 417 (1981).

     A traffic stop is generally reasonable if “the police have

probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has occurred.”

Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 810 (1996).        Furthermore,

the fact that a traffic violation operates merely as a pretext

for stopping motorists about whom the police harbor unrelated

suspicions is irrelevant to the Fourth Amendment analysis.            Id.

at 813 (“subjective intentions play no role in ordinary,

probable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis”).

          2.   Application

     The government has established through affidavits that

officer Gaudet observed the vehicle in which Cintron was a

passenger being driven erratically, weaving in and out of lanes

and almost hitting a barrier in the median.        The defendant

responds that any traffic violations that were allegedly observed

were a pretext for the vehicle stop in question.        Regardless of

subjective intentions, however, Whren clearly establishes that a

stop is reasonable if officers have probable cause to believe a


                                  -5-
     Case 1:07-cr-10435-NMG Document 23 Filed 12/15/08 Page 6 of 12



traffic violation occurred.    517 U.S. at 810.       Here, Trooper

Gaudet observed what he believed were several traffic violations

thus justifying his stop of the vehicle.

     B.    Scope of the Stop

           1.   Legal Standard

     Officers making a traffic stop do not violate the Fourth

Amendment by requiring the driver and passengers to exit the

vehicle.   Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U.S. 106, 109-11 (1977)

(driver); Maryland v. Wilson, 519 U.S. 408, 415 (1997)

(passengers).   Furthermore, police actions that might otherwise

exceed the permissible scope of a vehicle stop do not violate the

Fourth Amendment if they fall within the so-called “community

caretaking” doctrine.    See Lockhart-Bembery v. Sauro, 498 F.3d

69, 75 (1st Cir. 2007).    That doctrine permits warrantless

searches and seizures when they relate to

     community caretaking functions, totally divorced from
     the detection, investigation, or acquisition of
     evidence relating to the violation of a criminal
     statute.

Cady v. Dombrowski, 413 U.S. 433, 441 (1973).       Responding to

vehicle-related problems often falls under the caretaking role of

law enforcement.   United States v. Rodriguez-Morales, 929 F.2d

780, 785 (1st Cir. 1991).

     2.    Application

     Cintron’s motion to suppress does not specify how the

vehicle search in this case exceeded the permissible scope.

                                  -6-
     Case 1:07-cr-10435-NMG Document 23 Filed 12/15/08 Page 7 of 12



Nevertheless, a review of the actions taken by law enforcement

demonstrates that the Fourth Amendment was not violated.

     Removal of the vehicle’s occupants was clearly permissible

even absent a showing of probable cause.       See    Mimms, 434 U.S. at

109-11; Wilson, 519 U.S. at 415.     Opening the door and shaking

Cintron to awaken him also did not violate the Fourth Amendment

because of the community caretaker doctrine.         That act was not

undertaken by the state police as part of their investigation but

rather out of concern for Cintron’s safety.       See Dombrowski, 413

U.S. at 441.    Here, two reasons justified waking Cintron.       First,

he was unresponsive and lying across the back seat of the car.

It was certainly reasonable to believe he might need medical

attention.    Second, the vehicle had come to a stop in the passing

lane on a major highway.    The state police had a legitimate

concern that the removal of all occupants was necessary to ensure

their safety and Cintron could not be removed without being

awakened.

     To the extent that Cintron challenges these aspects of the

search, his contentions are without merit.       The actions of the

state police were justified and did not violate the Fourth

Amendment.

     C.     Seizure of the Gun

     With respect to the seizure of the gun from his person,

Cintron argues that the doctrine of plain view is inapplicable


                                  -7-
     Case 1:07-cr-10435-NMG Document 23 Filed 12/15/08 Page 8 of 12



because officers had unlawfully seized the vehicle and its

occupants prior to observing the weapon.       That assertion is based

on the premise that the traffic stop and the subsequent “seizure”

of occupants were a violation of the Fourth Amendment.         Having

already determined that those actions were permissible, this

Court finds Cintron’s argument with respect to plain view to be

without merit.   Trooper Gaudet states in his sworn affidavit that

he observed the gun protruding from Cintron’s pocket as Cintron

got out of the vehicle and thus its seizure, pursuant to the

doctrine of plain view, was amply justified.       See, e.g., United

States v. Taylor, 511 F.3d 87, 92 (1st Cir. 2007) (noting that

plain view applies where officers observed the butt of a firearm

protruding from under a towel during a traffic stop).

     D.   Voluntariness of Cintron’s Statements

     Cintron also asserts that any statements he made following

the vehicle stop are fruit of the poisonous tree and were

involuntary and not made pursuant to a knowing and intentional

waiver of his Miranda rights.     Having already determined that no

Fourth Amendment violation occurred, Cintron’s fruits argument

can be readily disposed of.

     With respect to the voluntariness of his statements and his

waiver of Miranda rights, Cintron does not specify how either

were constitutionally deficient nor does he identify specific

statements that he seeks to suppress.      His motion simply requests


                                  -8-
     Case 1:07-cr-10435-NMG Document 23 Filed 12/15/08 Page 9 of 12



that all statements made 1) at the scene of his arrest, 2) en

route to police facilities or 3) at the police station, be

suppressed.   The government bears the burden of proving a waiver

of Miranda by a preponderance of the evidence.        United States v.

Downs-Moses, 329 F.3d 253, 267 (1st Cir. 2003).

     The government has identified the following statements made

by Cintron to police following his arrest:

     1)   statements to Trooper Stevie Browning (“Browning”),
          made on the day of the arrest, in which Cintron falsely
          identified himself and said that he purchased the gun
          for $150;

     2)   statements to Gaudet, made on the day of the arrest at
          the Danvers Police Station, in which he said he
          purchased the gun for $400;

     3)   statements to Turner, made on the day of the arrest, in
          which Cintron confirmed his true identity and explained
          how he obtained the gun for a price of $250; and

     4)   statements to Turner on January 7, 2008, in which he
          said that he bought the gun from a “drug guy” on the
          street for $250.

The government asserts that all of those statements were preceded

by Miranda warnings.   Police reports submitted with the

government’s opposition indicate that Cintron was Mirandized by

Browning at the time of his arrest, at the scene and before

making the first two statements.     The reports also indicate that

he was Mirandized for a second time by Turner before making the

third and fourth statements.

     Despite the police reports, however, the only record

materials of evidentiary quality before this Court are the

                                  -9-
     Case 1:07-cr-10435-NMG Document 23 Filed 12/15/08 Page 10 of 12



affidavits of Gaudet and Turner.      Neither of those affidavits

establishes that Cintron was Mirandized at the time of his

arrest, or at any other time before being Mirandized by Turner.

Accordingly, there is no evidence in the record regarding whether

the first two statements (made to Browning and Gaudet) were made

after a valid waiver of Miranda rights.       An evidentiary hearing

is therefore necessary to determine whether those statements

should be suppressed.

     With respect to the third and fourth statements (made to

Special Agent Turner), the government has met its burden by

proffering an affidavit from Turner with a Miranda waiver signed

by Cintron.1   The defendant does not deny that he was given

Miranda warnings by Turner nor does he offer any reason why his

subsequent statements were involuntary.       Accordingly, any

statements made by Cintron after signing the waiver will not be

suppressed.

     E.   Need for an Evidentiary Hearing

     Although Cintron has requested an evidentiary hearing, such

hearings are required only when a defendant alleges facts that

are “sufficiently definite, specific, detailed, and

nonconjectural, to enable the court to conclude that a

substantial claim is presented.”      United States v. Lewis, 40 F.3d


     1
      Although the signature on the waiver appears to read
“Elizear Caceres,” Turner’s affidavit establishes that Cintron
attempted to use that alias and is unrefuted.

                                  -10-
     Case 1:07-cr-10435-NMG Document 23 Filed 12/15/08 Page 11 of 12



1325, 1332 (1st Cir. 1994) (citation and internal quotation marks

omitted).   A defendant must make a “sufficient threshold showing”

that “there are factual disputes which, if resolved in his favor,

would entitle him to the requested relief.”        United States v.

Staula, 80 F.3d 596, 603 (1st Cir. 1995); Lewis, 40 F.3d at 1332

(“The defendant must allege facts that, if proven, would entitle

him to relief.”).

     Based on the defendant’s allegations and the evidence

proffered, this Court concludes that a limited evidentiary

hearing is required to address only whether Cintron’s statements

to Gaudet and Browning (i.e., his first two statements) were

preceded by Miranda warnings.     Accordingly, an evidentiary

hearing will proceed as scheduled on December 19, 2008, but

testimony will be limited to the issue of whether Cintron was

given Miranda warnings at the time of his arrest.

     With respect to the remaining issues raised in Cintron’s

motion to suppress, there are no disputed facts that require an

evidentiary hearing.    The government has submitted two affidavits

detailing the circumstances of Cintron’s arrest but Cintron has

submitted no affidavit in response and the relevant facts related

to his arrest are unrefuted.     Cintron’s affidavit, submitted

contemporaneously with his motion to suppress, establishes only

that he did not consent to being stopped, arrested or searched.

Because consent is neither in dispute nor necessary to validate a


                                  -11-
     Case 1:07-cr-10435-NMG Document 23 Filed 12/15/08 Page 12 of 12



search, Cintron has not shown a factual dispute requiring an

evidentiary hearing.    See Staula, 80 F.3d at 603.



                                 ORDER

     In accordance with the foregoing, Cintron’s motion to

suppress (Docket No. 15) is, with the exception of statements

made to Troopers Gaudet and Browning after his arrest, DENIED.

The Court reserves its ruling on the remaining statements until

after the evidentiary hearing.
