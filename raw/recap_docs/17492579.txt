                         MEMORANDUM AND ORDER

WILLIAM E. SMITH, United States District Judge.

     Alejandro R. Pujols-Tineo      (“Pujols”) has filed a motion to

vacate, set aside or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §

2255 (ECF No. 174) in each of the above matters.        For the reasons

that follow, that motion is denied.

I.   FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND TRAVEL

     Pujols, a native of the Dominican Republic, was charged with

conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more

of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B) and

846 (Count I); and possession with intent to distribute 500 grams

or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and

(b)(1)(B) (Count II).    He pled guilty to these charges.

     Separately,    Pujols   was   charged   with   illegal   reentry   in

violation of 8 U.S.C. §§ 1326(a) and (b)(2).        See United States v.
                                                                         1
Pujols-Tineo, CR 06-025 S.     He also pled guilty to this charge.

     1
       Under the terms of both plea agreements, in exchange for the
Pujols’s plea of guilty to his respective offenses, the Government
agreed to recommend a sentence at the lowest end of the applicable
guideline range or the mandatory minimum sentence, whichever was
applicable, and a two- or three-level reduction in offense level
for acceptance of responsibility. (See Plea Agreement ¶ 2, CR 05-
137 S, Feb. 28, 2006, ECF No. 42; Plea Agreement ¶ 2, CR 06-025 S,
Feb. 28, 2006, ECF No. 8.) Both plea agreements also provided that
the Government’s sentencing recommendations were not binding on
In the course of this plea, Pujols admitted that he was deported on

two separate occasions (in 1991 and again in 1997) after having

been convicted of drug offenses or crimes of violence and illegally

reentered this country after each removal.    ( See Change of Plea

Hr’g Tr. CR 06-025 S at 9-11, Apr. 4, 2006 (“4/4/06 Plea Tr.”).)

Thereafter, his illegal reentry case was consolidated with his drug

case.

     In all proceedings in this Court as to both prosecutions,

Pujols was represented by Assistant Federal Defender Edward C. Roy

(“Roy”).   There is no indication in the record as to whether law

enforcement notified the consulate of the Dominican Republic of

Pujols’s arrest and detention or whether Pujols’s counsel advised

him of his right to such notification.

     The Presentence Report (“PSR”) prepared by the U.S. Probation

Office found that Pujols was a career offender which resulted in a

net offense level of 31 (after a 3-level reduction for acceptance

of responsibility), a criminal history category VI and an advisory

guideline range of 188–235 months imprisonment.       Attorney Roy

objected to the PSR on behalf of Pujols, including an objection to

the career offender designation. At the sentencing hearing on July

14, 2006, this Court rejected Pujols’s objections and sentenced him

to 216 months in prison, the mid-point of the applicable guideline

range.   (See Sentencing Hr’g Tr. CR No. 05-137 T and CR No. 06-025
T at 6-7, 14-19 (“Sent. Tr.”).)


this Court and that the Court alone would make all sentencing
decisions. (ECF No. 42, ¶ 9; ECF No. 8, ¶ 9.)
                                  2
      Pujols appealed to the First Circuit, arguing (1) ineffective

assistance due to trial counsel’s request for a below-guidelines

sentence, allegedly in violation of the plea agreement, and (2) the

lack of an interpreter at certain key proceedings.      The Court of

Appeals deemed the ineffective assistance claim premature and

otherwise affirmed Pujols’s conviction and sentence on October 30,

2007.      Pujols did not seek further review, and his conviction

became final 90 days later, on January 28, 2008.
                                                          2
      Pujols then filed the instant motion to vacate.         In his

motion, Pujols asserts claims of ineffective assistance of counsel

and the violation of his right to notify the consulate of his home

country of his arrest and prosecution, and also challenges the

jurisdiction of this Court over his offenses.3
II.   DISCUSSION

      A.     Ineffective Assistance - Sentencing

      Pujols first claims that his counsel, after learning that

Pujols had attempted to obtain new counsel to represent him at



      2
      There has been a dispute about whether the motion was timely
filed. The Court need not address the issue because the motion,
even if timely filed, is without merit.
      3
       Although Pujols requests an evidentiary hearing on his
claims, no hearing is required because, as discussed infra, the
files and records of this case conclusively establish that his
claim is without merit. See David v. United States, 134 F.3d 470,
477 (1st Cir. 1998) (district court properly may forego any hearing
“when (1) the motion is inadequate on its face, or (2) the movant's
allegations, even if true, do not entitle him to relief, or (3) the
movant's allegations need not be accepted as true because they
state conclusions instead of facts, contradict the record, or are
inherently incredible.”) (internal quotations and citation
omitted).
                                   3
sentencing, acted in a retaliatory manner by requesting a sentence

below the applicable advisory guideline range, which violated

Pujols’s plea agreement and resulted in a longer sentence.             (Mot.

to Vacate - Ground One; Mem. of Law in Support of Mot. [to Vacate
                                                                   4
pursuant to] 28 U.S.C. § 2255 at 2-4 (“Pet’r’s Mem.”).)                Pujols

further claims that counsel failed to advise him that he could

withdraw his plea under Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(d)(2)(A) after the

sentencing   court   rejected   his   plea,   and   failed    to   request   a

continuance to permit Pujols to do so.         (Id. at 2.)5

     A defendant who claims that he was deprived of his Sixth

Amendment    right   to   effective       assistance   of    counsel     must

demonstrate:

     (1)    That his counsel’s performance fell below an
            objective standard of reasonableness; and
     (2)    [A] reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s
            unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding
            would have been different.

Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 694 (1984); accord
United States v. Manon, 608 F.3d 126, 131 (1st Cir. 2010).

     For a court to assess the adequacy of counsel’s performance,

a defendant “‘must identify the acts or omissions of counsel that

     4
       Pujols asserts, “because counsel was upset over the fact
that the petitioner hired another attorney[,] making him look bad,
[h]e knew the only way to retaliate would be to violate the plea
[agreement], and subject the petitioner to a much harsher sentence
‘Which he did’”. (Pet’r’s Mem. at 4.)
     5
       This latter claim is confusingly worded.     Pujols asserts
that his counsel “did not object to the continuation of sentencing”
after the court “reject[ed] his plea” (Pet’r’s Mem. 2), and later
that counsel “did not fully explain to him that if the plea was
rejected before sentencing, he had a right to withdraw his plea.”
(Id. at 3.) This Court construes the claim as set forth above.
                                      4
are alleged not to have been the result of reasonable professional

judgment,’ and the court must then determine whether, in the

particular context, the identified conduct or inaction was ‘outside

the wide range of professionally competent assistance.’”           Manon,

608 F.3d at     131 (quoting   Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690).            With

respect to the prejudice requirement a “reasonable probability is

one sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. . . . In

making   the   prejudice   assessment,   [the   court]   focuses   on   the

fundamental fairness of the proceeding.” Manon, 608 F.3d at 131-32
(citations and internal quotations omitted); accord United States

v. Theodore, 468 F.3d 52, 56 (1st Cir. 2006).

     Neither of Pujols’s claims has merit. As to counsel’s request

for a below-guidelines sentence, Roy made a reasoned calculation

that because the minimum sentence under the applicable advisory

guideline range was more than 15 years, Pujols had little to lose

by requesting a sentence below the guideline range.        The fact that

he was unsuccessful does not render his performance deficient. See

Myles v. Dahlberg, 937 F.2d 609, *2 (6th Cir. 1991) (Table) (“Just

because a lawyer loses on a point does not mean that the lawyer was

‘ineffective’ for constitutional purposes.”).6




     6
       Contrary to Pujols’s contention, the request for a below-
guidelines sentence did not violate the plea agreement, as that
agreement merely provided that if Pujols requested such a sentence,
the Government was not required to recommend a sentence at the
bottom of the applicable guideline range. ( See Plea Agreement ¶
2.a, ECF No. 42.)       For the same reason, the Government’s
recommendation of a higher (220-month) sentence than that
contemplated in the plea agreement did not violate that agreement.
In any event, both parties were aware, and the plea agreements
expressly provided, that the Court was not bound by the
recommendations in the respective plea agreements. (Id. ¶ 9.)
                                 5
     Pujols’s assertion that counsel’s action was retaliatory is

contradicted by the record.   At the sentencing hearing, Roy stated

to the Court that he had anticipated that new counsel would be

appearing on behalf of Pujols at the sentencing hearing, that he

had been advised by the putative counsel’s office that a memorandum

would be filed but nothing was filed, and that for that reason he

had not filed a written motion for a below-guidelines sentence.

(See Sent Tr. at 7.)   Roy further informed this Court that Pujols

had asked him to make the request for a below-guidelines sentence.

(Id. at 8.)7   This belies any retaliatory motive or action on the

part of Roy.    Pujols has produced no evidence to the contrary.

Thus, based on the record this Court rejects any claim that he

acted in a retaliatory manner in order to harm Pujols.

     The fact that under the terms of the plea agreement the

request for a below-guidelines sentence enabled the Government to

request a higher sentence does not mean that Pujols was prejudiced
                                           8
or that the plea agreement was breached.       At Pujols sentencing

hearing, Senior Judge Torres stated that he normally began at the

midpoint in the guideline range and that in this case he simply did


     7
       Puljos’ belated assertion that “he never made any such
request” (Traverse to Government’s Response 3, (ECF No. 206)) is
not sworn to and need not be considered by this Court. Gonzalez-
Gonzalez v. United States, 49 Fed. Appx. 322, 323 (1st Cir. 2002)
(“Facts alluded to in an unsworn memorandum are not sufficient.”).

     8
       The decision in United States v. Riggs, 287 F.3d 221 (1st
Cir. 2002), raised by Pujols in his Supp. Reply (at 2-3), does not
assist his claim that the Government breached the plea agreement.
In Riggs, the Government failed to recommend a sentence based on a
drug quantity of five-to-fifty grams of crack cocaine, as provided
in the plea agreement, and instead recommended a sentence based on
480 grams of crack cocaine; Riggs was sentenced based on that drug
quantity. Id. at 224. Nothing of the sort occurred here.
                                 6
not find any factors to cause him to impose a lower sentence.      (See

Sent. Tr. at 14-18.)         Senior Judge Torres did not adopt the

sentence proposed by the Government (220 months imprisonment), and

he considered the factors under 18 U.S.C. § 3553, including a

letter from Pujols’s wife asserting that Pujols was a good father

to his four children before imposing the sentence.       (Id.)

      Pujols is likewise mistaken in his assertion that counsel

should have requested a continuance of sentencing after the Court

rejected his plea.       The Court did not “reject” Pujols’s plea.

Rather, Senior Judge Torres simply chose to impose a sentence in

the middle of the applicable advisory guideline range.

      For all these reasons, Pujols’s ineffective assistance claims

are without merit, as they show neither deficient performance nor

prejudice.    See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687-88.

      B.     Claims under Vienna Convention

      Pujols next claims that his consular rights under the Geneva

Convention were violated in his prosecution.       He asserts that his

requests for permission to contact the consulate of the Dominican

Republic, his native country, to advise it of his arrest and to

request counsel from his native country were ignored by both police

and his counsel.      (Mot. to Vacate - Ground Two, Pet’r’s Mem. at 4-

5.)

      The    Vienna   Convention   on   Consular   Relations   (“Vienna

Convention”) requires consular notification when a foreign national

is arrested.9    See Baires v. United States, 707 F. Supp. 2d 656,


      9
       Pujols mistakenly refers to the Vienna Convention in his
motion, a mistake he concedes in his supplemental reply. The Court
construes the claim as one under the Vienna Convention.
                                 7
663 n.4 (E.D. Va. 2010) (citing Art. 36, Vienna Convention on

Consular Relations, 21 U.S.T. 77 (Dec. 14, 1969)).10

     To the extent Pujols’s Vienna Convention claim is asserted as

a direct claim, it is procedurally barred, as Pujols did not raise


     10
        Courts have noted that “[w]hen a foreign national is
detained, Article 36 imposes three obligations on the arresting
authority. The law enforcement agency must: (1) inform the
consulate of a foreign national's arrest or detention without
delay; (2) forward communications from a detained national to the
consulate without delay; and (3) inform a detained foreign national
of his rights under Article 36 without delay.” Sandoval v. United
States, 574 F.3d 847, 850 (7th Cir. 2009) (internal quotations and
citation omitted). “In addition to providing a ‘cultural bridge’
between the foreign detainee and the American legal system, the
consulate may also ‘conduct its own investigations, file amicus
briefs and even intervene directly in a proceeding if it deems that
necessary.’” Id. (quoting Osagiede v. United States, 543 F.3d 399,
403 (7th Cir. 2008)).
     Whether the right to consular notification is an individually
enforceable right is the subject of considerable debate by the
courts.   See Medellin v. Texas , 552 U.S. 491, 506, n.4 (2008)
(assuming without deciding that right to consular notification is
an individually enforceable right); Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, 548
U.S. 331 (2006) (same); compare, e.g., Cornejo v. County of San
Diego, 504 F.3d 853, 859-64 (9th Cir. 2007) (concluding that
Article 36's obligation to inform aliens of their right to consular
notification does not create judicially enforceable individual
rights); United States v. Emuegbunam, 268 F.3d 377, 391-94 (6th
Cir. 2001) (same), and United States v. Jimenez-Nava, 243 F.3d 192,
196-98 (5th Cir. 2001) (same), with Jogi v. Voges , 480 F.3d 822,
834-35 (7th Cir. 2007) (concluding that Article 36 creates
individual rights to be informed of consular notification), and
Osagiede, 543 F.3d at 402 (same). In the only case in which the
issue arose, the First Circuit did not conclusively resolve the
question and presented similarly divergent conclusions.     Compare
United States v. Li, 206 F.3d 56, 66-68 (1st Cir. 2000) (en banc)
(Selya and Boudin, JJ., concurring) (suggesting that individual
rights are not created), with Li, 206 F.3d at 68-76 (Torruella, J.,
concurring in part; dissenting in part) (concluding that Article 36
creates a judicially enforceable individual right to be advised
about the prospect of consular assistance).
     This Court need not resolve the question in this case because
even assuming that the right to consular notification is an
individually enforceable right, it is asserted here in the context
of a Sixth Amendment ineffective assistance claim, see infra, and
will be so adjudicated. See Osagiede, 543 F.3d at 408 (noting that
“Sanchez-Llamas appears to express a preference” that Vienna
Convention claims be brought as part of “broader constitutional
attacks”).
                                 8
it at any stage of the proceedings either before the district court

or on direct appeal, and he does not show cause or prejudice   See

Owens v. United States, 483 F.3d 48, 56-57 (1st Cir. 2007) (citing

United States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 168 (1982)).
     Pujols further contends, however, that his counsel failed to

act on his request to contact his consulate and states in his

Supplemental Reply that he intended to assert this claim “in the

context of ineffective assistance of counsel.”    (Supp. Reply 4.)

Even if construed as alleging ineffective assistance of counsel,

the claim does not warrant relief. First, beyond asserting that he

requested both law enforcement and his counsel to notify his

consulate, Pujols provides no details of those requests.    He has

thus not shown that his counsel performed deficiently.   See Duran-

Martinez v. United States, No. 07-C-536, 2007 WL 3342585 at *2

(E.D. Wis. Nov. 8, 2007) (rejecting ineffective assistance claim

based on failure to investigate violations of consular notification

rights under Vienna Convention, where petitioner “fail[ed] to

provide the court any specific facts as to whether he requested

consular notification, what he asked his attorney to investigate,

how her investigation was deficient”).

     Second, even assuming that no consular notification occurred11
and that Pujols’s counsel unreasonably failed to advise Pujols of

his right to such notification, Pujols has not shown how he was

     11
       The Government’s contention that Magistrate Judges routinely
inquire in cases involving detained aliens as to whether consular
notification has taken place and that the Bureau of Immigration and
Customs Enforcement (ICE), and its predecessor INS, routinely make
consular notifications when aliens are detained pending criminal
prosecution (Gov’t. Supp. Mem. 16), does not show that the consular
notification occurred in this case, and this Court does not so
find.
                                 9
prejudiced, so as to satisfy the second prong of the Strickland

standard.    Specifically, he does not allege how he was prejudiced

and how the result of the proceedings would have been different had

the required consular notification taken place.        Nor does he

explain how assistance from the Dominican Republic consulate could

have produced a better result for him.   Moreover, at his change of

plea hearing, Pujols admitted that he was guilty of drug charges

and that he had reentered the country illegally on two separate

occasions after committing crimes.    ( See 4/4/06 Plea Tr. 9-11.)
Thus, this Court finds that it is highly unlikely that notice to

the Dominican Republic consulate would have changed the result in

this case, or have resulted in a lower sentence.12

     Other courts have reached a similar conclusion.     See, e.g.,

Sandoval v. United States, 574 F.3d 847, 850-51 (7th Cir. 2009)

(affirming denial of § 2255 relief where petitioner failed to show

whether and how Mexican consulate would have assisted in his

defense); Baires, 707 F. Supp. 2d 656 (no prejudice resulting from

belated consular notification); Duran-Martinez, 2007 WL 3342585 at

*2 (finding no prejudice from counsel’s failure to investigate

violations    of   consular   notification   rights   under   Vienna

Convention); see also Breard v. Greene, 523 U.S. 371, 377 (1998)


     12
       Two cases cited by Pujols do not help him. Sanchez-Llamas,
548 U.S. 331, does not support his position but, if relevant at
all, actually suggests the opposite result, as the Supreme Court
held that a Vienna Convention violation does not trigger the
exclusionary rule.    Id. at 348-50. In     Osagiede, the Seventh
Circuit, in the course of remanding the case for an evidentiary
hearing on petitioner’s consular notification claim under Article
36, noted that petitioner still had to “more than show a credible
indication of the services [his] consulate would have provided.”
543 F.3d at 413 n.13. Here, Pujols has not shown even a credible
indication of such services.
                                10
(finding     it    “extremely     doubtful       that    [a   Vienna    Convention]

violation should result in the overturning of a final judgment of

conviction without some showing that the violation had an effect on

the trial”).

     Because      Pujols    has   not    shown    prejudice,     his    ineffective

assistance    claim    concerning        consular       notification    fails.   See

Strickland, 466 U.S. at 692.

     C.    Jurisdictional Claims

     Pujols       further   claims      that   the   crimes    in    question    were

“committed against a state within North America,” that there are no

states that were ceded to the United States and that therefore,

this Court had neither territorial jurisdiction nor subject matter

jurisdiction over him or his offenses.                   (Mot. to Vacate, Ground

Three; Pet’r’s Mem. 5-16.)         Specifically, Pujols contends that the

United States did not have territorial jurisdiction over the “exact

geographical location” of the crime, but does not state where the

“exact geographical location” is.                Similarly, Pujols postulates

that without the production of certain documents demonstrating,

inter alia, that all states in the union have relinquished their
jurisdiction to the Federal Government, then the Federal Government

does not have subject matter jurisdiction over him.13
     Neither claim warrants extended discussion.                    His territorial

claim -- that this Court did not have jurisdiction to adjudicate

his criminal offense because the property on which it occurred was


     13
        Pujols’s rambling and disorganized discussion of his
jurisdictional claims includes allegations that he was “Kidnapped”
by federal authorities and reliance on the Articles of
Confederation and case law dating back to 1818. (Pet’r’s Mem. 5,
10-12.)
                                11
not owned or administered by the federal government -- has been

rejected as a “silly claim” by several courts of appeals, including

the First Circuit.          See United States v. Lussier, 929 F.2d 25, 27

(1st Cir. 1991) (citing United States v. Koliboski, 732 F.2d 1328,

1329 (7th Cir. 1984) and cases cited therein). “It is well settled

that a district court has personal jurisdiction over any party who

appears before it, regardless of how his appearance was obtained.”

Id.

       As   to    subject     matter   jurisdiction,      18   U.S.C.   §   3231

indisputably gives the district courts subject matter jurisdiction

over    “all     offenses    against   the   laws   of   the   United   States.”

Lussier, 929 F.2d at 27 (citations omitted).             See also Cantrell v.

Reno, 36 Fed. Appx. 651, 652 (1st Cir. 2002) (“The trial court's

jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. § 3231 is not restricted to crimes

occurring on federally owned property.”) (citing United States v.

Mundt, 29 F.3d 233, 237 (6th Cir.1994)). This category of offenses

includes drug offenses defined in Title 21.                See Prou v. United

States, 199 F.3d 37, 45 (1st Cir. 1999).

       Accordingly, Pujols’s jurisdictional claims fail.

       This Court has considered all of Pujols’s other arguments and

finds them to be without merit.14

       14
        Pujols briefly adverts to the failure of his appellate
counsel to raise the denial of his consular notification rights and
the jurisdictional issue on appeal. (Mot. to Vacate, Grounds Two,
Three.) Because he does not develop this argument, it need not be
addressed. See United States v. Jiminez, 498 F.3d 82, 88 (1st Cir.
2007) (noting “the well-settled appellate rule that ‘issues
adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort
at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.’”) (quoting United
States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990)). In any event,
                                 12
III. CONCLUSION

     For all of the foregoing reasons, Pujols’s claims must be

rejected and his motion to vacate is hereby DENIED and DISMISSED.

                RULING ON CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY

     Pursuant    to    Rule   11(a)   of   the   Rules   Governing   §   2255

Proceedings in the United States District Courts (“§ 2255 Rules”),

this Court hereby finds that this case is not appropriate for the

issuance of a certificate of appealability (COA), because Pujols

has failed to make a substantial showing of the denial of a

constitutional right as to any claim, as required by 28 U.S.C. §

2253(c)(2).

     Pujols is advised that any motion to reconsider this ruling

will not extend the time to file a notice of appeal in this matter.

See § 2255 Rule 11(a).



SO ORDERED:



/s/ William E. Smith
William E. Smith
United States District Judge
Date: March 10, 2011




in light of this Court’s conclusion, supra, that these claims are
without merit, failure to raise them on appeal does not amount to
ineffective assistance.
