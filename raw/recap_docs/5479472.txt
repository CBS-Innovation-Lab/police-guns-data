STATEMENT OF REASONS
Vll COURT DETERMINAT[ONS OF RESTITUTlON
A m Restitution Not Applieable.
B Total Amount of Restitution:
C Restitution not ordered (Cheek only one.):
l l:l For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3j\(A).
z I:l For offenses t`or which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663.‘\, restitution is not ordered because determining complex

issues of €aet and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(e)(3)(B)`

3 [:l For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines restitution is not
ordered because the complication and prolongation oi` the sentencing process resuiting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh

the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(l)(B)(ii].
