                       ORDER ON GOVERNMENT’S MOTION TO SEAL

        On December 6, 2005, the United States moved this Court to seal portions of a transcript

of the trial of Derek Leland. (Docket # 77).1 This Court denies the Government’s motion.

        The common law presumes a right of public access to judicial records. Siedle v. Putnam

Invs., Inc., 147 F.3d 7, 9 (1st Cir. 1998). This presumption stems from the premise that “public

monitoring of the judicial system fosters the important values of ‘quality, honesty and respect for

our legal system.’” Id. at 9-10 (quoting FTC v. Standard Fin. Mgmt. Corp., 830 F.2d 404, 410

(1st Cir. 1987)(citation omitted)). Further, the First Circuit has stated that the “mere fact that

judicial records may reveal potentially embarrassing information is not in itself sufficient reason

to block public access.” Id. at 10.

        The Government contends that the First Amendment would not be violated by continued

sealing. However, the First Amendment covers access to criminal trials, Richmond Newspapers,

Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 580 (1980), including juror voir dire, Press-Enterprise Co. v.

Superior Court, 464 U.S. 501, 509-10 (1984), and extending to trial-like preliminary hearings in

criminal cases. El Vocero v. Puerto Rico, 508 U.S. 147, 149-50 (1993). See In re Boston

Herald, Inc., 321 F.3d 174, 183 (1st Cir. 2003). It applies with equal force to trials that end

 Mr. Leland was acquitted by jury verdict dated September 23, 2005. (Docket # 69). He has no direct interest in the
Government’s motion and has not responded.

without conviction. Boston Herald, 321 F.3d at 183; Globe Newspaper Co. v. Pokaski, 868 F.2d

497, 505-07 (1st Cir. 1989).

         Here, the transcript reflects discussion and an initial evidentiary ruling concerning the

potential impeachment of a government witness. The ruling favored disclosure to the Defendant,

but was coupled with a strong hint that the information was so attenuated that it was unlikely to

be admissible even for impeachment purposes.2 The Government points out that the portion of

the transcript it seeks to seal took place in chambers, not in open court. However, assuming this

distinction could make a difference and this Court released only that portion that was aired in

open court, this would raise the possibility of an inherently misleading and incomplete partial

disclosure.

         The Government bases its main argument on 5 U.S.C. § 552a. Although this Court is

sensitive to the privacy concerns of governmental employees, those concerns cannot trump the

First Amendment or the public’s common law presumption of access to criminal trials,

particularly when the information concerns what transpired during the trial, lacks the indicia of

personal identification that motivated the enactment of the Privacy Act, and is remote and

inconsequential. See Kimberlin v. United States Dep’t of Justice, 788 F.2d 434, 436 (7th Cir.

1986).

         The Government points out that as of yet no one has sought access, and argues that there

is a difference between denying access to the transcript and placing it in the public domain. It

urges the Court to seal the transcript until access is sought and only then determine whether to

unseal. This point has some merit, especially if the public were aware of what took place in open

court and this awareness could lead an interested party to make a request for additional access.

 After the information was disclosed, the Defendant decided against attempting to use it against the government
witness.

But, here, this Court is not inclined to make a mountain out of what it characterized in open court

as not amounting to a “hill of beans”.
