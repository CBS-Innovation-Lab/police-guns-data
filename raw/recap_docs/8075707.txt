          MOTION TO ENLARGE TIME FOR FILING PRETRIAL MOTIONS

       Now comes the accused, Carlos Andrade, by and through his counsel, and moves this
Honorable Court to enlarge the time for filing pretrial motions for an additional thirty (30) days.
       In support of this motion counsel states that she will need the additional time to review
additional discovery recently received from the government with the defendant and prepare the
appropriate motions.
       The Government and public will not be prejudiced by the delay, but will be benefitted by the
assurance that the criminal justice system is dedicated to fairness for all parties. As such, the
interests of justice in allowing this excludable time outweigh the interests of the public and the
defendant in a speedy trial.
       The time requested under this motion should be deemed excludable under the Speedy Trial
Act, 18 USC ยง 3161(h)(8).
       The Government, through Assistant United States Attorney Gerard B. Sullivan, indicates it
has no objection to the granting of this motion.
