Re: USA v. Rey Fulcar, Case 23-CR-10053-DJC

Dear Judge Casper:

I am writing to express grave concern about delays in my case due to the inability of

my appointed counsel to give my case any time or attention on matters I have
specifically been bringing to their attention to move the case forward. There is a
basis to reopen the bail issue based on new information and I also made it clear I
want my right to a speedy trial respected so we need to get moving on suppression
issues as well any other issues that need to be addressed prior to trial. 1 am aware

that my counsel has now moved to withdraw so at this point my request is that Your

Honor ensure my rights are protected by expeditiously appointing a new attorney
who actually has the time to assist in my defense and who does not have an excessive
caseload that will hinder her/his ability to ensure my right to a speedy trial is
respected. Thank you for your time and attention Your Honor.
