MEMORANDUM AND ORDER REGARDING
DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
(Dkt. No. 237)
October 25, 2006
PONSOR, U.S.D.J.

On July 10, 2006, this court awarded counsel fees for
representation of Defendant in this matter in the amount of
$26,094.35. This award included a reduction of the
requested fee in the amount of $3,884.48, based upon
counsel’s repeated negligent misrepresentations that his
client required services of a Russian translator. In
addition to oral remarks, these misrepresentations were made
in writing on two occasions, October 27, 2005 and November
4, 2005. gee Dkt. Nos. 152 and 153.

Counsel's last-minute request for a Ukranian translator

delayed the trial for two days while the clerk located and

Case 3:02-cr-30043-I\/|AP Document 256 Filed 10/25/06 Page 2 of 2

brought to the court an interpreter competent in Ukranian.

Counsel is a respected practitioner who has represented
defendants competently before this court more than once, but
in this case his diligence unfortunately fell below the
required level. Counsel repeatedly informed the court that
a Russian translator would be needed, without, he concedes,
ever discussing the matter with his client. §g§ transcript
of November 9, 2005 hearing,r attached as Exhibit A, at 4.
Counsel’s responsibility was not onerous. All he had to do
was ask, and he didn't. As a result, the trial was
significantly disrupted; a modest reduction in counsel's
substantial fee is therefore appropriate.

For the foregoing reasons, Defendant’s Motion for
Reconsideration is hereby DENIED.

It is So Ordered.
