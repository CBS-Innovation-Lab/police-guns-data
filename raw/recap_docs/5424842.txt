v.
ROBERT KNOWLES,

Defendant, Appellant.

 

Before

Torruellar Lynch and Lipez,
Circuit Judges.

 

JUDGMENT
Entered: November 15, 2006

Appellant makes three challenges to his sentence, all of which

we reject. First, prior convictions can he found by the court,
under the preponderance Of the evidence standard. See United States
v. Ivery, 427 F.3d 69, 74 (1Sc Cir. 2006). Second, whether the

prior convictions should be considered "violent“ offenses for
purposes of the armed career criminal act is a question of law and

 

therefore a proper one for the district court. See United States
v. Shepard, 544 U.S. 13 (2005). Finally, one of the challenged
predicate offenses was for "escape," another was for attempted

escape. Every circuit to address the question has held escape to be
a violent felony. SeeL;e.g;, United States v. Childs, 403 F.3d 970
(8Ch Cir. 2005)(citing other Courts of Appeals and holding
"walkaway" escape a violent felony). Cf. United States v. Winn, 364

F.3d 7, ll (lSt Cir. 2004},(non-violent felony escape considered
crime of violence for purposes of career offender guideline
enhancement).

The government's motion for summary affirmance is granted.

The judgment is affirmed. See lSt C. R. 27(c).
