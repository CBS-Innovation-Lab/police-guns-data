                             MEMORANDUM AND ORDER


GORTON,    J.

     In September, 2015, this Court dismissed the habeas

petition of Shelton Lewis ("Lewis").          Lewis now requests a

Certificate of Appealability.

I.   Background

     In his habeas petition, Lewis challenged his conviction on

the ground that his sentence was unconstitutionally enhanced by

the application of a mandatory minimum based on the finding of

the judge, rather than a jury, that he "brandished" a firearm.

Lewis based this claim on the United States Supreme Court's

decision in Alleyne v. United States, 133 S.Ct. 2151            (2013).

     Although his petition was filed nearly eight years after

his conviction became final, Lewis argued that the Court should

find his petition timely under two different provisions of 28

U.S.C. § 2255.        First, Lewis averred that his petition was


                                      -1-
           Case 1:99-cr-10416-NMG Document 162 Filed 12/31/15 Page 2 of 5



timely under 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f)(3) because it was filed within
one year of the Supreme Court's decision in Alleyne which,
according to Lewis, recognized a new right retroactively

applicable to cases on collateral review.               Second, Lewis

submitted that equitable tolling should render his petition

timely under 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f)(1), which permits the filing of

a petition within one year of the date on which a judgment of

conviction becomes final.           In adopting the report and

recommendation of the Magistrate Judge, this Court rejected both

claims and dismissed the petition as untimely.               Lewis seeks a

Certificate of Appealability on both claims.

II.   Legal Analysis

      A.      Standard


      Section 2253(c) of Title 28 of the United States Code

provides that a Certificate of Appealability may issue ''only if

the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a

constitutional right." 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).               When the

district court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds

without reaching the prisoner's underlying constitutional claim,

a petitioner must demonstrate

      at least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable
      whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial
      of a     constitutional right         and that   jurists of   reason
      would find i t debatable whether the district court was
      correct in its procedural ruling.

Slack V. McDaniel,       529 U.S.    473,   484   (2000).

     The debatable-among-jurists-of-reason standard is a low

barrier.     A claim is considered "debatable" even if every

reasonable jurist would agree that the petitioner will not

prevail. Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 338 (2003).             With

respect to the district court's procedural ruling, no appeal is

warranted if a clear procedural bar is present.           In such a

circumstance,

     a reasonable jurist could not conclude either that the
     district court erred in dismissing the petition or
     that the petitioner should be allowed to proceed
     further.


McDaniel,    529 U.S. at 484.     When a habeas petition contains more

than one potential ground for relief, a court must state which

issues,    if any,   satisfy the standard set forth in § 2253(c)(2).

28 U.S.C.    §   2253(c) (3).

     B.      Application

     Lewis first argues that his petition was filed in a timely

manner under 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f)(3).         That statutory provision

permits the filing of a habeas petition within one year of a

decision of the Supreme Court recognizing a new right

retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.            Lewis's

petition was filed within one year of the Supreme Court's

decision in Alleyne,       the case on which he bases his substantive

claim.     Further, it is undisputed that Alleyne recognized a new

right.     No jurist of reason would, however, find debatable the


                                     -3-
           Case 1:99-cr-10416-NMG Document 162 Filed 12/31/15 Page 4 of 5



fact that the new right does not apply retroactively. See United
States V. Hoon, 762 F.3d 1172 (holding that no reasonable jurist
would question that Alleyne does not apply retroactively). Of
the numerous courts in various jurisdictions that have addressed
this issue, not one has held that Alleyne applies retroactively
to cases on collateral review.       See, e.g., Butterworth v. United
States, 775 F.3d 459, 464-65 (1st Cir. 2015); United States v.
Reyes, 755 F.3d 210, 213 (3d Cir. 2014).         Thus this Court
concludes that Lewis has not made a substantial showing on this
claim.


     Second, Lewis argues that equitable tolling should render
his petition timely under 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f)(1). Even if this
were true, however, Lewis would be procedurally barred from
asserting his constitutional claim because Alleyne^ s protection
does not operate retroactively.        No reasonable jurist would
suggest that the tolling of the time limitation in 28 U.S.C.
§ 2255(f)(1) would render Alleyne retroactively applicable to
Lewis's case. Accord Campos v. United States, 3:13-cv-2980-D,
2014 WL 3778157, at *4 (N.D. Tex. July 31, 2014).

      Therefore Lewis has not made the requisite showing           that

 jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district
 court was correct in its procedural ruling." McDaniel, 529 U.S.
 at 484.   Because a plain procedural bar is present in this case.

no appeal is warranted. Accordingly, the motion for a
Certificate of Appealability will be denied.
                                 ORDER



     In accordance with the foregoing, petitioner's motion for a
Certificate of Appealability is DENIED.


So ordered.
