                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 09-cr-67-PB

Leonard Corson


                                  O R D E R

     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

trial scheduled for June 2, 2009 as counsel has recently been

appointed and requests additional time to complete discovery and

engage in negotiations or prepare for trial.           The government does

not object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reasons and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from August 18, 2009 to October 6, 2009.              In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
