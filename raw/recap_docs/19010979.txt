                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 12-cr-89-PB

Jody Albert



                                  O R D E R


     The defendant has moved to continue the September 5, 2012

trial in the above case, citing the need for additional time to

complete discovery and engage in plea negotiations or prepare a

defense.     The government does not object to a continuance of the

trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reasons and in order to allow

the parties additional time to properly prepare for trial, the

court will continue the trial from September 5, 2012 to October

2, 2012.     In agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds

pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ' 3161(h)(7)(A) that for the above-stated

reasons, the ends of justice served in granting a continuance

outweigh the best interests of the public and the defendant in a

speedy trial.
