                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                       DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

             v.                              Case No. 08-cr-56-01-SM

Raymond Cole

                                    ORDER

      Defendant Raymond Cole has filed a motion to continue the final pretrial

conference and trial (document no. 70). Trial has been rescheduled for the July

2009 trial period. Defendant Cole shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights not

later than June 15, 2009. On the filing of such waiver, the continuance shall be

effective.

      The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18

U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would

unreasonably deny defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances.

      Final Pretrial Conference: July 6, 2009 at 11:30 a.m.

      Jury Selection: July 21, 2009 at 9:30 a.m.
