                   UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                        DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

            v.                                Case No. 07-cr-148-01-SM

Eric L. Savage


                                      ORDER



      Defendant's assented-to motion to continue the trial (document no. 10) is

granted. Trial has been rescheduled for the December 2007 trial period. Defendant

shall file a Waiver of Speedy Trial Rights not later than August 31, 2007. On the

filing of such waiver, his continuance shall be effective.

      The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C.

ยง 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would unreasonably deny

the defendant the reasonable time
