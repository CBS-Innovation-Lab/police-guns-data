            DEFENDANT/PETITIONER    )


     ORDER ON DEFENDANT/PETITIONER’S CONSOLIDATED MOTION


      The defendant/petitioner’s Consolidated Motion for, and Brief in Support

of: Correction of Court’s Findings or for Additional Findings re: Order of

July 18th, 2016 (ECF No. 217) is DENIED.       The Order concerning the Trial

Transcript is correct for the reasons stated in the Order.      I do make one

correction sua sponte: the Order cites an incorrect ECF filing.      The court

reporter’s recertification is not ECF No. 114, as the Order says, but rather ECF

No. 213.

      SO ORDERED.

      DATED THIS 30TH DAY OF SEPTEMBER, 2016

                                           /s/D. Brock Hornby
