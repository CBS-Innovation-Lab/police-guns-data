                             ORDER ON MOTION IN LIMINE


          Before the Court is the Government’s Motion in Limine to Admit Evidence of

   Firearm Recoveries (Docket # 107). Defendant asserts that this evidence should be

   excluded pursuant to Federal Rules of Evidence 403 and 404(b). (See Def.’s Resp.

   (Docket # 125).) As explained herein, the Court GRANTS the Government’s Motion in

   Limine (Docket # 107) pursuant to the limitations described herein and subject to the

   Government satisfying all other evidentiary requirements.

          Defendant is charged in a thirteen-count Superseding Indictment with several

   firearms offenses, as well as conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute

   cocaine base. (See Superseding Indictment (Docket # 44).) Count Three alleges that

   Defendant knowingly and intentionally conspired to willfully engage in the business of

   dealing firearms without being a licensed dealer of firearms.            (See id. at 5-6.)

   Specifically, the Government alleges that Defendant recruited others to purchase firearms

   in Maine, which he then transported to New York City for resale. (See Government’s

   Mot. (Docket # 107) at 1.) Counts Nine through Thirteen allege that Defendant, having

   been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year, knowingly

   possessed, in and affecting commerce, several firearms. (See Superseding Indictment

   (Docket # 44) at 9.)

           The Government now moves to admit evidence regarding the recovery of five

   firearms, four of which are specifically charged in the Superseding Indictment.1 All five

   firearms were purchased in Maine, during the period alleged in Count Three, by

   Defendant’s alleged co-conspirators. All five firearms were subsequently recovered in

   New York City during multiple arrests.              The Government claims that the evidence

   regarding the firearms’ recovery is intrinsic to the charged crimes; the evidence will

   corroborate anticipated witness testimony and establish that the Count Three conspiracy

   occurred in the manner alleged.

           In short, the Court agrees that because this evidence “comprises part and parcel of

   the charged offense[s],” it is intrinsic. United States v. Gobbi, 471 F.3d 302, 311 (1st

   Cir. 2006). Evidence regarding the recovery of the firearms, including the firearm not

   specifically charged in the Superseding Indictment, may assist the jury in concluding that

   the alleged conspirators were engaged in the business of selling in New York City

   firearms purchased in Maine. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 921(a)(11), (21). This evidence

   may also help to establish that the firearms specifically charged in Counts Nine through

   Thirteen were connected with interstate commerce. See id. § 922(g).

           Of course, the jury may in both cases reject the evidence as attenuated or

   inconclusive. But it is clearly direct proof of the charged crimes. See United States v.


   1
     The Cobra Enterprises .9 millimeter pistol, serial number CT020874, is charged in Counts Four and Nine;
   the Hi-Point Firearms .45 caliber pistol, serial number X432643, is charged in Counts Seven and Twelve;
   the Cobra Enterprises .9 millimeter pistol, serial number 01447, is charged in Counts Eight and Thirteen;
   and the Cobra Enterprises .380 caliber pistol, serial number FS010835, is charged in Counts Eight and
   Thirteen. The Taurus .9 millimeter pistol, serial number TSH03351, is not specifically charged in the
   Superseding Indictment; however, this firearm was purchased in Maine, during the period alleged in Count
   Three, by Defendant’s alleged co-conspirator.

   Ofray-Campos, 534 F.3d 1, 35 (1st Cir. 2008).          Accordingly, Rule 404(b), which

   prohibits “other acts” evidence introduced to demonstrate propensity, is not implicated.

   See Gobbi, 471 F.3d at 311.

          The Court must also consider whether the probative value of this evidence is

   “substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.” Fed. R. Evid. 403. As

   mentioned, these firearms were recovered during multiple arrests in New York City;

   Defendant was unconnected to all but one of these arrests. Thus, in order to mitigate the

   likelihood of unfair prejudice, the Court directs the Government to limit its presentation

   of this evidence to the time and place of recovery. The Government may not offer any

   evidence that the firearms were used in uncharged criminal activity.            Both the

   Government and Defendant are free to stipulate to facts otherwise necessary to ameliorate

   the possibility of unfair prejudice, and to raise this issue at trial should circumstances

   require.

          Accordingly, the Court GRANTS the Government’s Motion in Limine (Docket #

   107) pursuant to the limitations described herein.

          SO ORDERED.
