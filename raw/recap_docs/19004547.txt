      The order of May 18, 2012 is vacated.      Motion to continue (doc.

no. 58) is granted.    Case continued to the two-week period beginning

August 7, 2012, 9:30 a.m.       Counsel shall agree on a plea date at

earliest convenience.    Final Pretrial is rescheduled to July 31, 2012

at 10:00 a.m.

      Defendant shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights within 10

days.   The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting

a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ' 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv), for the

reasons set forth in the motion.

      SO ORDERED.
