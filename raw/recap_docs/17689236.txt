              ORDER AFFIRMING RECOMMENDED DECISION
                     OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE


      On May 23, 2012, the United States Magistrate Judge filed with the
court, with copies to the parties, her Recommended Decision on 28 U.S.C.
§ 2255 Motion. The time within which to file objections expired on June 11,
2012, and no objections have been filed.     The Magistrate Judge notified the
parties that failure to object would waive their right to de novo review and
appeal.
      It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the Magistrate
Judge is hereby ADOPTED. Preisel’s motion to vacate, set aside or correct his
sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 is DISMISSED.             No certificate of
appealability shall issue in the event Preisel files a notice of appeal because
there is no substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right within the
meaning of 28 U.S.C. 2253(c)(2).

      SO ORDERED.

      DATED THIS 20TH DAY OF JUNE, 2012

                                            /S/D. BROCK HORNBY
