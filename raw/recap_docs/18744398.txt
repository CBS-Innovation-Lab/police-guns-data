                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                        DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                                   Criminal No. 05-cr-037-01-SM

Ryan Nimblett

                                  O R D E R

     Defendant appeared for a bail revocation hearing.             Defendant

has already pled guilty.        Between November 8, 2004 and January

21, 2005, defendant failed to provide four urine samples as

directed.     He was out of monitoring range four times.          Since May

2005 he has failed to provide three samples as directed.                 He

admitted to one use of LSD on July 10, 2005 which he maintains

was involuntarily received while co-operating with Maine police.

Even crediting the latter he has been non-compliant.             Given the

number of failed opportunities to comply with conditions I find

that the defendant is unlikely to abide by any condition or

combination of conditions.        The conditions of release are

revoked.

     Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the defendant be detained

pending trial.

     The defendant is committed to the custody of the Attorney

General or his designated representative for confinement in a

corrections facility separate, to the extent practicable, from

persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody

pending appeal.     The defendant shall be afforded a reasonable

opportunity for private consultation with defense counsel.             On

order of a court of the United States or on request of an

attorney for the government, the person in charge of the

corrections facility shall deliver the defendant to the United

States Marshal for the purpose of an appearance in connection

with a court proceeding.

      SO ORDERED.
