             ORDER ON MOTION TO WITHDRAW GUILTY PLEA

       Alan Ketchen asserts that under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure

 11(d)(2)(B), he has demonstrated a “fair and just reason for requesting the

 withdrawal” of his May 7, 2014 guilty plea to two counts of a five-count indictment

 because, pursuant to the recent United States Supreme Court ruling of McFadden v.

 United States, 135 S. Ct. 2298 (2015), he claims this Court failed to explain the mens

 rea requirements of the crimes charged against him at his Rule 11 proceeding, and

 the Government could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew he was

 possessing and distributing a controlled substance analogue. The Court denies Mr.

 Ketchen’s motion because he pleaded guilty to Controlled Substances Act crimes

 unaffected by McFadden and because the Court concludes that he knowingly and

 voluntarily pleaded guilty to the Analogue Act portion of the charges.

 I.    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

       On July 17, 2013, a federal grand jury returned a five-count indictment against

 Mr. Ketchen and thirteen other conspiracy members for the distribution of a

 controlled substance and related firearm offenses.         Indictment (ECF No. 1)

 (Indictment). Mr. Ketchen was charged in Counts One and Three. Id. at 2-5. Count
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 2 of 46             PageID #: 1618



 One alleged that Mr. Ketchen knowingly and intentionally conspired to distribute

 and possess with intent to distribute 3,4-Methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV),

 classified as a controlled substance analogue prior to October 21, 2011, and classified

 as a schedule I controlled substance as of October 21, 2011, all in violation of 21 U.S.C.

 §§ 813, 841(a)(1). Id. at 2-3. Count Three alleged that Mr. Ketchen knowingly leased,

 rented, used and maintained, permanently or temporarily, a residence in Bangor,

 Maine for the purpose of unlawfully distributing and using MDPV, classified as a

 controlled substance analogue prior to October 21, 2011, and classified a schedule I

 controlled substance as of October 21, 2011. Id. at 4-5.

       On August 6, 2013, Mr. Ketchen was arrested, (ECF No. 75), and made his

 initial appearance, entering a plea of not guilty to the charges. (ECF No. 93). On

 May 7, 2014, Mr. Ketchen pleaded guilty to the indictment. Entry (ECF No. 374).

 After Mr. Ketchen and two of his co-defendants raised a question in their sentencing

 memoranda as to how MDPV should be treated for sentencing purposes, on June 11,

 2015, the Court ruled against Mr. Ketchen and two of his co-defendants and

 concluded that MDPV should be considered a controlled substance analogue to

 methcathinone, a schedule I controlled substance.          Order on Treatment of 3,4

 Methylenedioxypyrovalerone Under United States Sentencing Guidelines and Req. for

 Joint Presentence Conference (ECF No. 706).

       On June 30, 2015, Mr. Ketchen moved under Federal Rule of Criminal

 Procedure 11(d)(2)(B) to withdraw his guilty plea to Counts One and Three. Mot. to

 Withdraw Guilty Plea (ECF No. 708) (Def.’s Mot.). On August 31, 2015, Mr. Ketchen

 II.    THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

        A.     Mr. Ketchen’s Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea

        On June 18, 2015, the United States Supreme Court decided McFadden v.

 United States, 135 S. Ct. 2298 (2015), holding that section 841(a)(1) of the Controlled

 Substances Act (CSA), 21 U.S.C. §§ 801-971, “requires the Government to establish

 that the defendant knew he was dealing with ‘a controlled substance,’” and

 specifically that:

        [w]hen the substance is an analogue, that knowledge requirement is met
        if the defendant knew that the substance was controlled under the CSA
        or the [Controlled Substance Analogue Enforcement Act of 1986 (the
        Analogue Act)], even if he did not know its identity. The knowledge
        requirement is also met if the defendant knew the specific features of
        the substance that make it a ‘controlled substance analogue.’

 Id. at 2302 (citing 21 U.S.C. § 802(32)(A)).      Mr. Ketchen asserts, pursuant to

 McFadden, that he should be permitted to withdraw his guilty plea, as: (1) “the

 scienter requirement was not explained to [Mr. Ketchen] in the [Rule 11 proceeding]”;

 (2) “the scienter requirement was not part of the government’s version of the offense”;

 (3) “that a defense exists regarding an element of the offense which was not

 anticipated, nor explained in his plea”; and (4) that McFadden “highlights facts, laws

                                           3
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 4 of 46             PageID #: 1620



 and circumstances not known to the defendant nor explained to the defendant

 regarding his [Rule 11 proceeding].” Id. at 3. Mr. Ketchen concludes that because of

 McFadden there is “a basis for a ‘fair and reasonable reason to request withdrawal of

 his guilty plea,’” and specifically that the Government failed to provide evidence in

 the indictment “that the defendant knew MDPV was [an] ‘analogue’ drug prior to

 October 21, 2011 and that the defendant knew MDPV was a controlled substance

 after October 21, 2011.” Id. at 3-4 (citing F. R. CRIM. P. 11(d)(2)(B)).

       B.     Mr. Ketchen’s Memorandum in Support of his Motion to
              Withdraw Guilty Plea

       Mr. Ketchen acknowledges that the burden of persuasion rests upon the

 defendant for a withdrawal of guilty plea, and lists the relevant factors to consider in

 whether to grant a withdrawal of guilty plea as including “whether the plea was

 voluntary, intelligent and knowing and complied with Rule 11; the force of the

 reasons offered by the defendant; whether there is a serious claim of actual innocence;

 the timing of the motion; and any countervailing prejudice to the government if the

 defendant is allowed to withdraw his plea.” Def.’s Mem. at 2 (citing United States v.

 Castro-Gomez, 233 F.3d 684, 687 (1st Cir. 2000)).

       Mr. Ketchen says that knowledge that a substance is controlled under “the

 Analogue Act is a necessary element of Count 1 and Count 3 of the indictment,” and

 that the indictment “did not indicate that [he] knew that the substance was a

 controlled substance analogue prior to October 21, 2011.” Id. at 3-4. Moreover, he

 argues that the mere knowledge of the “identity of the substance” is not sufficient to

 satisfy the requisite mens rea and that in addition he needed to know the substance

                                            4
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 5 of 46             PageID #: 1621



 was controlled. Id. at 5. Mr. Ketchen asserts that the record from his Rule 11

 proceeding illustrates that his plea was not “voluntary, intelligent or knowing,” as

 the Government “failed to distinguish the two sets of applicable laws and the

 ‘knowingly’ requirement of possession and distribution under the Analogue Act” and

 “[did] not indicate that the [he] knew that MDPV was a controlled substance analogue

 during acts of possession and distribution prior to October 21, 2011.”           Id. at 6

 (emphasis in original).

       Regarding the other factors to be weighed when considering a withdrawal of a

 guilty plea, Mr. Ketchen says that the amount of time between a guilty plea and the

 request to withdraw the plea is a “relevant temporal gap” measured from the date of

 “discovery of new information occurs” to the withdrawal of guilty plea. Id. at 7

 (quoting United States v. Gonzalez, 202 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 2000)). Mr. Ketchen

 notes that he filed his motion only days after the issuance of McFadden. Id. He also

 asserts that there is evidence of his innocence “regarding this very narrow issue,”

 noting that in his statement of acceptance of responsibility he maintained that he

 “was told that they were synthetic research chemicals that were legal . . . that you

 could get it at the head shop and at truck stops. That you could get it off the internet.”

 Id. Finally, Mr. Ketchen says that he “does not believe that there is any substantial

 prejudice to the government in this case.” Id. at 8.

       C.     The Government’s Objection to Mr. Ketchen’s Motion

         Addressing the “voluntarily, knowingly, intelligently” analysis for a

 withdrawal of guilty plea, the Government asserts that Rule 11 “has a predominantly



                                             5
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 6 of 46           PageID #: 1622



 prophylactic purpose,” and that the “main thrust of the rule is to ensure that a

 defendant who pleads guilty does so with full comprehension of the specific attributes

 of the charge and the possible consequences of the plea.” Gov’t’s Opp’n at 10 (citing

 United States v. McDonald, 121 F.3d 7, 11 (1st Cir. 1997)). The Government argues

 that the transcript of Mr. Ketchen’s Rule 11 proceeding reflects that he was advised

 of “the charges, the penalties that could be imposed, and the rights he was giving up

 by pleading guilty,” that Mr. Ketchen does not “seriously dispute this,” and that he

 only makes “a nuanced argument concerning his understanding of the mens rea

 element of the offenses” and at no point argues that the plea was involuntary. Id. at

 10 n.2.

       Next, the Government identifies two reasons put forth by Mr. Ketchen to

 withdraw his guilty plea: (1) that the Government “cannot prove beyond a reasonable

 doubt that prior to October 21, 2011 he knew he was possessing or distributing a

 substance regulated under the Analogue Act,” and (2) that the Court “did not explain

 the mens rea element of the two offences,” and particularly the “mens rea element in

 offenses involving controlled substance analogues like MDPV as recently explained

 in McFadden.” Id. at 10 (emphasis in original). The Government contends that the

 strength of the reasons offered for the withdrawal of guilty plea is “lacking.” Id.

       First, the Government argues that the Court adequately advised Mr. Ketchen

 of the mens rea element under Rule 11. Id. Citing United States v. Jones, 778 F.3d

 375, 382 (1st Cir. 2015), the Government asserts that a guilty plea under Rule 11

 does not require “a fixed catechism” or a set of “magic words,” but only that a district



                                            6
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 7 of 46            PageID #: 1623



 court touch all of the “appropriate bases” and its colloquy be assessed “in light of ‘the

 attributes of the particular defendant, the nature of the specific offense, and the

 complexity of the attendant circumstances.’” Gov’t’s Opp’n at 10-11 (quoting Jones,

 778 F.3d at 382). As such, the Government asserts that McFadden does not create a

 new mens rea requirement for controlled substance analogue offenses, but rather

 “confirmed pre-existing case law establishing a mens rea requirement in controlled

 substance offenses, confirmed that requirement must be met by the Government in

 cases involving substances that were controlled either by operation of the drug

 schedules or by operation of the Analogue Act, and explained how the Government

 could circumstantially prove the mens rea requirement in an analogue case.” Id. at

 11. The Government submits that the Court’s summary of the charges were sufficient

 under this rubric, as the Court advised Mr. Ketchen that he was charged “with

 knowingly and intentionally conspiring to distribute a controlled substance,” and the

 Court was not required to explain “the intricacies regarding how MDPV was

 controlled at different times.” Id. at 11-12 (emphasis in original).

       Second, the Government asserts that the law is clear that a crime may be

 charged in the conjunctive. Id. at 12-13 (citing United States v. Garcia-Torres, 341

 F.3d 61, 66 (1st Cir. 2003)).       The Government explains that the concept of

 “conjunctive” stands for “where an indictment charges in the conjunctive several

 means of violating a statute, a conviction may be obtained on proof of only one of the

 means.” Id. at 13 (quoting Garcia-Torres, 341 F.3d at 66-67)). Thus, the Government

 contends that because Count One charges Mr. Ketchen “with conspiring to distribute



                                            7
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 8 of 46         PageID #: 1624



 and possess with the intent to distribute the controlled (analogue) substance MDPV

 and the controlled (Schedule I) substance MDPV . . . Guilt of his commission of this

 offense – by plea or by trial – could be established by proving his knowing

 participation in the conspiracy involved one or the other.” Id. at 14 (citing Garcia-

 Torres, 341 F.3d at 66-67). Similarly, for Count Three, “[g]uilt of his commission of

 this offense (by plea or by trial) could be established by proof he knowingly leased,

 rented, used or maintained the residence for distributing or using the analogue

 controlled substance MDPV or the Schedule I controlled substance MDPV.” Id. The

 Government concludes that Mr. Ketchen’s guilty pleas are not affected by the

 McFadden decision, as:

       [e]ven assuming arguendo that . . . the Government could not prove his
       guilt as to conduct that occurred prior to October 21, 2011, that would
       not earn him an acquittal at trial or warrant a withdrawal of his guilty
       plea. He does not contend that he misunderstood the mens rea element
       as it relates to offenses involving a Schedule I drug like MDPV.

 Id. at 14-15.

       Regarding the timing of the motion, the Government highlights that Mr.

 Ketchen was indicted on July 17, 2013, pleaded guilty to Counts One and Three on

 May 7, 2014, and on July 30, 2015 – fourteen months after he pleaded guilty – moved

 to withdraw his guilty plea. Id. at 15. Noting this lapse in time, the Government

 argues that the longer a request is delayed, the more potency the motion must have

 in order to gain favorable consideration and the more the Court should disfavor the

 motion. Id. at 15 (citing United States v. González-Vázquez, 34 F.3d 19, 23 (1st Cir.

 1994)). The Government argues that McFadden did not create a new element of an



                                          8
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 9 of 46           PageID #: 1625



 offense, and when considering the lack of force to Mr. Ketchen’s assertion of

 innocence, the fourteen-month delay in making his motion to withdraw guilty plea

 undermines his request. Id. at 16.

       The Government points out that Mr. Ketchen is only claiming his innocence of

 part of the crimes charged in Counts One and Three of the indictment, and that the

 totality of the circumstances demonstrate that there is little force to his assertion of

 innocence. Id. at 16. The Government notes that Mr. Ketchen admitted to the

 prosecution version of the offense at his Rule 11 proceeding, and thus agreed that he

 knowingly and intentionally participated in a conspiracy to distribute MDPV,

 satisfying the requirements of McFadden.           Id. at 16-17.     Additionally, the

 Government says that the PSR reveals “overwhelming” evidence of Mr. Ketchen’s

 participation in the drug conspiracy. Id. at 17-18. The Government provides other

 examples that the Court should consider when assessing Mr. Ketchen’s assertion of

 innocence, including: (1) “seventeen of [Mr. Ketchen’s] co-conspirators have admitted

 to conspiring with [Mr. Ketchen]” and none of them has “sought to withdraw or vacate

 their guilty pleas”; (2) “[n]umerous cooperating defendants and witnesses testified

 before the grand jury, thousands of pages of business records were collected, and law

 enforcement seized MDPV from [Mr. Ketchen] and his co-conspirators”; and (3) “[t]he

 Court listened to every co-conspirator’s allocution and read their statements

 accepting responsibility,” giving the Court “special insight into this case” which it

 should draw on “when considering the force of [Mr. Ketchen’s] claim that he is

 innocent.” Id. at 18-19.



                                            9
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 10 of 46         PageID #: 1626



       Finally, the Government contends that Mr. Ketchen has failed to prove that

 the Government would suffer no prejudice if his motion to withdraw guilty plea was

 granted. Id. at 19. The Government highlights that the investigation into Mr.

 Ketchen’s conduct began over four years ago, he was indicted over two years ago, and

 that “[w]ith the passage of time memories fade and witnesses relocate” and “[p]roving

 a case beyond a reasonable doubt” after this lapse in time would be difficult. Id.

 Additionally, the Government also observes that since his guilty plea all of his co-

 conspirators have been sentenced and it may prove difficult to obtain their testimony.

 Id. at 19-20.

       D.        Mr. Ketchen’s Response to the Government’s Objection

       Mr. Ketchen responds by arguing that “[n]either the indictment nor the Rule

 11 Proceeding included the necessary scienter element of MDPV being a controlled

 substance analogue,” and because of this his plea “could not have been made

 voluntarily, intelligently, or knowingly” and that he can show evidence of actual

 innocence under the Analogue Act.” Def.’s Reply at 2.

       Mr. Ketchen renews his argument that the “indictment left out the necessary

 mens rea element that he knew he was possessing and or distributing a substance in

 violation of the Analogue Act,” and specifically that the “indictment never specified

 that [he] knew that the substance was a controlled substance analogue prior to

 October 21, 2011” and was thus insufficient under McFadden. Id. at 3 (emphasis in

 original). Regarding the Rule 11 proceeding, he argues that the Court “surely did not

 touch on all the ‘appropriate bases’ when it left out the scienter element of the



                                          10
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 11 of 46            PageID #: 1627



 offense,” which is grounds for withdrawal of his plea of guilty, as “[d]ue process

 requires that a defendant be apprised of the nature of the charges, including the

 element of intent.” Id. at 5 (quoting United States v. Bigman, 906 F.2d 392, 394 (9th

 Cir. 1990)). Mr. Ketchen asserts that though “[t]he Court did advise [him] that he

 was charged with knowingly and intentionally conspiring with others and that he

 knowingly used a property to do this . . . the Court omitted if [he] knew that MDPV

 was a controlled substance analogue during the acts of possession and distribution

 prior to October 11, 2011.” Id. at 6 (emphasis in original).

        Mr. Ketchen concludes his reply brief by renewing his arguments regarding

 the timing of the motion, evidence of actual innocence, and prejudice to the

 Government. Id. at 7.

 III.   FACTUAL, STATUTORY, AND CASELAW BACKGROUND

        A.    The Indictment

        On July 17, 2013, the grand jury charged Mr. Ketchen with violating federal

 drug trafficking laws; Count One of the indictment reads:

        Beginning on a date unknown, but no later than April 1, 2011 and
        continuing until a date unknown, but no earlier than December 31,
        2011, in the District of Maine and elsewhere, defendants . . . knowingly
        and intentionally conspired with one another and with persons known
        and unknown to commit offenses against the United States, namely
        distribution and possession with intent to distribute: (1) prior to October
        21, 2011, a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of
        MDPV, a controlled substance analogue as defined in Title 21, United
        States Code, Section 802(32), with intent for human consumption as
        provided in Title 21, United States Code, Section 813; and (2) from
        October 21, 2011 until a date unknown, but no earlier than December
        31, 2011, a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of
        MDPV, a Schedule I controlled substance (by Final Order of DEA, 76



                                            11
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 12 of 46            PageID #: 1628



        Fed. Reg. 65371), all in violation of Title 21, United States Code, Section
        846, 841(a)(1), and 813.

 Indictment at 3. Count Three states:

        Beginning on a date unknown, but not later than April 1, 2011, and
        continuing until December 31, 2011, in the District of Maine,
        defendant[] . . . ALAN J. KETCHEN, a/k/a "AJ", "Hobbes" . . .
        knowingly leased, rented, used and maintained, permanently or
        temporarily, a residence located at 10 Blackstone Street in Bangor,
        Maine, for the purpose of unlawfully distributing and using (1) prior to
        October 21, 2011, a mixture or substance containing a detectable
        amount of MDPV, a controlled substance analogue as defined in Title
        21, United States Code, Section 802(32), with intent for human
        consumption as provided in Title 21, United States Code, Section 813;
        and (2) from October 21, 2011 until a date unknown, but no earlier than
        December 31, 2011, a mixture or substance containing a detectable
        amount of MDPV, a Schedule I controlled substance (by Final Order of
        DEA, 76 Fed. Reg. 65371), and did aid and abet such conduct, in
        violation of Title 21, United States Code, Sections 856(a)(1) and 813 and
        Title 18, United States Code, Section 2.

 Id. at 4-5 (bold in original).

        B.     The Rule 11 Proceeding

        On May 7, 2014, Mr. Ketchen pleaded guilty to Counts One and Three of the

 Indictment. See Minute Entry (ECF No. 374); Transcript of Rule 11 Proceeding (ECF

 No. 710) (Tr.). During the proceeding the Court found Mr. Ketchen to be competent,

 Tr. 4:6-6:15, allowed him to tender a plea of guilty, id. 7:6-7:20, and confirmed that

 he was pleading guilty to the charges because he was “actually guilty of each of those

 crimes and for no other reason.” Id. 8:1-4. His counsel expressed satisfaction that Mr.

 Ketchen was pleading guilty because he was actually guilty. Id. 8:6-9. Additionally,

 Mr. Ketchen confirmed that he had received a copy of the indictment, that he had

 enough time to discuss the charges with his attorney, and that his attorney had



                                            12
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 13 of 46          PageID #: 1629



 explained the elements and the nature of the offenses charged, and the penalties that

 could be imposed. Id. 8:10-22. Mr. Ketchen’s counsel expressed that he was satisfied

 that the Defendant understood the charges and the penalties that could be imposed,

 id. 8:22-25, and the Court reviewed the charges and confirmed that the Mr. Ketchen

 understood them:

       THE COURT: Count 1 alleges that beginning on a date unknown, but
       no later than April 1, 2011, and continuing until a date unknown, but
       no earlier than December 31, 2011, in the District of Maine, which
       means the state of Maine, you and a number of other individuals
       knowingly and intentionally conspired with one another to commit an
       offense against the United States, namely, the distribution of MDPV, a
       controlled substance. Do you understand the charge set forth in Count
       1 of the indictment?

       MR. KETCHEN: Yes.

       THE COURT: Now, Count 3 of the indictment alleges that beginning on
       a date unknown, but no later than April 1, 2011, and continuing until

       Between approximately April 1, 2011 and December 31, 2011, in
       Penobscot County, Maine and elsewhere, there existed a conspiracy to
       possess with intent to distribute and distribute (1) prior to October 21,
       2011, a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of MDPV,
       a controlled substance analogue as defined in Title 21, United States
       Code, Section 802 (32), with intent for human consumption as provided
       in Title 21, United States Code, Section 813; and (2) from October 21,
       2011 until a date unknown, but no earlier than December 31, 2011, a
       mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of MDPV, a
       Schedule I controlled substance. During its existence, the defendant
       knowingly and intentionally joined and participated in the conspiracy.

       During the same period of time, the defendant also knowingly leased,
       rented, used and maintained, permanently or temporarily, a residence
       located at XX Blackstone Street in Bangor, Maine (“the Blackstone
       Residence”), for the purpose of unlawfully distributing and using (1)
       prior to October 21, 2011, a mixture or substance containing a detectable
       amount of MDPV, a controlled substance analogue as defined in Title
       21, United States Code, Section 802 (32), with intent for human
       consumption as provided in Title 21, United States Code, Section 813;
       and (2) from October 21, 2011 until a date unknown, but no earlier than
       December 31, 2011, a mixture or substance containing a detectable
       amount of MDPV, a Schedule I controlled substance (by Final Order of
       DEA, 76 Fed. Reg. 65371.

       During his involvement in the conspiracy, the defendant regularly
       associated with other members of the conspiracy at the Blackstone
       Residence and elsewhere, including co-defendant Ryan Ellis, for the
       purpose of distributing and facilitating the distribution of MDPV and
       using the same. The defendant packaged MDPV at the Blackstone
       Residence and distributed it to other members of the conspiracy who
       were selling the drug. The defendant collected proceeds from the sale of
       the drug. The defendant also traded or otherwise distributed MDPV to
       other members of the conspiracy. The defendant communicated by
       cellular telephone and met directly with other members of the
       conspiracy to coordinate MDPV transactions. On November 10, 2011,
       law enforcement conducted a bail search at the Blackstone Residence
       and subsequently executed a search warrant at that location. As a
       result, law enforcement seized a large quantity of MDPV and other
       controlled substances, cash, drug records, and drug paraphernalia. The
       defendant was arrested following the search.

 Gov’t’s Version of the Offense at 1-2 (ECF No. 371) (Prosecution Version).       Mr.

 Ketchen’s counsel confirmed that he had reviewed the prosecution version, that he

 was convinced the Government’s version of the offense could be proved, and that a

 properly instructed jury could determine beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Ketchen

 was guilty of each of the crimes to which he pleaded guilty. Tr. 15:10-16-7. Mr.

 Ketchen confirmed that he had carefully reviewed the prosecution version,

 understood it, had no disagreements with it, and that it was true to his own personal

 knowledge. Id. 16:8-17:10. Upon final inquiry, the Court accepted Mr. Ketchen’s

 guilty plea under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11. Id. 20:22-21:9.

       C.     The Presentence Investigation

       The final Presentence Report (PSR) described Mr. Ketchen’s alleged unlawful

 conduct in relevant part:

       This case was investigated by the United States Department of Justice
       Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and other law enforcement
       agencies and commenced in early 2011. Authorities learned of a drug
       trafficking organization, involving 3,4- Methylenedioxypyrovalerone
       (MDPV), otherwise known as the synthetic drug “bath salts.” In general,
       the defendant was one of the main dealers of MDPV in this conspiracy
       who was also abusing the drug. The defendant obtained large quantities
       of MDPV from various sources, including his primary source of supply;
       Ryan Ellis. Ketchen, with the assistance of others, would process and
       re-package the large quantities of MDPV and supply distribution size
       quantities of MDPV to other members of the conspiracy for resale.

       In 2011, the DEA obtained information from a source of information,
       (herein SI-2) regarding the defendant’s involvement in the bath salts
       conspiracy. According to SI-2, he was introduced to Ketchen in June or
       July of 2011, at 10 Blackstone Street, Bangor, Maine, where Ketchen
       was residing. Ketchen and co-conspirator Jamie Lewis introduced SI-2
       to bath salts and he began obtaining bath salts from the defendant and
       Lewis on a regular basis. SI-2 began distributing bath salts for Ketchen
       and Lewis to support his own habit. SI-2 would purchase 10 grams of

                                          15
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 16 of 46          PageID #: 1632



       bath salts for $800 from Ketchen. Eventually, Ketchen introduced SI-2
       to his source of supply, Ryan Ellis, and SI-2 began dealing directly with
       Ellis. When SI-2 began working for Ellis, he stopped dealing for Ketchen
       and Ellis paid Ketchen a $3,000 drug debt that SI-2 had “racked up.”
       Although Ellis admitted he sold bath salts anywhere between $0 and
       $50, the typical resale price in this conspiracy was $100 per gram of bath
       salts. Therefore, following the rule of lenity, the Probation Office will
       convert the $3,000 drug debt into drug quantity ($3,000 divided by $100,
       equals 30 grams of bath salts). SI-2 advised Ketchen also sold Suboxone,
       Xanax, Klonopin, and Ecstasy. On one occasion, SI-2 went with a co-
       conspirator to pick up between 500 and 1,000 Xanax from Ketchen.
       Following the rule of lenity, the Probation Office will hold the defendant
       accountable for 500 Xanax 1 mg pills; the typical pill weight the
       defendant sold. SI-2 walked in on a deal between Ketchen and Ellis,
       where Ketchen gave Ellis approximately $5,000 for a large vacuum
       sealed bag of bath salts. Although it is likely the defendant purchased
       the bulk quantity of bath salts for reduced price; following the rule of
       lenity, the Probation Office will use the aforementioned method for
       converting cash into drug quantity ($5,000 divided by $100, equals 50
       grams of bath salts). SI-2 further advised he witnessed SI-4 purchase 10
       to 20 grams of bath salts from Ketchen on more than 50 occasions (10
       multiplied by 50, equals 500 grams of bath salts). . . . SI-8 reported
       Bryden took him to the Blackstone residence and fronted Ketchen one
       ounce (28.3495 grams) of bath salts. To avoid double counting, the
       Probation Office did not hold the defendant accountable for the one
       ounce of bath salts fronted to him. SI-16 reported he would purchase
       bath salts from the defendant for $30 per gram. SI-16 would purchase
       10 grams of bath salts at a time, for an unknown period of time. . . . .

       Grand Jury testimony and information obtained from confidential
       sources, corroborates the following information. Ketchen and Ryan Ellis
       were on the same level and considered to be the “biggest dealers of bath
       salts.” In fact, Ellis advised he had four “main people,” naming Ketchen
       as one of them. Ketchen resided at the aforementioned residence on
       Blackstone Street in Bangor, Maine, and sold bath salts out of the
       residence. Ketchen would receive shipments of bath salts at his
       residence on behalf of Ellis. The defendant would order prescription pills
       online and receive the shipments at his residence, as well as other
       locations. With the assistance of others, Ketchen would process and re-
       package the large quantities of bath salts and supply distribution size
       quantities to other members of the conspiracy. The defendant’s primary
       purpose of his residence was to store, package and sell drugs. The
       defendant sold distribution quantities of bath salts to various customers
       throughout the State of Maine; primarily out of his residence. Other co-

                                          16
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 17 of 46          PageID #: 1633



       conspirators would make deliveries on behalf of Ketchen. The defendant
       would front his customers, with the expectation they would pay him
       back, or he would also take cash or stolen property for payment for bath
       salts.

       On November 3, 2011, co-defendant April Kane was arrested by Veazie
       Police Department, Veazie, Maine, for Violating Conditions of Bail and
       Unlawful Trafficking in Bath Salts. A search of the vehicle revealed
       various unlawful items, including, but not limited to 180.70 grams of
       bath salts concealed inside of a speaker in the trunk. The bath salts were
       placed inside of a subwoofer, which was then placed inside Kane’s
       vehicle. SI-1 reported the bath salts Kane was caught with were
       supplied by Ketchen, but really belonged to Ellis.

       On November 4, 2011, Shayne Ellis was arrested by Brewer Police
       Department for Aggravated Trafficking of Scheduled Drugs; Unlawful
       Possession of Hydrocodone; and Unlawful Possession of Oxycodone. A
       search of Shayne Ellis yielded various items. Other than the 32
       Suboxone pills and 7 Suboxone strips he possessed, SI-1 indicated the
       drugs located on Shayne Ellis were obtained from Ketchen. . . . .

       On November 10, 2011, law enforcement conducted a bail search at the
       defendant’s residence located on Blackstone Street in Bangor, Maine. A
       search of Ketchen’s person revealed a Crown Royal bag containing
       $1,335 in cash. A search of the defendant’s bedroom revealed cellular
       telephones; Tupperware containers containing a confirmed total amount
       of 122.5 grams of bath salts; digital scales; packaging material
       consistent with bath salts distribution; various drug paraphernalia;
       notebooks that contained what appeared to be drug records, as well as
       websites and lists of chemical names; laptop computers; and a safe.
       Ketchen denied ownership of the safe, or the combination to get into the
       safe. The safe was subsequently seized to allow agents to apply for a
       search warrant. On November 15, 2011, the search warrant was
       authorized for the safe seized from Ketchen’s bedroom. Execution of the
       search warrant revealed various items including, but not limited to:
       documents and a medical wrist bracelet bearing the name “Alan
       Ketchen;” a video recorder; an iPod Touch; 7 Oxycodone pills 5 mg (35
       mg); 1 Oxycodone pill 15 mg; 7 Clonazepam (Klonopin) pills 0.5 mg; 40
       Valium (Diazepam) pills 10 mg; 6 Xanax pills 1 mg; 15 Percocet
       (Oxycodone) pills 10 mg (150 mg); $10,127 in cash; 988 grams of bath
       salts. Some of the drugs were contained in bulk in plastic containers,
       while some had been prepackaged in plastic bags bearing logos identical
       to bags found in Ketchen’s bedroom on November 10, 2011. . . .

       In February 2012, SI-2 provided the DEA with information regarding
       the contents of the notebooks seized from the defendant’s residence on
       November 10, 2012, which contained buyer’s drug debts. SI-2 identified
       the names listed next to the dollar amounts, which consisted of owed
       drug debts. As previously mentioned, Ryan Ellis paid Ketchen for SI-2’s
       $3,000 drug debt balance; therefore, the Probation Office did not
       consider the debts listed for SI-2, as they have been previously
       calculated into the drug quantity. . . .

       It was later discovered that agents did not recover an additional
       quantity of bath salts that were located in Ketchen’s residence. The
       defendant called SI-1 from the Penobscot County Jail and advised him
       of the missed drugs still at his apartment. Co-conspirators Daniel Hines
       and Gina Nelson agreed to sell the unrecovered drugs. The drugs were
       then transported to the Riverview Motel in Bangor for a short time,
       before being transported to a storage unit in Old Town, Maine, rented
       by Daniel Hines. On November 21, 2011, the remaining unrecovered
       drugs were transported from the storage unit back to the room at
       Riverview Motel. On November 22, 2011, the co-conspirators moved the
       drugs to a local hotel in Brewer, Maine. On November 22, 2011, law
       enforcement conducted surveillance on the local hotel, as the renter of
       the hotel room was on bail conditions, including a search condition
       without probable cause. Law enforcement observed a male, later
       identified as Ryan Ellis, exit the hotel room under surveillance. Ellis
       placed a bag in the trunk of a vehicle and drove off. The vehicle operated
       by Ellis was subsequently stopped by Brewer Police Department. A
       search of the vehicle revealed, among many other things, 313.1 grams of
       bath salts in vacuum sealed bags. The bags of bath salts were located in
       the backpack that Ellis was observed placing in the trunk, prior to
       leaving the hotel room. Law enforcement subsequently conducted a bail
       search at the hotel room and located various drug-related items,
       including 85.4 grams of bath salts; 0.58 ounces of marijuana; $3,469
       cash (34.69 grams of bath salts); 197 Xanax; 44 Klonopin (Clonazepam);
       7 Suboxone; 6 Methadone; 7 Vicodin (hydrocodone bitartrate and
       acetaminophen); 17 Oxycodone; and 1 OxyContin (Oxycodone).
       Subsequent to the arrest, SI-1 reported Ellis arrived at the hotel room
       in Brewer to pick up the (unrecovered) bath salts. SI-1 indicated Ellis
       took the drugs, but left some behind at the hotel room; a smaller portion
       of approximately one ounce as a “gift” and a larger portion to give to a
       co-conspirator for distribution. . . .

       In 2011, the DEA obtained information from SI-3 who indicated he
       would purchase 1,000 or more Xanax pills and 45-50 Suboxone from
       Ketchen at one time. SI-1 indicated he purchased the following drugs

                                          18
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 19 of 46                         PageID #: 1635



         from Ketchen: approximately 333 Xanax on six or eight occasions (1,998
         Xanax); 20 to 30 Oxycodone 5 mg pills; and 20 to 40 Klonopin. SI-1
         reported he had seen Ketchen with as many as 1000 Xanax pills at one
         time. SI-34 advised that Ketchen was one of his main suppliers. . . .

         In 2013, SI-11 informed the DEA that from May to November of 2011,
         he was getting one ounce of bath salts one-to-two times per week. . . . SI-
         14 reported that every time he was at Ketchen’s residence, he saw a
         huge “pile” of bath salts, estimated to be approximately 40 grams. On
         four occasions, SI-14 witnessed Ellis drop a “brick” of bath salts off at
         the defendant’s residence. Each brick was reported to be 12 inches in
         length. . . .

 PSR ¶¶ 4-13.1 Mr. Ketchen also offered a written acknowledgment of his guilt and

 an apology for his actions for which he pleaded guilty:

         My name is Alan Ketchen and I am 41 years old. I have a lengthy drug
         history. I have been able to work through it in the past and still function
         for quite some time but not without consequence. With regard to the
         instant criminal offense, I am so sorry for the harm I have done to
         myself, my girlfriend Gina Nelson, my baby, my family, the community,
         other drug addicted people involved, public safety and the court. Back
         in December 2010 I was turned onto a drug called bath salts “MDPV” by
         a longtime drug addict so called friend Jamie Lewis. It was a rave drug.
         People do certain drugs to stay up all night and go partying all night,
         dance, have sex or whatever. Looking back the addiction was horrible. I
         started using it and increased the use to astronomical proportion.
         Eventually, in March or April 2011 I was introduced to Jamie Lewis’
         dealer Ryan Ellis who would sell some to me so that I could use more
         and sell to other people. I was told that they were synthetic research
         chemicals that were legal by Jamie and Ryan. This drug was supposed
         to be so legal that you could get it at the head shop and at the truck
         stops. That they could get it off the internet. That’s what Jamie and
         Ryan told me. From that point on, I could not seem to stop using the
         drugs and increased my use and my sale. At some point I became aware
         that I was selling and using an illegal drug. I was out of control. Ryan
         would provide me with more and more drugs and more and more money
         and I would just use more and more. I started selling MDPV out of my
         apartment and was clear that the laws changed or at least my perception
         of the law changed. I was not just selling a legal synthetic chemical, I

 1       Mr. Ketchen originally made factual objections to portions of paragraphs 5, 8, 10, 11, and 13
 of the PSR but later withdrew those objections. Gov’t’s Opp’n at 4 n.2; Gov’t’s Mem. in Aid of Sentencing
 at 9 (ECF No. 595).

       was selling an illegal drug and using an illegal substance. I was being
       supplied an illegal drug, selling an illegal drug and getting enough to
       use in return. That was my reward because I was in the wrong state of
       mind not thinking of the consequences but being a super drug addict.
       Instead of making much money from my sales, I was increasing my drug
       usage and buying paraphernalia. I was sending all or most of the money
       back to Ryan, day to day it became a real happening for me to use. A
       real social event every day, but what a false reality. On November 10,
       2011, when police came to my house, I was as high as a drug addict could
       be and had several hundred grams of drugs and several dollars of money
       to give back to Ryan, my drug dealer. At that time, I was arrested and I
       stopped using and selling MDPV. Now I have to serve my time in federal
       prison. I am sorry for those activities and once again apologize to the
       court. I have been in jail from November 10, 2011 to January 18, 2012.
       Several months later, August 6, 2013, I was arrested on these federal
       charges for those acts and admit the violation and place myself on the
       mercy of the court.

       D.     The Statutory Backdrop

              1.     Chapter 13 of Title 21; Drug Abuse Prevention and
                     Control

       In the indictment, the Government charged Mr. Ketchen with violating 21

 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), which makes illegal the knowing or intentional distribution or

 possession with the intent to distribute certain controlled substances.           More

 specifically, the Government charged Mr. Ketchen with violating § 841(b)(1)(C), a

 provision that refers to “controlled substances in schedule I or II.” See 21 U.S.C. §

 841(b)(1)(C). Similarly, in § 802(6), the law defines “controlled substance” to mean “a

 drug or other substance, or immediate precursor, included in schedule I, II, III, IV, or

 V of part B of this subchapter.” 21 U.S.C. § 802(6). The law grants the Attorney

 General of the United States the authority to add or remove drugs from a schedule

 after opportunity for a hearing. 21 U.S.C. § 811(a).

       Effective October 21, 2011, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement

 Administration listed MDPV as a schedule I controlled substance:

       SUMMARY: The Administrator of the Drug Enforcement
       Administration (DEA) is issuing this final order to temporarily schedule
       three synthetic cathinones under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA)
       pursuant to the temporary scheduling provisions of 21 U.S.C. 811(h).
       The substances are 4-methyl-N-methylcathinone (mephedrone), 3,4-
       methylenedioxy-N-methylcathinone           (methylone),     and        3,4-
       methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV). This action is based on a finding
       by the Administrator that the placement of these synthetic cathinones
       and their salts, isomers, and salts of isomers into Schedule I of the CSA
       is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. As a
       result of this order, the full effect of the CSA and its implementing
       regulations including criminal, civil and administrative penalties,
       sanctions and regulatory controls of Schedule I substances will be
       imposed on the manufacture, distribution, possession, importation, and

 “make illegal the production of designer drugs and other chemical variants of listed

 controlled substances that otherwise would escape the reach of the drug laws”). The

 Analogue Act provides:

        A controlled substance analogue shall, to the extent intended for human
        consumption, be treated, for the purposes of any Federal law as a
        controlled substance in schedule I.

 21 U.S.C. § 813. Except as provided in subparagraph (C) of § 802(32),2 the term

 “controlled substance analogue” means a substance:

        (i) the chemical structure of which is substantially similar to the
        chemical structure of a controlled substance in schedule I or II;
        (ii) which has a stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the
        central nervous system that is substantially similar to or greater than
        the stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central
        nervous system of a controlled substance in schedule I or II; or
        (iii) with respect to a particular person, which such person represents or
        intends to have a stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the
        central nervous system that is substantially similar to or greater than
        the stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central
        nervous system of a controlled substance in schedule I or II.
 21 U.S.C. § 802(32)(A).       These provisions require the Government prove three

 elements: “(1) substantial chemical similarity between the analogue and the

 controlled substance (the chemical structure element)”; “(2) substantially similar

 actual, intended, or represented physiological effects on the central nervous system

 (the pharmacological similarity element)”; and, “(3) intent that the substance be

 consumed by humans (the human consumption element).” Ketchen, 2015 U.S. Dist.

 U.S.C. § 802(32)(C).

 LEXIS 75689, at *18 (citing 21 U.S.C. § 813; McFadden, 753 F.3d at 436; United

 States v. Klecker, 348 F.3d 69, 71 (4th Cir. 2003)).

       E.     McFadden and its Progeny

       In McFadden, the Supreme Court held that in order to prove an Analogue Act

 violation the government must establish that the defendant knew he was dealing

 with a “controlled substance.” 135 S. Ct. at 2302. The McFadden Court noted that

 “[t]he Analogue Act requires a controlled substance analogue, if intended for human

 consumption, to be treated ‘as a controlled substance in schedule I’ for purposes of

 federal law.” Id. at 2303 (quoting 21 U.S.C. § 813). Accordingly, the Supreme Court

 turned to the mens rea requirement of the CSA, which makes it “unlawful for any

 person knowingly or intentionally . . . to manufacture, distribute, dispense, or possess

 with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance.” Id.

 (quoting 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1)).     Thus, as the Analogue Act requires controlled

 substance analogues to be treated as controlled substances, the Supreme Court

 concluded that pursuant to § 841, “the Government must prove that a defendant

 knew that the substance with which he was dealing was ‘a controlled substance,’ even

 in prosecutions involving an analogue.” Id. at 2305.

       As for the knowledge requirement, the McFadden Court clarified that under §

 841 a defendant need know “only that the substance he is dealing with is some

 unspecified substance listed on the federal drug schedules.”        Id. at 2304.    The

 Supreme Court held that this can be established in two ways. First, knowledge “can

 be established by evidence that a defendant knew that the substance with which he



                                            23
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 24 of 46          PageID #: 1640



 was dealing is some controlled substance—that is, one actually listed on the federal

 drug schedules or treated as such by operation of the Analogue Act—regardless of

 whether he knew the particular identity of the substance.” Id. at 2305. Second,

 knowledge can be established “by evidence that the defendant knew the specific

 analogue he was dealing with, even if he did not know its legal status as an analogue.”

 Id. To establish knowledge under this second approach, the government must show

 that the defendant knew that the substance: (1) has a chemical structure

 “substantially similar to the chemical structure of a controlled substance in schedule

 I or II”; (2) has a “‘stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central

 nervous system that is substantially similar to or greater than’ the effect of a

 controlled substance in schedule I or II”; and (3) that the defendant “represented or

 intended the substance to have that effect with respect to a particular person.” Id.

 (quoting § 802(32)(A)); see also Section III(D)(2), supra. The Supreme Court

 underscored that:

       [a] defendant who possesses a substance with knowledge of those
       features knows all of the facts that make his conduct illegal, just as a
       defendant who knows he possesses heroin knows all of the facts that
       make his conduct illegal. A defendant need not know of the existence of
       the Analogue Act to know that he was dealing with ‘a controlled
       substance.’

 Id.

       Additionally, the Supreme Court noted that “as with most mens rea

 requirements, the Government can prove the requisite mental state through either

 direct evidence or circumstantial evidence,” and that “[d]irect evidence could include,

 for example, past arrests that put a defendant on notice of the controlled status of a

                                           24
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 25 of 46            PageID #: 1641



 substance,” while “[c]ircumstantial evidence could include, for example, a defendant's

 concealment of his activities, evasive behavior with respect to law enforcement,

 knowledge that a particular substance produces a ‘high’ similar to that produced by

 controlled substances, and knowledge that a particular substance is subject to seizure

 at customs.”      Id. at 2304 n.1 (citations omitted).      The Court clarified that

 circumstantial evidence can be used to show that a defendant knew that a substance

 was controlled under the CSA or by operation of the Analogue Act. Id. at 2306 n.3.

       The First Circuit has yet to address McFadden and its mens rea requirements.

 The Eighth Circuit has done so twice. See United States v. Carlson, 810 F.3d 544 (8th

 Cir. 2016); United States v. Ramos, Nos. 15–1592, 15–1602, 2016 WL 497167 (8th Cir.

 Feb. 23, 2016).    In Carlson, the Eighth Circuit upheld the district court’s jury

 instructions regarding the second way to establish knowledge under McFadden (e.g.,

 by evidence that the defendant knew the specific analogue he was dealing with, even

 if he did not know its legal status as an analogue). 810 F.3d at 552. Specifically, the

 district court instructed the jury that if “the government has proved beyond a

 reasonable doubt that the defendant knew facts that satisfy part 2 of the test . . .

 [similar nervous system effects], that is evidence from which you may, but are not

 required to, find or infer that the defendant knew facts that satisfy part 1 of the test

 . . . [similar chemical structure].” Id. at 551. The Carlson Court identified this as the

 “Turcotte inference,” referring to the Seventh Circuit’s decision in United States v.

 Turcotte, 405 F.3d 515 (7th Cir. 2005), which held that if the “scienter requirement is

 met with regard to the second part of the analogue definition (knowledge or



                                            25
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 26 of 46                          PageID #: 1642



 representation of similar physiological effects), the jury is permitted—but not

 required—to infer that the defendant also had knowledge of the relevant chemical

 similarities.” Carlson, 810 F.3d at 551 (quoting Turcotte, 405 F.3d at 527). The

 Seventh Circuit found that without such a permissive inference, it may be “extremely

 difficult” and “a significant prosecutorial burden” to prove to a jury that a defendant

 knew about the chemical structure of a substance.3 Id. The Carlson Court concluded

 that:

         [a]lthough evidence of a defendant's knowledge that a particular
         substance has a pharmacological effect similar to that produced by a
         controlled substance is ambiguous proof of scienter by itself, it may be
         probative of the defendant's knowledge of chemical structure when
         considered in the context provided by other evidence. . . . In order,
         therefore, to instruct a jury properly and consistently with the footnotes
         in McFadden, the trial court may instruct that knowledge of similar
         pharmacological effect may be considered as circumstantial evidence,

 3       The Seventh Circuit explained:

         The question of similar chemical structure is particularly nettlesome since, even if such
         chemical similarities exist, and even if the defendant is aware of these similarities, the
         intricacies of chemical science may render it extremely difficult to prove that a
         defendant had such knowledge. As a provisional remedy for this problem, we prescribe
         that, in such cases, if the scienter requirement is met with regard to the second part of
         the analogue definition (knowledge or representation of similar physiological effects),
         the jury is permitted—but not required—to infer that the defendant also had
         knowledge of the relevant chemical similarities. This approach is justified since, as a
         practical matter, defendants who know or represent to others that the substance in
         question has physiological effects similar to a controlled substance are likely to be
         aware of basic chemical similarities as well, even if that fact is difficult to prove
         conclusively.

         This approach also dovetails with the commonsense recognition that, in selling or
         purchasing such substances, all parties to the transaction are primarily interested
         (perhaps solely interested) in the substance's physiological effects. Yet at the same
         time, if the defendant truly had no knowledge of the substance's chemical character,
         or if, under the circumstances, chemical complexities make such knowledge extremely
         unlikely, an avenue should be left open for defendants to refute such an inference. In
         any case, our well-established jurisprudence regarding the scienter requirements of
         controlled substances violations require that juries confront these questions of
         knowledge squarely.

 Turcotte, 405 F.3d at 527-28.

                                                    26

        along with the other evidence, in deciding whether the evidence as a
        whole proved knowledge of similar chemical structure beyond a
        reasonable doubt.

 Id. at 552-53 (citations omitted).         See also Ramos, 2016 WL 497167, at *5 (the

 Government need not present direct evidence of the defendant’s knowledge of the

 analogue’s nature and effects, and could instead “satisfy its burden through

 circumstantial evidence of knowledge”) (citing McFadden, 135 S. Ct. at 2304 n.1).

        Taking a contrary position to the Seventh and Eighth Circuits, the Tenth

 Circuit rejected the “Turcotte inference” and its application to McFadden.4 United

 States v. Makkar, 810 F.3d 1139, 1144-45 (10th Cir. 2015).

 IV.    DISCUSSION

        A.      A Hybrid Indictment and Guilty Plea

        An unusual aspect of Mr. Ketchen’s indictment and guilty pleas is that both

 Count One and Count Three allege violations of two different statutes: the Controlled

 Substance Act and the Analogue Act. Indictment at 1-5. When the DEA issued its

 final order designating MDPV as a schedule I controlled substance on October 21,

        And the plain language of the statute underscores and confirms what McFadden
        clearly explained. As written, the Analogue Act makes it a crime to possess or
        distribute a drug that both (1) is substantially similar in chemical structure to a
        schedule I or II CSA controlled substance, and (2) has, or is represented or intended to
        have, an effect on the central nervous system that is substantially similar to that of a
        schedule I or II CSA controlled substance. Both elements are essential to a conviction
        and the government offers no sensible way or reason why a mens rea requirement
        applied to the statute might take an olympian leap over the first essential element and
        touch down only on the second. Neither can we discern for ourselves any plausible
        argument along these lines.

 Makkar, 810 F.3d at 1146 (emphasis in original).

 2011, conduct that violated the Analogue Act transmogrified into a Controlled

 Substances Act violation.

       Even though Mr. Ketchen now argues that the Supreme Court’s McFadden

 decision casts a pall over his entire guilty plea, during his Rule 11 hearing, Mr.

 Ketchen expressly admitted violating the Controlled Substances Act as well as the

 Analogue Act; significantly, the McFadden decision deals only with the Analogue Act,

 not the Controlled Substances Act. See United States v. Tuttle, No. 15-158-cr, 2016

 U. S. App. LEXIS 7189, *4 (2d Cir. Apr. 21, 2016) (McFadden is “inapposite” to a

 Controlled Substances Act violation).

       Furthermore, unlike the standards in McFadden for Analogue Act cases, for

 Controlled Substance Act cases, the Government “need not have proved beyond a

 reasonable doubt . . . that [the defendants] knew or were willfully blind to the fact

 that the controlled substance was [a particular controlled substance] specifically.”

 United States v. Valbrun, 2:14-cr-00069-JDL-9, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6871, *3 (D.

 Me. Jan. 15, 2016) (quoting United States v. Perez-Melendez, 599 F.3d 31, 41 (1st Cir.

 2010)) (emphasis in original). Under the Controlled Substances Act, the Government

 need only prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew he was in

 possession of a controlled substance, not a specific controlled substance. McFadden,

 135 S. Ct. at 2304 (“The ordinary meaning of § 841(a)(1) thus requires a defendant to

 know only that the substance he is dealing with is some unspecified substance listed

 on the federal drug schedules”); Perez-Melendez, 599 F.3d at 41. Applying these

 principles to Government’s Version of the Offense in this case, the facts Mr. Ketchen



                                          28
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 29 of 46          PageID #: 1645



 admitted were true at the Rule 11 are sufficient under the Controlled Substances Act

 to establish a violation of those parts of Counts One and Three that allege Controlled

 Substances Act violations.

       This leaves Mr. Ketchen is an unusual position. He has not begun to state a

 colorable claim that he is not guilty of violating those portions of Counts One and

 Three that allege he violated the Controlled Substances Act. Accordingly, for that

 reason alone, his attempt to withdraw his guilty pleas to both counts in their entirety

 is without even a plausible foundation. His sole conceivable argument relates to the

 period of time before October 21, 2011, when the Analogue Act applied.

       But once his criminal responsibility under the Controlled Substances Act is

 established, how to treat his pre-October 21, 2011 activity becomes solely a

 sentencing issue. Whether or not his possession of MDPV before October 21, 2011

 should be deemed part of his drug quantity for the offense of conviction under United

 States Sentencing Guideline (U.S.S.G.) § 2D1.1(a)(5) – part of his drug quantity for

 relevant conduct under U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3 – is a sentencing issue. However this issue

 might be resolved at sentencing, it does not justify his motion to withdraw his guilty

 pleas in their entirety.

       Despite the fundamental flaw in his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, the

 Court has analyzed his contentions under the traditional analytic pathway and in

 doing so, the Court has concluded that the result is the same.

       B.     Withdrawal of a Guilty Plea

        “It is common ground that a defendant has no absolute right to withdraw a

 guilty plea.” United States v. Caramadre, 807 F.3d 359, 366 (1st Cir. 2015). “When

 a defendant moves to withdraw a guilty plea after the court has accepted it but before

 the court has sentenced him, he may do so only if he ‘can show a fair and just reason

 for requesting the withdrawal.’” Id. (quoting FED. R. CRIM. P. 11(d)(2)(B)); United

 States v. Gates, 709 F.3d 58, 69 (1st Cir. 2013). “The burden rests with the defendant

 to make this showing.” Caramadre, 807 F.3d at 366; United States v. Marrero–

 Rivera, 124 F.3d 342, 347 (1st Cir. 1997).

       In determining whether a defendant carries his burden, “an inquiring court

 must consider the totality of the circumstances.” United State v. Merritt, 755 F.3d 6,

 9 (1st Cir. 2014).

       This inquiry often gives particular weight to four factors. A typical
       starting point is to ascertain whether the plea was voluntary,
       intelligent, and informed when tendered. . . . From that starting point,
       the inquiry customarily should expand to factors such as the strength of
       the reasons proffered by the defendant as a basis for withdrawing his
       plea, the timing of the motion, and the force of any assertion of legal
       innocence.

 Id. (internal citations and punctuation omitted). “If the court concludes that the

 balance of all the relevant factors tilts in favor of the defendant, then—and only

 then—should the court proceed to factor in the prejudice (if any) that the government

 would suffer were the court to allow the motion to withdraw.” Id. Furthermore, the

 Supreme Court explained:

       [w]ere withdrawal automatic in every case where the defendant decided
       to alter his tactics and present his theory of the case to the jury, the

                                          30
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 31 of 46         PageID #: 1647



       guilty plea would become a mere gesture, a temporary and meaningless
       formality reversible at the defendant’s whim. In fact, however, a guilty
       plea is no such trifle, but a ‘grave and solemn act,’ which is ‘accepted
       only with care and discernment.’

 United States v. Hyde, 520 U.S. 670, 677 (1997) (internal citations omitted).

              1.     Knowing, Intelligent, and Voluntary

       “Critical to the plea-withdrawal inquiry is whether the original guilty plea was

 knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.” Caramadre, 807 F.3d at 366. “To make this

 assessment, courts review the Rule 11 hearing to determine whether the ‘court

 adequately observed the formalities imposed by Rule 11, which are intended to assure

 that the defendant understands the charge and the consequences of the plea.’” United

 States v. Forest, No.CR-08-155-B-W, 2010 WL 2399554, at *5 (D. Me. June 11, 2010)

 (quoting United States v. Padilla-Galarza, 351 F.3d 594, 597 (1st Cir. 2003)). Rule

 11(b) sets forth the district court’s obligation to advise and question the defendant.

 FED. R. CRIM. P. 11(b). “Strict compliance with Rule 11 is ‘quite often dispositive in

 determining whether a defendant has knowingly and voluntarily entered a guilty

 plea.’” Forest, 2010 WL 2399554, at *5 (quoting United States v. Austin, 948 F.2d

 783, 787 (1st Cir. 1991)).

       Mr. Ketchen’s motion to withdraw guilty plea centers on whether his plea was

 made “knowingly.” Citing the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Bigman, 906 F.2d at 394,

 he argues “[d]ue process requires that a defendant be apprised of the nature of the

 charges, including the element of intent,” Def.’s Reply at 5, and asserts that under

 the mens rea requirements set forth in McFadden that the Government failed to show

 in its indictment – and the Court failed to address in the Rule 11 proceeding – that

                                          31
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 32 of 46            PageID #: 1648



 Mr. Ketchen knew that MDPV was a controlled substance analogue prior to October

 21, 2011. Id.

                    a.     The Controlled Substance Act Portion of Counts
                           One and Three

       As the Court has pointed out, Mr. Ketchen’s argument does not address his

 guilty pleas to the charges in the Controlled Substances Act portion of Counts One

 and Three because there is no requirement under the Controlled Substances Act that

 the Government prove that Mr. Ketchen actually knew that the substance he

 possessed for distribution was MDPV, only that he knew it was a controlled

 substance.

       Regarding the Controlled Substances Act part of Counts One and Three, the

 indictment charged in Count One:

       Beginning on a date unknown, but no later than April 1, 2011 and
       continuing until a date unknown, but no earlier than December 31,
       2011, in the District of Maine and elsewhere, defendants . . . knowingly
       and intentionally conspired with one another and with persons known
       and unknown to commit offenses against the United States, namely
       distribution and possession with intent to distribute . . . (2) from October
       21, 2011 until a date unknown, but no earlier than December 31, 2011,
       a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of MDPV, a
       Schedule I controlled substance (by Final Order of DEA, 76 Fed. Reg.
       65371 . . . .

 Indictment at 2-3 (emphasis added). Similar language appears in Count Three. Id.

 at 4-5.

       During the Rule 11 proceeding, the Court read Counts One and Three of the

 Indictment to Mr. Ketchen and he confirmed that he understood them. Tr. 9:1-25.

 The Rule 11 colloquy also complied with all requirements of the Rule. See FED. R.

 CRIM. P. 11(b)(1)-(3). In short, Mr. Ketchen has no claim that he did not knowingly,

 intelligently and voluntarily enter a plea of guilty to the portions of Counts One and

 Three that alleged violations of the Controlled Substances Act.

                    b.     The Analogue Act Portions of Counts One and
                           Three

       Regarding the Analogue Act portions of Counts One and Three, Mr. Ketchen’s

 singular complaint about the Rule 11 proceeding is that the Court failed to anticipate

 the Supreme Court’s McFadden decision by asking him not only whether he

 knowingly and intentionally conspired to distribute MDPV, but also whether he knew

 that the substance with which he had been dealing was in fact a controlled substance.

 In other words, although Mr. Ketchen concedes that the Court asked him whether he

 knowingly and intentionally conspired to distribute MDPV, he complains that the

 Court did not ask him whether he knew that MDPV was a controlled substance. Def.’s

 Mot. at 3 (“[T]here was no inquiry as to whether the government was required to

 establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew he was dealing with a

 substance before October 21, 2011 regulated by the Analogue Act”).

       First, Mr. Ketchen is factually incorrect. The McFadden Court explained that

 the “Government must prove that a defendant knew that the substance with which

 he was dealing was ‘a controlled substance,’ even in prosecutions involving an

 analogue.” McFadden, 135 S. Ct. at 2305. At his Rule 11 proceeding, the Court

 expressly asked Mr. Ketchen that very question. Mr. Ketchen represented to the

 Court that he was pleading guilty to Counts One and Three because he was actually




                                          33
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 34 of 46        PageID #: 1650



 guilty of those crimes and for no other reason. Tr. 7:24-8:5. The Court read Counts

 One and Three:

       Count 1 alleges that beginning on a date unknown, but no later than
       April 1, 2011, and continuing until a date unknown, but no earlier than
       December 31, 2011, in the District of Maine, which means the state of
       Maine, you and a number of other individuals knowingly and
       intentionally conspired with one another to commit an offense against
       the United States, namely, the distribution of MDPV, a controlled
       substance. . . .

       Now, Count 3 of the indictment alleges that beginning on a date
       unknown, but no later than April 1, 2011, and continuing until
       December 31, 2011, in the District of Maine, which, again, means the
       state of Maine, you knowingly leased, rented, used, and maintained,
       permanently or temporarily, a residence located at 10 Blackstone Street,
       Bangor, Maine, for the purpose of unlawfully distributing and using the
       premises to distribute MDPV, again, a controlled substance, in violation
       of federal criminal law.

 Tr. 9:1-25 (emphasis added). Asked whether he understood the charges in Counts

 One and Three, Mr. Ketchen responded that he did. Id. Thus the Court directly

 asked Mr. Ketchen whether he understood that the indictment was alleging that the

 drug he was distributing, MDPV, was “a controlled substance.” He confirmed that he

 understood. This is precisely what McFadden requires. McFadden, 135 S. Ct. at

 2305 (“[T]he Government must prove that a defendant knew that the substance with

 which he was dealing was ‘a controlled substance’”).

       Any possible confusion would have been cleared up by the Government’s

 Version of the Offense in this case. Prosecution Version at 1-3. The Government’s

 Version expressly states that “[b]etween approximately April 1, 2011 and December

 31, 2011, in Penobscot County, Maine and elsewhere, there existed a conspiracy to

 possess with intent to distribute and distribute (1) prior to October 21, 2011, a

                                          34
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 35 of 46           PageID #: 1651



 mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of MDPV, a controlled

 substance analogue as defined in Title 21, United States Code, Section 802(32) . . . .”

 Id. at 1. The Government’s Version states that “[d]uring its existence, the defendant

 knowingly and intentionally joined and participated in the conspiracy.” Id.

       As the McFadden opinion notes, subsection 32 of section 2 of title 21 defines “a

 controlled substance analogue by its features,” including its chemical structure and

 its effect on the central nervous system, and “[a] defendant who possesses a substance

 with knowledge of those features knows all of the facts that make his conduct illegal.”

 McFadden, 135 S. Ct. at 2305. The McFadden Court wrote that “[a] defendant need

 not know of the existence of the Analogue Act to know that he was dealing with ‘a

 controlled substance.’” Id.

       It is true that the Government’s Version in this case does not spell out the exact

 features of MDPV that correspond to the statutory requirements of subsection 32.

 But Mr. Ketchen was represented by counsel and the Court expressly asked Mr.

 Ketchen whether he had had enough time to discuss the charges with his attorney

 and whether his attorney had “explained to you the elements and the nature of the

 offenses charged.” Tr. 8:16-18. Mr. Ketchen confirmed that he had had enough time

 to consult with his lawyer and that his lawyer had explained the elements and nature

 of the offenses charged. Id.

       Specifically regarding the Government’s Version, the Court closely questioned

 both Mr. Ketchen and his counsel. Mr. Ketchen’s attorney confirmed that he was

 satisfied that “the government’s version of the offense can be proved,” id. 15:10-20,



                                           35
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 36 of 46           PageID #: 1652



 and that the “admissible part of that evidence would permit a properly instructed

 jury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that [his] client is guilty of the crimes

 to which he is pleading guilty.” Id. 15:3-7. Mr. Ketchen also confirmed that he

 understood the Government’s Version was an important document, that he had

 carefully read it, and, after being warned by the Court that he had to tell the truth,

 Mr. Ketchen confirmed that the contents of the Government’s Version were true and

 that he did not disagree in any way with the Government’s Version of the offense. Id.

 16:8-17:10.

       Mr. Ketchen must be held to what he represented to the Court at the time of

 the Rule 11 hearing. United States v. Dunfee, No. 15-1031, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS

 7948, *12 (1st Cir. May 2, 2016); United States v. Gates, 709 F.3d 58, 69 (1st Cir.

 2013) (“A defendant is normally bound by the representations that he himself makes

 in open court at the time of his plea”); United States v. Padilla-Galarza, 351 F.3d 594,

 598 (1st Cir. 2003). Mr. Ketchen takes nothing from the fact that the Government’s

 Version used a statutory reference, thereby incorporating the more elaborate

 statutory definition.   If he had questions about the meaning of the statutory

 reference, this is why he had a lawyer, and if he was at all confused, he had a right

 to clarify matters

       Moreover, the contents of the PSR in this case corroborate his guilt not only of

 the Controlled Substances Act portions of Counts One and Three, but also the

 Analogue Act portions of those Counts. In his own words set forth in the PSR, Mr.

 Ketchen admitted he was “turned onto a drug called bath salts ‘MDPV’ by a longtime



                                           36
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 37 of 46            PageID #: 1653



 drug addict,” that the addict told him MDPV was a “rave drug,” and that people “stay

 up all night and go partying all night, dance, have sex or whatever.” PSR ¶ 18. Mr.

 Ketchen admitted his addiction to MDPV was “horrible” and he “started using it and

 increased the use to astronomical proportion.” Id. Although Mr. Ketchen wrote that

 he initially thought the drug was legal, he acknowledged that “[a]t some point I

 became aware that I was selling and using an illegal drug.” Id. He admitted selling

 MDPV “out of my apartment and was clear that the laws changed or at least my

 perception of the law changed. I was not just selling a legal synthetic chemical, I was

 selling an illegal drug and using an illegal substance. I was being supplied an illegal

 drug, selling an illegal drug, and getting enough to use in return.” Id.

       Although Mr. Ketchen does not clarify exactly when it became clear to him that

 he was selling an illegal drug, his statement links his knowledge that MDPV was

 illegal with his selling MDPV out of his apartment and the PSR establishes that he

 was selling MDPV out of his Blackstone Street apartment as early as June or July

 2011, id. ¶ 5, if not earlier. Id. ¶ 13 (May to November). Furthermore, the PSR

 confirms that one of the sources of information began buying MDPV from Mr.

 Ketchen at his residence from May 2011 to November 2011. Id. ¶ 13. In addition,

 Mr. Ketchen was selling a gram of MDPV for $80 per gram. Id. ¶ 5.

       When law enforcement searched his residence on November 10, 2011, they

 found significant quantities of cash, large quantities of MDPV, digital scales,

 packaging material, various drug paraphernalia, notebooks with drug records and

 debts, websites and lists of chemical names, and a safe that contained cash, a variety



                                           37
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 38 of 46          PageID #: 1654



 of scheduled drugs, and more MDPV. Id. ¶ 9. In other words, by November 10, 2011,

 Mr. Ketchen was engaged in a large-scale MDPV operation, one that likely had

 existed before October 21, 2011. In fact, the PSR recommends to the Court that Mr.

 Ketchen be held accountable for dealing MDPV beginning as early as May 2011. Id.

 ¶ 13.

         These combined facts circumstantially demonstrate that Mr. Ketchen knew

 the drugs he was dealing were illegal well before October 21, 2011. McFadden, 135

 S. Ct. at 2304 n.1. During his period of dealing, Mr. Ketchen became aware of the

 highly addictive nature of MDPV from his own “horrible” experience; he was selling

 a gram of the drug at $80, hardly the price one would pay for a legal substance

 available at “a head shop or truck stop,” PSR ¶ 18; he had regular direct customers,

 id. ¶ 13; and he also fronted other drug dealers and received cash or stolen property

 in return. Id. ¶ 6. In short, the PSR’s recitation of the details of his offense speak

 against his sudden discovery after October 21, 2011 that the MDPV he was dealing

 was illegal.

         Furthermore, Mr. Ketchen is “foraging in an empty cupboard”; Rule 11 does

 not require a district court either to spout a fixed catechism or to use a set of magic

 words.” Jones, 778 F.3d at 382 (internal citation omitted). “Nor does the rule demand

 explanations of the ‘technical intricacies of the charges in the indictment’” and “it

 need not be precise to the point of pedantry.” Id. A Rule 11 colloquy “must be

 assessed in light of ‘the attributes of the particular defendant, the nature of the

 specific offense, and the complexity of the attendant circumstances.’” Id. (internal



                                           38
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 39 of 46             PageID #: 1655



 citation omitted). Mr. Ketchen’s nuanced argument asks more of Rule 11 than is

 required and seeks the Court to instead delve into the “technical intricacies of the

 charges in the indictment.” The indictment and the Rule 11 hearing adequately

 appraised Mr. Ketchen of the intent requirements of the charges.

       What’s more, the Court strictly complied with the Rule 11 formalities at Mr.

 Ketchen’s May 7, 2014 hearing. Specifically, the Court, inter alia, found Mr. Ketchen

 to be competent, confirmed that he plead guilty because he was actually guilty and

 did so voluntarily, reviewed the nature of the charges and their consequences with

 Mr. Ketchen and ensured that he understood them, established the accuracy of the

 prosecution version and that there was a factual basis for the guilty plea, advised him

 of the rights he was waiving, and confirmed with his counsel that a properly

 instructed jury could determine beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Ketchen was

 guilty of each of the crimes to which he plead guilty. See Section III(B), supra; see

 also Forest, 2010 WL 2399554, at *5; United States v. Sahlin, 399 F.3d 27, 32–33 (1st

 Cir. 2005); United States v. Santiago, 229 F.3d 313, 317 (1st Cir. 2000).

       McFadden also held that knowledge can be established “by evidence that the

 defendant knew the specific analogue he was dealing with, even if he did not know

 its legal status as an analogue.”    McFadden, 135 S. Ct. at 2305. To do so the

 Government must show that the defendant knew that the substance: (1) has a

 chemical structure “substantially similar to the chemical structure of a controlled

 substance in schedule I or II” (chemical structure element); (2) has a “‘stimulant,

 depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system that is



                                           39
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 40 of 46          PageID #: 1656



 substantially similar to or greater than’ the effect of a controlled substance in

 schedule I or II” (pharmacological similarity element); and (3) that the defendant

 “represented or intended the substance to have that effect with respect to a particular

 person” (human consumption element). Id. (quoting § 802(32)(A)); see also Section

 III(D)(2), supra.

       The human consumption requirement is evident from the record. Additionally,

 as discussed, there is significant circumstantial evidence that Mr. Ketchen knew

 MDPV was pharmacologically similar to a controlled substance before October 21,

 2011: he was told it was a “rave drug” that people do “to stay up all night and go

 partying all night, dance, have sex or whatever” and admitted his addiction to MDPV

 was “horrible”; he frequently bought and sold MDPV with other controlled substances

 (e.g., Xanax, Valium, Klonopin, Vicodin, Suboxone, Methadone, Oxycodone, Ecstasy);

 a search of his residence revealed significant quantities of cash, large quantities of

 MDPV, digital scales, packaging material, various drug paraphernalia, notebooks

 with drug records and debts, websites and lists of chemical names, and a safe that

 contained cash, a variety of scheduled drugs, and more MDPV; his phone call to co-

 conspirators after his arrest advising them of the drugs still in his apartment, which

 were subsequently moved to a number of surreptitious locations; and his

 acknowledgement of the harm his selling of MDPV did to the community. See Section

 III(C), supra.

       The Seventh and Eighth Circuits hold that evidence of pharmacological effect

 “may be considered as circumstantial evidence, along with the other evidence, in



                                           40
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 41 of 46         PageID #: 1657



 deciding whether the evidence as a whole proved knowledge of similar chemical

 structure beyond a reasonable doubt.” Carlson, 810 F.3d at 553 (citing McFadden,

 135 S. Ct. at 2305, nn.1-3); Turcotte, 405 F.3d at 527-28. The Court adopts the

 Carlson and Turcotte Courts’ manifest reasoning that it is “extremely difficult” and

 “a significant prosecutorial burden” to prove to a jury that a defendant knew about

 the chemical structure of a substance. Carlson, 810 F.3d at 551-53; Turcotte, 405

 F.3d at 527-28. The Court determines that, in considering the evidence provided in

 the indictment, the Rule 11 proceeding, and the PSC, a properly instructed jury could

 determine beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Ketchen knew he was dealing with a

 controlled substance analogue before October 21, 2011.

       The Court finds that Mr. Ketchen knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily

 entered his guilty plea.

              2.     The Force of Defendant’s Reasons for Withdrawing the
                     Guilty Plea

       “A defendant may not renounce a guilty plea ‘without advancing a plausible

 reason for so doing.’” Forest, 2010 WL 2399554, at *5 (quoting United States v. Doyle,

 981 F.2d 591, 594 (1st Cir. 1992)). “Plausibility, however, must ‘rest on more than

 the defendant’s second thoughts about some fact or point of law, or about the wisdom

 of his earlier decision.’” Id. (quoting United States v. Parrilla–Tirado, 22 F.3d 368,

 371 (1st Cir. 1994)).

       Mr. Ketchen argues two reasons for withdrawal of his guilty plea: (1) that the

 Court failed to explain the mens rea requirements of Counts One and Three of the

 indictment as required under McFadden, and (2) that the Government cannot prove

                                          41
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 42 of 46         PageID #: 1658



 beyond a reasonable doubt that prior to October 21, 2011 he knew he was possessing

 and distributing a controlled substance analogue. See Def.’s Mem. at 1-3. The Court

 has demonstrated the shortcomings of Mr. Ketchen’s first argument regarding the

 mens rea requirements of the indictment. See Section IV(B)(1)(b), supra. Likewise,

 the Court has illustrated through its analysis under Carlson that sufficient evidence

 exists to demonstrate that Mr. Ketchen knew he was possessing and distributing a

 controlled substance analogue before October 21, 2011. Id.

       The Court concludes that Mr. Ketchen has not presented “a plausible reason”

 for renouncing his earlier guilty plea. Forest, 2010 WL 2399554, at *10.

              3.        The Timing of Mr. Ketchen’s Motion

       The First Circuit has noted that a “long interval between the plea and the

 request often weakens any claim that the plea was entered in confusion or under false

 pretenses.” Id. (quoting Doyle, 981 F.2d at 595). The “longer a defendant waits before

 moving to withdraw his plea, the more potency his motion must have in order to gain

 favorable consideration.” Id. (quoting United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez, 34 F.3d 19,

 23 (1st Cir. 1994)).

       The First Circuit has explained, however, that the “relevant temporal gap” is

 the time between the defendant’s “discovery of the new information and the filing of

 his motion.” Id. (quoting Gonzalez, 202 F.3d at 24, abrogated on other grounds,

 Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010)). The First Circuit has upheld the rejection

 of plea withdrawal motions in which the relevant gap ranged from eight months, id.,

 to thirteen days. United States v. Ramos, 810 F.2d 308, 313 (1st Cir. 1987).



                                          42
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 43 of 46        PageID #: 1659



       The Government highlights that Mr. Ketchen pleaded guilty to Counts One

 and Three on May 7, 2014, and on July 30, 2015 – fourteen months after he pleaded

 guilty – moved to withdraw his guilty plea. Gov’t’s Opp’n at 15. Mr. Ketchen argues

 that the issuance of McFadden constitutes “discovery of the new information” and the

 “relevant temporal gap” should be twelve days – McFadden was decided by the

 Supreme Court on June 18, 2015, and Mr. Ketchen filed his Motion to Withdraw

 Guilty Plea on June 30, 2015. See Def.’s Mot. at 5.

       It is true that the Supreme Court decided McFadden less than two weeks

 before Mr. Ketchen filed his motion. However Supreme Court decisions do not arrive

 unheralded. Even if Mr. Ketchen should not be blamed for missing the issue when it

 was decided on May 10, 2013 at the district court level, United States v. McFadden,

 15 F. Supp. 3d 668 (W.D. Va. 2013), or on May 21, 2014 by the Fourth Circuit, United

 States v. McFadden, 753 F.3d 432 (4th Cir. 2014), the Supreme Court announced the

 issue nationally when it granted certiorari on January 16, 2015. McFadden v. United

 States, 2015 U.S. LEXIS 619 (2015).

       In general, nevertheless, the Court sides with Mr. Ketchen on the timeliness

 of his motion to withdraw because he filed the motion shortly after the Supreme Court

 issued McFadden.

              4.    Assertion of Actual Innocence

       The First Circuit has said that courts should “look more hospitably on a motion

 to withdraw a guilty plea when the motion is coupled with an assertion of innocence.”

 Forest, 2010 WL 2399554, at *11 (quoting Doyle, 981 F.2d at 596). On the other hand,



                                          43
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 44 of 46            PageID #: 1660



 if the defendant does not proclaim his actual innocence, “this factor cuts sharply

 against allowing appellant’s motion to withdraw [his] guilty plea.”           Id. (citing

 Parrilla–Tirado, 22 F.3d at 373); see Doyle, 981 F.2d at 596.

       Mr. Ketchen asserts that there is evidence of his innocence “regarding this very

 narrow issue,” noting that in his statement of acceptance of responsibility he

 maintained that he “was told that they were synthetic research chemicals that were

 legal . . . that you could get it at the head shop and at truck stops. That you could get

 it off the internet.” Def.’s Mem. at 7.

       The Court is deeply skeptical of Mr. Ketchen’s assertion of innocence

 “regarding this very narrow issue.” As the record shows, Mr. Ketchen admitted to

 the Government’s Version of the Offense at his Rule 11 proceeding, the PSR contains

 numerous pages of evidence of his participation in the MDPV conspiracy, and his

 statement in the PSR admits “[a]t some point I became aware that I was selling and

 using an illegal drug. I was out of control. . . . I started selling MDPV out of my

 apartment and was clear that the laws changed or at least my perception of the law

 changed. I was not just selling a legal synthetic chemical, I was selling an illegal

 drug and using an illegal substance.” PSR ¶ 18. Finally, the Court’s analysis found

 that there is sufficient evidence that Mr. Ketchen was selling a controlled substance

 analogue before October 21, 2011. Mr. Ketchen’s qualified assertion of innocence is

 unpersuasive and undermines his request to withdraw his guilty plea.




                                            44
Case 1:13-cr-00133-JAW Document 751 Filed 07/06/16 Page 45 of 46          PageID #: 1661



               5.     Prejudice to the Government

         Before allowing a defendant to withdraw his plea the court must also “consider

 the potential prejudice to the government.” Forest, 2010 WL 2399554, at *13 (quoting

 United States v. Richardson, 225 F.3d 46, 51 (1st Cir. 2000)). However, “[i]f the court

 concludes that the balance of all the relevant factors tilts in favor of the defendant,

 then—and only then—should the court proceed to factor in the prejudice (if any) that

 the government would suffer were the court to allow the motion to withdraw.”

 Merritt, 755 F.3d at 9.

         The Court does not conclude that the balance of relevant factors tilts in the

 favor of Mr. Ketchen. The Court has found that he knowingly, intelligently, and

 voluntarily entered his guilty plea, he has not presented “a plausible reason” for

 renouncing his earlier guilty plea, and he has made no true assertion of innocence.

 The lone factor of the timing of his motion does not rework the totality of

 circumstances in his favor, and as such, the Court does not need to proceed to factor

 in any prejudice the Government would suffer.

         The Court concludes that Mr. Ketchen has failed to meet his burden to show a

 “fair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal” under Federal Rule of Criminal

 Procedure 11(d)(2)(B).

 V.      CONCLUSION

         The Court DENIES Mr. Ketchen’s Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea (ECF No.

 708).
