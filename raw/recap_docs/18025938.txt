                  ORDER AFFIRMING THE
       RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE

        The United States Magistrate Judge filed with the Court on June 5,

  2015 his Recommended Decision (ECF No. 65).     The Petitioner filed his

  objections to the Recommended Decision on June 22, 2015 (ECF No. 66). I

  have reviewed and considered the Magistrate Judge’s Recommended

  Decision, together with the entire record; I have made a de novo

  determination of all matters adjudicated by the Magistrate Judge’s

  Recommended Decision; and I concur with the recommendations of the

  United States Magistrate Judge for the reasons set forth in his

  Recommended Decision, and determine that no further proceeding is

  necessary.

        1. It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the
           Magistrate Judge be and hereby is AFFIRMED.

        2. It is further ORDERED that the Petitioner’s 28 U.S.C. § 2255
           Petition (ECF No. 51) be and hereby is DENIED.

        3. It is further ORDERED that no certificate of appealability should
           issue in the event the Petitioner files a notice of appeal because
           there is no substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional
           right within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).

        SO ORDERED.
