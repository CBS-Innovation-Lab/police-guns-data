                          ORDER ON MOTION TO SUPPRESS

       Charged with illegal possession of two firearms, Bonny L. Reynolds moves to suppress

the firearms, which a police officer found in her bedroom, and the results of a subsequent

forensic test. She argues that the search and subsequent testing should have been conducted

pursuant to a warrant. The Government insists Ms. Reynolds consented to the search and there is

no reason to suppress either the firearms or the test results. The Court denies Ms. Reynolds‟

motion to suppress.

I.     STATEMENT OF FACTS

       A.     The Indictment and Motion to Suppress

       On December 11, 2007, a grand jury indicted Ms. Reynolds for (1) knowingly possessing

two .22 caliber revolvers after having been committed to a mental institution, an alleged

violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(4); and, because the serial number on one of the revolvers was

obliterated, (2) knowingly possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number, an alleged

violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(k). Indictment (Docket # 3). On March 12, 2008, Ms. Reynolds

filed the motion to suppress, Def.’s Mot. to Suppress (Docket # 26) (Def.’s Mot.); the

Government filed its opposition on April 2, 2008, Gov’t’s Resp. to Def.’s Mot. to Suppress

Evidence (Docket # 31) (Gov’t’s Resp.); and, the Court held an evidentiary hearing on March 24,

2009.1 Minute Entry (Docket # 63).

        B.       The Suppression Hearing: Testimony of Officer Scott P.H. Harris

        The only witness at the suppression hearing was Scott Harris, who has been a patrol

officer with the Augusta Police Department for ten years. Officer Harris testified that on May 2,

2006 at 11:00 a.m., he and another officer reported to a single-wide mobile home in response to a

call from a Mr. Bradford. As they proceeded, the officers knew only that Mr. Bradford had

complained that there was a woman in his residence whom he wanted to leave. Upon arrival,

Officer Harris and the other patrol officer, who were both in uniform and in marked patrol cars,

encountered Mr. Bradford outside the mobile home. Mr. Bradford reiterated his complaint and,

according to Officer Harris, said that he had “had enough” of the woman in his residence.

        Before entering the mobile home, Officer Harris asked Mr. Bradford to clarify his and the

unwanted woman‟s living arrangement. Mr. Bradford explained that the unwanted woman,

Bonny Reynolds,2 initially had been invited to stay in the mobile home and keep another woman,

Roxanna Reynolds, company while Mr. Bradford was incarcerated. After Mr. Bradford returned

home, Ms. Reynolds was allowed to remain on the condition that she pay rent. Mr. Bradford,

1
  The delay merits explanation. After her February 19, 2008 arraignment, Ms. Reynolds was released on an
unsecured bond with conditions. Minute Entry (Docket # 13). Based on allegations that she violated the conditions
of her release, Ms. Reynolds was arrested on February 27, 2008, and United States Magistrate Judge Kravchuk
released her the next day on amended conditions. Am. Order Setting Conditions of Release (Docket # 22). Ms.
Reynolds filed the motion to suppress, which the Court referred to Judge Kravchuk, who immediately noticed a
motion hearing for April 29, 2008. Notice of Hr’g on Mot. (Docket # 33). Ms. Reynolds failed to appear, was
arrested the next day, and was ultimately detained. Order of Revocation and Detention Pending Trial (Docket # 40).
Ms. Reynolds‟ apparent inability to comply with conditions of release and to appear as required led the Government
to move for a hearing to determine her competency to stand trial pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 4241(a). Gov’t’s Mot. for
Competency Hr’g and for Psychological or Psychiatric Examination of Def. (Docket # 41). After an evaluation and
hearing pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 4247(d), the Court found on July 30, 2008 that Ms. Reynolds was not competent to
stand trial, and ordered her into the custody of the Attorney General for treatment. Order (Docket # 56). It was not
until March 16, 2009 that the Court found Ms. Reynolds competent to stand trial. Minute Entry (Docket # 60). The
Court quickly scheduled a hearing on both the pending motion to suppress and a newly-filed motion for release for
March 24, 2009.

  Officer Harris referred to the Defendant, Bonny Reynolds, as Bonny Hutchins throughout his testimony. To
maintain consistency with the Indictment, the Court refers to the Defendant as Bonny Reynolds.

who was a tenant himself, said Ms. Reynolds had not been paying rent as agreed. Officer Harris

did not know how long either phase of the living arrangements had lasted, nor did he know how

long Mr. Bradford had been incarcerated. Based on this information, he thought Mr. Bradford‟s

problem sounded more like a civil than a criminal one. Officer Harris agreed that Ms. Reynolds

was starting to sound like a tenant herself, and that, as he understood it, to remove her, a court

would likely have to be involved. Nevertheless, the officers followed Mr. Bradford into the

mobile home to investigate. Officer Harris said he was sure that before entering he would have

asked Mr. Bradford for permission to do so.

        Once inside, Mr. Bradford told the officers that Ms. Reynolds was in the back bedroom

and that she had two unloaded guns. Officer Harris and the other patrol officer proceeded down

the hallway towards the back bedroom with guns drawn. They checked all the rooms on their

way to the back, looking under beds and behind doors. Upon reaching the back bedroom,

Officer Harris knocked on the closed door. He heard a woman from inside the room say “come

in.” The officers entered the bedroom and found Ms. Reynolds lying on her back on the bed.

Officer Harris asked her if she had any guns. Ms. Reynolds said “yes,” and pointed to the

headboard behind her. The guns were not visible. Officer Harris walked alongside the bed

towards the headboard, opened a compartment in the headboard, saw the guns, and removed

them.

        After securing the guns, Officer Harris asked Ms. Reynolds for identification. Ms.

Reynolds said the only identification she had was her social security card. Officer Harris asked

her name, and Ms. Reynolds gave her first name, Bonny, and three last names: Hutchins,

Reynolds, and House. Officer Harris could not remember if he gave the guns to the other officer

at this point, but he did call dispatch and check all three names. At first, it appeared that Ms.

Case 1:07-cr-00086-JAW Document 69 Filed 04/21/09 Page 4 of 22                   PageID #: 143



Reynolds may have been involved in a felony in Madison, Maine but it turned out that charge

had been dropped.     Officer Harris did learn, however, that Ms. Reynolds had been “blue

papered” in April. Officer Harris explained that “blue papered” means that Ms. Reynolds had

been kept in a hospital for psychological evaluation, and that he knew people who had been

“blue papered” are prohibited from possessing guns. Based on this information, Officer Harris

told Ms. Reynolds that he was keeping the guns because she was not allowed to have them. Ms.

Reynolds protested, saying that she needed them because she was practicing to become a deputy

sheriff. Both officers left the mobile home, taking the guns with them. By that time, Officer

Harris had concluded that Ms. Reynolds‟ continued presence in the residence was a civil matter.

       Officer Harris conceded that he had no independent recollection of these events, and that

his recollection was limited to the contents of his contemporaneous written report, which he

reviewed before testifying. Thus, there were several things he could not remember. He was not

sure whether the lights on his patrol car were flashing when he arrived or while he was there; in

all likelihood, they were not. He could not remember if he identified himself as a police officer

when he knocked on Ms. Reynolds‟ door, but he and the other officer were in uniform, and his

badge was visible. Although he remembered that both he and the other officer had drawn their

guns for the walk down the hallway, he was not sure if both guns remained drawn while in Ms.

Reynolds bedroom. He was unable to recall what Ms. Reynolds was wearing, though he said it

was not inappropriate. Likewise, he could not say what she was doing while he was retrieving

the guns from the headboard compartment, but he explained that she was free to leave the entire

time, and at no time was she placed under arrest, handcuffed, or physically searched. Finally, he

was unable to explain exactly what he did with the guns when he called dispatch; he thought he

may have given them to the other officer.

         There were also several things that Officer Harris remembered he did not do. He never

asked Ms. Reynolds for permission to look in the headboard compartment, to remove the guns,

or take them with him when he left. He never asked Mr. Bradford for permission to do these

things, either. He explained that he did not ask for permission because he was concerned with

officer safety.

II.      DISCUSSION

         Ms. Reynolds argues that all evidence obtained as a result of the warrantless search of her

bedroom must be suppressed at trial, because the search violated her constitutional rights. Def.’s

Mot. at 1. The Government responds that Ms. Reynolds consented to the search and that her

suppression arguments are therefore meritless. Gov’t’s Resp. at 9-10.

         A.       General Principles

         The Fourth Amendment protects individuals from “unreasonable searches and seizures.”

U.S. CONST. amend. IV. “A search compromises the individual interest in privacy; a seizure

deprives the individual of dominion over his or her person or property.” Horton v. California,

496 U.S. 128, 133 (1990); Segura v. United States, 468 U.S. 796, 806 (1984) (noting that the

Fourth Amendment safeguards different interests). A search occurs when “an expectation of

privacy that society is prepared to consider reasonable is infringed.” United States v. Jacobsen,

466 U.S. 109, 113 (1984); United States v. Samboy, 433 F.3d 154, 161 (1st Cir. 2005). On the

other hand, a seizure of property “occurs when there is some meaningful interference with an

individual‟s possessory interests in that property.”3 Jacobsen, 466 U.S. at 113; Tower v. Leslie-


3
  Quoting Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730, 747 (1983) (Stevens, J., concurring), the First Circuit has recognized that
“„there are important differences‟” between searches and seizures. United States v. Giannetta, 909 F.2d 571, 578
(1st Cir. 1990). At the same time, the First Circuit has observed that there is a “categorical interchangeability of
searches and seizures in terms of [F]ourth [A]mendment analysis” and has assigned “minimal weight to the
search/seizure distinction.” United States v. Cardona, 903 F.2d 60, 64 (1st Cir. 1990) (“[T]he span of possible
searches overlaps, almost perfectly, with the span of possible seizures in the extent to which they, respectively, may
or may not infringe upon [F]ourth [A]mendment interests.”).

                                                          5
Case 1:07-cr-00086-JAW Document 69 Filed 04/21/09 Page 6 of 22                   PageID #: 145



Brown, 326 F.3d 290, 297 (1st. Cir. 2003). The Supreme Court recently explained that the

exclusionary rule, which “forbids the use of improperly obtained evidence at trial,” is a

“judicially created rule . . . „designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through

its deterrent effect.‟” Herring v. United States, __ U.S. __, 129 S. Ct. 695, 699 (2009) (quoting

United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 348 (1974)).

       B.     Officer Harris’ Warrantless Search of Ms. Reynolds’ Bedroom

              1.      Validity of Consensual Searches under the Fourth Amendment

       A search of a person‟s home “is generally not reasonable without a warrant issued on

probable cause.” Maryland v. Buie, 494 U.S. 325, 331 (1990); United States v. Jones, 187 F.3d

210, 219 (1st Cir. 1999) (noting the general rule that “„warrantless searches are presumptively

unreasonable‟” (quoting Horton, 496 U.S. at 133)). The dual requirements of a warrant and

probable cause, however, are subject to well-recognized exceptions; one of which, a consensual

search, is a “„specifically established exception[] to the [Fourth Amendment] requirements of

both a warrant and probable cause.‟” United States v. Melendez, 301 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir. 2002)

(second alteration in original) (quoting Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 219 (1973)).

Although consent need not be express and may be “inferred from conduct,” it must be voluntary

to be valid. United States v. Winston, 444 F.3d 115, 121 (1st Cir. 2006) (referring to consent

inferred from conduct as “implied-in-fact” consent); United States v. McCurdy, 480 F. Supp. 2d

380, 388 (D. Me. 2007). “„The existence of consent and the voluntariness thereof are questions

of fact to be determined from all the circumstances surrounding the search.‟” Winston, 444 F.3d

at 121 (quoting United States v. Miller, 589 F.2d 1117, 1130 (1st Cir. 1978)).             These

circumstances include “the interaction between the police and the person alleged to have given

consent.”   United States v. Weidul, 325 F.3d 50, 53 (1st Cir. 2003).        In addition to the



                                               6
Case 1:07-cr-00086-JAW Document 69 Filed 04/21/09 Page 7 of 22                                   PageID #: 146



requirement that it be based on valid consent, “[a] consensual search may not exceed the scope

of the consent given.” Melendez, 301 F.3d at 32 (internal quotation omitted). The Government

must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the consent given was valid and that the

search did not exceed its scope. Winston, 444 F.3d at 121; Melendez, 301 F. 3d at 32.

                 2.       Ms. Reynolds’ Implied-in-fact Consent

        Ms. Reynolds‟ first argument is that she did not consent to Officer Harris‟ search of the

headboard behind her bed.4 She explains that because Officer Harris did not inform her of his

intention to search for firearms and seize any he found, “it is not reasonable to assume that [she]

consented to [his] searching for the gun by opening the headboard compartment.” Def.’s Mot. at

3-4. Further assuming her subjective understanding of Officer Harris‟ intention to search is

relevant, she goes on to say “[t]here is no context in which the court could find that [she] had a

notion as to what the officer‟s intentions were regarding the firearms.”5                        Id. at 4.     The

Government contends that the search was “properly the result of voluntary consent” and was

“objectively reasonable and limited to the items for which consent had been obtained.” Gov’t’s

Resp. at 9.

        Whether Ms. Reynolds‟ gesture towards the headboard compartment was implied-in-fact

consent to search is a close question. Winston is the most recent First Circuit authority on the

issue. In Winston, the defendant was indicted for distributing cocaine and agents went to his

4
  Ms. Reynolds does not contest the officers‟ right to enter the mobile home and proceed to her door. The officers‟
actions to that point had been authorized by Mr. Bradford, the co-tenant. United States v. Matlock, 415 U.S. 164,
171 (1974); United States v. Jimenez, 419 F.3d 34, 40 (1st Cir. 2005). Also, Ms. Reynolds has not challenged the
officers‟ entry into her bedroom, presumably because when they knocked on the closed door, she invited them in.
5
  The Court disagrees with Ms. Reynolds‟ implication that a finding of consent requires that the person consenting
was aware that she was free to withhold her consent and understood the possible consequences of consenting (e.g.,
search, seizure, arrest, and prosecution). This implied requirement of awareness and understanding conflicts with
the Supreme Court‟s determination in Schneckloth that consent to search need not be knowing and intelligent, but
only freely and voluntarily given. Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 246 (rejecting application of the waiver requirements of
Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458 (1938), to analysis of consensual searches under Fourth Amendment); United States
v. Schaefer, 87 F.3d 562, 569 (1st Cir. 1996); United States v. Nelsen, No. 05-98-P-S, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12610,
at *12 (D. Me. Mar. 22, 2006).

house to execute an arrest warrant. 444 F.3d at 116-17. Once inside the defendant‟s house, the

agents cuffed the defendant‟s hands behind his back and asked him for identification. Id. at 117.

The defendant told them his identification was in the nightstand in the bedroom. Id. Unable to

find the nightstand themselves, the agents brought the defendant into the bedroom and asked him

again where his identification was; this time, the defendant pointed to the nightstand with his

shoulder. Id. The agents opened the drawer in the nightstand and found a large amount of cash,

which the defendant later moved to suppress, arguing that the search violated his Fourth

Amendment rights. Id.

       The First Circuit observed that these facts “clearly support” the conclusion that the

defendant consented to the search. Id. at 121. Cognizant that the agents‟ questions and the

defendant‟s verbal and nonverbal responses had nothing to do with permission to search, the

Winston court explained: “While the agents did not explicitly ask for permission to open the

drawer to retrieve Winston‟s identification, the circumstances described would reasonably lead

the agents to conclude that Winston was consenting to the opening of the drawer in the

nightstand to allow for the retrieval of his wallet and identification.” Id. The court noted that it

was not of “decisive significance” that the defendant‟s consent was nonverbal. Id. at 122 (citing

Robbins v. MacKenzie, 364 F.2d 45, 48 (1st Cir. 1966)). With respect to voluntariness, the court

acknowledged that an in-home arrest pursuant to a search warrant at the hands of armed agents

was an “inherently coercive situation,” but it did not “preclude a finding of voluntariness.” Id.

(citing United States v. Watson, 423 U.S. 411, 424 (1976)).

       Although Winston offers guidance, it does not compel a particular result. Unlike the

defendant in Winston, who responded nonverbally to a question about the location of certain

property, Ms. Reynolds responded nonverbally to a question about the existence of certain



                                                 8
Case 1:07-cr-00086-JAW Document 69 Filed 04/21/09 Page 9 of 22                                       PageID #: 148



property. Both Officer Harris and the agent in Winston understood these responses as consent to

search for the property. In the Court‟s view, Ms. Reynolds makes more out of this difference

than is warranted. At bottom, in the context of this case, the difference between existence and

location of personal property is slight. When the two police officers entered her bedroom and

asked her about weapons, it is only common sense that they were going to locate and secure

them. Thus, when Ms. Reynolds voluntarily shared with Officer Harris the location of the guns,

it is likely that she knew he intended to find them. In other words, her actions belie her current

argument that she had no idea he intended to search. Moreover, without any analysis of the

defendant‟s subjective understanding of the circumstances, the First Circuit in Winston had little

trouble concluding that the defendant‟s gesture towards the nightstand with his shoulder

constituted implied-in fact consent on which the agents reasonably relied when they conducted

their search. The Court concludes that Ms. Reynolds‟ gesture towards the headboard likewise

constituted implied-in-fact consent on which Officer Harris reasonably relied when he searched

for the guns.6

                  3.       Voluntariness

         The First Circuit has instructed that voluntariness of consent is assessed by considering

the totality of the circumstances:

         The court should take into account factors such as the consenting party‟s age,
         education, experience, intelligence, and knowledge of the right to withhold

6
  A small part of the Winston court‟s implied-in-fact consent analysis depended on the object of the search:
“Favoring a finding of implied-in-fact consent in this case is the fact that a request for information about the location
of [the defendant‟s] identification is much more benign than a request for information about the location of
weapons.” Winston, 444 F.3d at 122. Even though Winston noted that “„[i]n the ordinary course a police officer is
free to ask a person for identification without implicating the Fourth Amendment,‟” id. at 121 (quoting Hiibel v.
Sixth Judicial Dist. Court, 542 U.S. 177, 185 (2004)), Winston nowhere suggested that the agents‟ search of the
nightstand did not constitute a Fourth Amendment search. The Court interprets the First Circuit‟s reference to a
question about weapons simply to mean that some questions are less benign than others. The Court does not view
this reference to suggest that where, as here, an officer seeks weapons he has at least reasonable suspicion if not
probable cause to believe are in a room, a more direct and intrusive question as to their location forecloses a finding
of implied-in-fact consent.

                                                           9
Case 1:07-cr-00086-JAW Document 69 Filed 04/21/09 Page 10 of 22                                 PageID #: 149



        consent. Further considerations include whether the consenting party was
        advised of his or her constitutional rights and whether permission to search was
        obtained by coercive means or under inherently coercive circumstances.

United States v. Dunbar, 553 F.3d 48, 57 (1st Cir. 2009) (internal quotation omitted). The

Government argues that Ms. Reynolds‟ consent was voluntary because she is an adult and “was

not detained, handcuffed or placed under arrest and the police used no overtly coercive tactics.”

Gov’t’s Resp. at 7. The Government glosses over several factors the Court must consider under

Dunbar. First, the Government adduced no evidence of Ms. Reynolds‟ education, experience,

intelligence, or knowledge of the right to withhold consent. In fact, Ms. Reynolds apparently

had been committed to a mental institution a month before the search, and it is reasonable to

infer that her ability to understand and exercise her right to withhold consent may have been

impaired at the time of the search. Second, there is no indication that Ms. Reynolds was advised

of her right to refuse her consent. Third, on this evidence, the Court cannot conclude that it was

more likely than not that the officers announced their identity as police officers or holstered their

guns before they entered Ms. Reynolds‟ bedroom.7 Thus, by responding to a late-morning knock

on her closed bedroom door, Ms. Reynolds found herself supine on her bed in sudden, close

company with armed patrol officers.

        These factors weigh in favor of involuntariness. On the other side of the scale is Winston,

in which the First Circuit found voluntary consent notwithstanding the fact that it was given

while under arrest in an “inherently coercive situation,” Winston, 444 F.3d at 122. For this

proposition, the First Circuit cited United States v. Watson, in which the Supreme Court

observed that “the fact of custody alone has never been enough in itself to demonstrate a coerced

7
  Officer Harris could not remember whether he and his companion had holstered their weapons before entering Ms.
Reynolds‟ bedroom. The Court finds they likely did not. Mr. Bradford had told them that Ms. Reynolds was in the
back room with two unloaded guns. Accordingly, both officers had drawn their guns for their investigatory trip
down the hallway to her room. It makes no sense that the officers would have holstered their weapons in advance of
their encounter with Ms. Reynolds, whom they had a reason to believe was potentially armed.

                                                       10
Case 1:07-cr-00086-JAW Document 69 Filed 04/21/09 Page 11 of 22                                    PageID #: 150



. . . consent to search.” 423 U.S. 411, 424 (1976). Here, Ms. Reynolds was not in custody. To

the contrary, she was in her own bedroom. Moreover, even though the presence of police

officers with drawn revolvers carries some inherent force, the Court still infers from Officer

Harris‟ testimony and Ms. Reynolds‟ cooperation that the situation in the bedroom was at the

less coercive spectrum of similar situations. There was no suggestion of tension, raised voices,

affirmative assertions of law enforcement authority, direct coercion, or Ms. Reynolds‟ objection.

The Court concludes that the presence of the armed officers does not by itself render Ms.

Reynolds‟ consent involuntary.

         The parties provide no guidance on how to interpret other factors that weigh against

voluntariness. The fact that Ms. Reynolds was allegedly committed to a mental institution

shortly before the search gives the Court pause. The Court has not been provided with any

details associated with that commitment or with her history of mental illness.8 Thus, even

though the Supreme Court in Watson noted that an indication in the record that a consenting

defendant is “mentally deficient,” 423 U.S. at 425, may also weigh against voluntariness, there is

no direct evidence here—only inferences that could be drawn from Ms. Reynolds‟ prior

commitment. Further, there is no evidence from which the Court could conclude that at the time

of the search Ms. Reynolds was to any extent affected by underlying mental illness.

         Considering the Dunbar factors, the Court finds the Government has met its burden of

establishing by a preponderance that Ms. Reynolds‟ consent was voluntary.                            There is no

indication that she was mentally deficient, nor is there an indication that her will was overborne

by overtly coercive police conduct. Although the situation may have been inherently coercive,

this is not determinative; the fact that Ms. Reynolds immediately responded to Officer Harris‟

8
  Because it presided over the her competency hearing, it has some evidence as to her mental health background, but
the parties did not ask the Court to consider evidence from that hearing in resolving this suppression issue, and the
Court has not done so.

question, and volunteered more information than he sought, shows that she was not coerced into

doing so. Winston, 444 F.3d at 122.

               4.      Scope

        The First Circuit has said that “[a] search justified by consent will be deemed reasonable

as long as it does not exceed the scope of the consent given.” United States v. Jones, 523 F.3d

31, 38 (1st Cir. 2008). To determine the scope of consent, courts apply a test of objective

reasonableness—“what would the typical reasonable person have understood by the exchange

between the officer and the suspect?” Florida v. Jimeno, 500 U.S. 248, 251 (1991); Jones, 523

F.3d at 38. Here, it was objectively reasonable for Officer Harris to search for guns in the

compartment that Ms. Reynolds pointed to in response to his question regarding the presence of

guns.

               5.      The Consensual Search was Reasonable

        Because Ms. Reynolds voluntarily consented to Officer Harris‟ search, and Officer

Harris‟ search did not exceed the scope of her consent, the Court concludes that Officer Harris‟

search for the guns was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.

        C.     Officer Harris’ Warrantless Seizure of the Guns

        A conclusion that the search was reasonable does not end the controversy. Officer Harris

ultimately removed the guns from the mobile home without a warrant. At some point between

his removal of the guns from the headboard compartment and his departure from the scene, he

seized them, implicating the Fourth Amendment. See Jacobsen, 466 U.S. at 113 (defining

seizure of property as “some meaningful interference with an individual‟s possessory interests in

that property”).    Because Ms. Reynolds generally argued that the seized guns should be

suppressed, the Court is tasked with determining whether the warrantless seizure passes muster



                                                12
Case 1:07-cr-00086-JAW Document 69 Filed 04/21/09 Page 13 of 22                                    PageID #: 152



under the Fourth Amendment, and, if it does not, whether the exclusionary rule requires that the

guns be suppressed.9 The Court turns to Ms. Reynolds‟ claim of unreasonable seizure mindful

that “the span of possible searches overlaps, almost perfectly, with the span of possible seizures

in the extent to which they, respectively, may or may not infringe upon [F]ourth [A]mendment

interests.” United States v. Cardona, 903 F.2d 60, 64 (1st Cir. 1990).

                  1.       Validity of Warrantless Seizures under the Fourth Amendment

         Like a search, a seizure of personal property is “per se unreasonable within the meaning

of the Fourth Amendment unless it is accomplished pursuant to a judicial warrant issued upon

probable cause and particularly describing the items to be seized.” United States v. Place, 462

U.S. 696, 701 (1983). The per se rule does not apply, however, if “the police can show that [the

seizure] falls within one of a carefully defined set of exceptions [to the warrant requirement]

based on the presence of „exigent circumstances,‟” or the plain view doctrine. Coolidge v. New

Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 465, 474-75 (1971).

         In this Circuit, the test for determining exigent circumstances “is whether there is such a

compelling necessity for immediate action as will not brook the delay of obtaining a warrant.”

United States v. Almonte, 952 F.2d 20, 22 (1st Cir. 1991) (internal quotation omitted). For

example, “[a]n officer‟s reasonable belief that the delay needed to obtain a warrant would pose

„a threat to police or the public safety‟ is sufficient to create exigent circumstances.” Fletcher v.


9
  Ms. Reynolds‟ arguments relating to Officer Harris‟ seizure of the guns are somewhat opaque. Her primary
argument, that Officer Harris‟ removal of the guns from their compartment was unlawful, is based on her claim that
she did not consent to his search. See Def.’s Mot. at 4-6. She then offers what appears at first blush to be an
alternative argument that would presumably apply in the event the Court concludes that she did consent and the
search was reasonable. She contends Officer Harris‟ removal of the guns cannot be justified by his safety concerns.
Id. at 4 (listing various alternative courses of action that would have preserved officer safety without violating Ms.
Reynolds‟ constitutional rights). But, according to this alternative argument, Officer Harris should have pursued the
enumerated alternative courses of action before the guns were in plain view. Id. The Court has already concluded
that Officer Harris reasonably exposed the guns to plain view pursuant to a consensual search. In light of this
conclusion, the Court cannot—without assistance or resort to its own imagination—determine the import of Ms.
Reynolds‟ officer safety argument.

Town of Clinton, 196 F.3d 41, 49 (1st Cir. 1999) (emphasis in original) (quoting United States v.

Curzi, 867 F.2d 36, 42 (1st Cir. 1989)). The “„standard of reasonableness is comparatively

generous to the police in cases where potential danger, emergency conditions or other exigent

circumstances are present.‟”10 Id. (quoting Roy v. Inhabitants of Lewiston, 42 F.3d 691, 695 (1st

Cir. 1994)). Analysis of exigent circumstances is fact intensive; after all, the “exceptions—by

their very nature—turn upon the objective reasonableness of ad hoc, fact-specific assessments

contemporaneously made by government agents in light of the developing circumstances at the

scene.” McCabe v. Life-Line Ambulance Serv., Inc., 77 F.3d 540, 545 (1st Cir. 1996).

         In addition to the exigent circumstances exception, the plain view doctrine allows for

warrantless seizure of property under limited circumstances. Coolidge, 403 U.S. at 465-66;

United States v. Jones, 187 F.3d 210, 219 (1st Cir. 1999). As the First Circuit has explained, the

plain view doctrine allows a seizure where “(1) the seizing police officer lawfully reached the

position from which he could see the item in plain view; (2) the seizure satisfied the probable

cause standard; and (3) the seizing officer had a lawful right of access to the object itself.”

United States v. Antrim, 389 F.3d 276, 283 (1st Cir. 2004) (internal quotation omitted).

         Although exigent circumstances and the plain view doctrine allow for warrantless

seizures of personal property, neither dispenses with the probable cause requirement. Id.; United

States v. Khounsavanh, 113 F.3d 279, 283 (1st Cir. 1997) (noting that the requirement of

probable cause “is rigorously adhered to” (citing Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U.S. 321, 326-27

(1987))). The First Circuit has stated that:



10
   The First Circuit once enumerated commonly occurring exigent circumstances: “(1) hot pursuit of a fleeing felon;
(2) threatened destruction of evidence inside a residence before a warrant can be obtained; (3) a risk that the suspect
may escape from the residence undetected; or (4) a threat, posed by a suspect, to the lives or safety of the public, the
police officers, or to [an occupant].” United States v. Tibolt, 72 F.3d 965, 969 (1st Cir. 1995) (alteration in original)
(internal quotation omitted).

       [p]robable cause to support a plain view seizure requires more than hunch,
       guesswork, and cop-on-the-beat intuition, but less than proof beyond a reasonable
       doubt or a near certainty that the seized item is incriminating. There must be
       enough facts for a reasonable person to believe that the items in plain view may
       be contraband or evidence of a crime.

United States v. Giannetta, 909 F.2d 571, 579 (1st Cir. 1990) (citations and internal quotation

omitted); see Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294, 309-10 (1967) (abolishing distinction between

evidence of crime and contraband, fruits, and instrumentalities of crime, and noting that all are

subject to seizure).

               2.      The Government’s Justifications for the Warrantless Seizure

       The Government makes two points with respect to seizure. First, it argues that Ms.

Reynolds‟s guns “were legally seized and examined pursuant to consent.” Gov’t’s Resp. at 1.

The Court is not convinced. The Fourth Amendment prohibitions against unreasonable searches

and seizures safeguard different interests. Segura, 468 U.S. at 806. Therefore, it does not follow

from the Court‟s conclusion that Ms. Reynolds consented to the search that she also consented to

the seizure. In fact, according to Officer Harris, she explicitly objected to the seizure. She

protested that he could not take the guns because she was practicing to become a deputy sheriff.

Under these circumstances, the Court does not agree that consent serves as an exception to both

the warrant and probable cause requirements with respect to the seizure of the guns.

       The Government also claims that the police may seize “any evidence uncovered” during a

consensual search. Gov’t’s Resp. at 5 (emphasis added) (citing Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 219).

This may be true as a general proposition, but the Government does not explain what crime, if

any, Officer Harris thought Ms. Reynolds‟ guns were evidence of when he first removed them

from the headboard compartment. In other words, the Government fails to demonstrate that Ms.

Reynolds‟ guns were subject to seizure under the plain view doctrine at the moment Officer



                                               15
Case 1:07-cr-00086-JAW Document 69 Filed 04/21/09 Page 16 of 22                                    PageID #: 155



Harris removed them from the headboard compartment.11 However, this failure is only relevant

if a Fourth Amendment seizure occurred at that moment and the circumstances rendered that

seizure unreasonable. See Tower v. Leslie-Brown, 326 F.3d 290, 297 (1st Cir. 2003).

         For her part, Ms. Reynolds does not argue that the guns were seized the moment Officer

Harris removed them from the headboard compartment. Nor does she argue as a general matter

that they were seized without probable cause. Indeed, in setting up her argument that the

subsequent forensic testing of the guns constituted an unreasonable search, she states: “That the

officer seized the weapons based upon apparent probable cause to believe it was [sic] evidence

of the crime of unlawful possession does not justify the later warrantless search of the weapons.”

Def.’s Mot. at 5. Given the lacunae in the parties‟ respective memoranda, out of an abundance of

caution, the Court determines that Officer Harris‟ seizure of the guns was reasonable and did not

violate the Fourth Amendment, regardless of when it occurred.

                  3.       Analysis of the Warrantless Seizure

                           a.       The Seizure Was Reasonable if it Occurred When the Guns
                                    Were Removed from the Headboard Compartment



11
   The problem the Government faces here is that Officer Harris and his companion did not know Ms. Reynolds‟
possession of the guns was unlawful under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(4) until Officer Harris called dispatch and learned
that she had been “blue-papered” several weeks before. Nor did they know that the serial number on one of the guns
had been obliterated, rendering it unlawful for anyone to possess under 18 U.S.C. § 922(k). Information acquired
after seizure of property may not form the basis of probable cause for that seizure. See Jacobsen, 466 U.S. at 115
(“The reasonableness of an official invasion of the citizen‟s privacy must be appraised on the basis of the facts as
they existed at the time that invasion occurred.”); United States v. Bizier, 111 F.3d 214, 217 (1st Cir. 1997)
(applying this principle to information acquired after an arrest). Cases that approve of plain view seizures of
firearms are generally based on determinations that probable cause existed, at the time of the seizure, to believe the
firearm was an instrumentality of crime or connected with criminal activity, or that the person who possessed the
firearm was a prohibited person under federal law. See United States v. Antrim, 389 F.3d 276, 283 (1st Cir. 2004)
(seizure upheld because gun was found during search for evidence of heroin trafficking pursuant to a warrant);
United States v. Coraine, 198 F.3d 306, 307-08, 310 & n.5 (1st Cir. 1999) (seizure of several firearms upheld
because defendant, whose house police consensually searched for evidence of illegal gaming activity, was a
convicted felon); United States v. Smith, 899 F.2d 116, 117-18 (1st Cir. 1990) (seizure of several firearms upheld
because one officer, who along with others searched defendant‟s apartment for drugs pursuant to a warrant, knew
defendant was a felon and that federal law prohibited him from possessing firearms); United States v. Friel, 448 F.
Supp. 2d 222, 227 (D. Me. 2006) (seizure of gun found during search for drugs pursuant to a warrant upheld because
officers knew defendant was a felon and gun was evidence of the crime of unlawful possession).

                                                         16
Case 1:07-cr-00086-JAW Document 69 Filed 04/21/09 Page 17 of 22                   PageID #: 156



       Officer Harris could not remember exactly what he did with the guns after he removed

them from the headboard compartment; he might have handed them to his companion, who was

also in Ms. Reynolds‟ bedroom. At any rate, he explained that he secured the guns because he

was concerned for officer safety. Assuming Officer Harris‟ actions constituted a seizure because

he meaningfully interfered with Ms. Reynolds‟ possessory interests in the guns, that seizure was

reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.

       The Supreme Court has indicated that the plain view exception permits the warrantless

seizure of “objects dangerous in themselves.” Coolidge, 403 U.S. at 472. The Court has also

observed that an officer may conduct a limited protective search for concealed weapons and

neutralize the threat of physical harm during an investigative stop when he “is justified in

believing that the individual whose suspicious behavior he is investigating at close range is

armed and presently dangerous to the officer or to others.” Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 24 (1968).

In Adams v. Williams, the Court explained that “[t]he purpose of this limited search is not to

discover evidence of crime, but to allow the officer to pursue his investigation without fear of

violence, and thus the frisk for weapons might be equally necessary and reasonable, whether or

not carrying a concealed weapon violated any applicable state law.” 407 U.S. 143, 146 (1972);

United States v. Campa, 234 F.3d 733, 737-38 (1st Cir. 2000).

       In United States v. Bishop, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit synthesized

Coolidge and Terry and held that “a police officer who discovers a weapon in plain view may at

least temporarily seize that weapon if a reasonable officer would believe, based on specific and

articulable facts, that the weapon poses an immediate threat to officer or public safety.” 338

F.3d 623, 628 (6th Cir. 2003). In Bishop, an officer went to a residence in a rural area to serve

an arrest warrant on a theft suspect. Id. at 625. On his approach to the suspect‟s home, the



                                               17
Case 1:07-cr-00086-JAW Document 69 Filed 04/21/09 Page 18 of 22                    PageID #: 157



officer observed Bishop, a person he knew had a reputation for violent behavior, sitting in a car

in the driveway. Id. After learning the suspect was not at home, the officer retraced his steps;

this time, the car in the driveway was unoccupied, and a handgun, half hidden by a cushion on

the driver‟s seat, was visible through an open window. Id. The officer removed the gun because

he was concerned for his safety, determined it was loaded, and discovered that there was an

outstanding warrant for Bishop‟s arrest. Id. Bishop was later charged with being a felon in

possession of a firearm, and, after the district court suppressed the gun, the Sixth Circuit

reversed. The appeals court based its approval of the seizure both on the officer‟s safety

concerns under Terry, and on the fact that the gun was contraband because it was loaded and left

in an unattended vehicle in violation of state law. Id. at 628-29.

       Other appellate courts have approved of plain view seizures of weapons under either the

Coolidge rationale, the Terry rationale, or, like the Sixth Circuit in Bishop, a combination of the

two. See United States v. Purcell, 236 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir. 2001) (stating that an officer

conducting a traffic stop “may seize any contraband, including weapons, in plain view” (citing

Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032, 1049 (1983))); United States v. Tellez, No. 94-10573, 1995

U.S. App. LEXIS 36964, at *3 (9th Cir. Dec. 14, 1995) (“Law enforcement officers may seize

any weapon that is in plain view to protect themselves from injury.”); United States v. Robinson,

756 F.2d 56, 60 (8th Cir. 1985) (concluding that temporary seizure of handgun found in plain

view was a reasonable precaution for safety of persons on premises; when officers learned of

prior conviction, handgun became subject to seizure as illegal weapon possessed by felon); see

also Wayne R. LaFave, 3 Search and Seizure § 7.5(b), at 677 n.28 (4th ed. 2004) (citing Bishop).

       In light of this authority, the Court concludes that Officer Harris‟ temporary seizure of

the guns was reasonable, and did not violate Ms. Reynolds‟ rights guaranteed by the Fourth



                                                 18
Case 1:07-cr-00086-JAW Document 69 Filed 04/21/09 Page 19 of 22                    PageID #: 158



Amendment. Officer Harris exposed the guns to plain view in the course of a consensual search.

He was entitled not to believe Mr. Bradford that the guns were unloaded, and was further entitled

to suspect that his safety would be needlessly jeopardized if he were to turn his back on Ms.

Reynolds with the guns close at hand. By temporarily seizing the guns, he assured that the

remainder of his investigation into Ms. Reynolds‟ background could be conducted under

peaceful circumstances. See Adams, 407 U.S. at 146. If a Fourth Amendment seizure occurred

at that moment, it was not an unreasonable one.

                      b.      The Seizure Was Reasonable if it Occurred When the Guns
                              Were Ultimately Removed from the Premises

       By the time Officer Harris departed the premises with the guns in his possession and

control, he knew that Ms. Reynolds had been “blue papered” and that it was unlawful for her to

possess the guns. This ultimate seizure satisfies the First Circuit‟s test for a lawful plain view

seizure: By virtue of Ms. Reynolds consent, Officer Harris lawfully reached the position from

which he could see the guns and had a lawful right of access to the guns. Further, based on her

response to his request for identification, he had developed probable cause to believe the guns

were evidence of the crime of unlawful possession by the time of the ultimate seizure. See

Antrim, 389 F.3d at 283; Giannetta, 909 F.2d at 579; see also Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Court,

542 U.S. 177, 185 (2004) (“In the ordinary course a police officer is free to ask a person for

identification without implicating the Fourth Amendment.”).          Therefore, the seizure was

reasonable and did not violate Ms. Reynolds‟ rights guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment.

       D.      The Warrantless Forensic Testing

       Ms. Reynolds finally contends that even if the Court concludes that the search of her

bedroom and seizure of the guns was reasonable, the subsequent forensic testing should have

been conducted pursuant to a warrant. The Government disagrees and argues that “[a]n object

                                                19
Case 1:07-cr-00086-JAW Document 69 Filed 04/21/09 Page 20 of 22                   PageID #: 159



lawfully seized may be kept pending trial and may be subject to scientific testing and

examination.” Gov’t’s Resp. at 9-10.

       The Court notes that neither the Government nor Ms. Reynolds introduced any evidence

on the testing issue at the suppression hearing. According to the parties‟ memoranda, which

disclose no controversy over the facts, on May 4, 2006 Augusta police turned over the two guns

to federal agents, who examined them to determine their origins, serial numbers, and the details

of their make and model. Id. at 3-4. In the course of this investigation, the agents discovered

that the serial number on one of the guns was obliterated, and, by magnetic and chemical

analysis, the agents were able to determine the weapon‟s precise serial number. The agents also

discovered that neither gun was manufactured in Maine, but both had been purchased from

Maine retail stores in the 1980s.

       As the Government points out, Ms. Reynolds cites no authority for the proposition that

police must obtain a search warrant before conducting forensic tests on evidence of crime

lawfully seized pursuant to the plain view doctrine.       In the Court‟s view, however, Ms.

Reynolds‟ position suffers from a greater infirmity—she assumes the forensic testing constituted

a search under the Fourth Amendment. It is well settled that “[b]efore embarking upon the

merits of a suppression challenge, a criminal defendant must show that he had a reasonable

expectation of privacy in the area searched and in relation to the items seized.” United States v.

Aguirre, 839 F.2d 854, 856 (1st Cir. 1988). In resolving the expectation question, courts apply a

two-part test, which involves “first, whether the movant has exhibited an actual, subjective,

expectation of privacy; and second, whether such subjective expectation is one that society is

prepared to recognize as objectively reasonable.” United States v. Rheault, No. 06-1978, 2009

U.S. App. LEXIS 6484, at *9 (1st Cir. Mar. 27, 2009). Several courts have observed that



                                               20
Case 1:07-cr-00086-JAW Document 69 Filed 04/21/09 Page 21 of 22                   PageID #: 160



viewing and recording a serial number on a firearm lawfully possessed by police is not a Fourth

Amendment search because such conduct does not compromise a privacy expectation that our

society is prepared to consider reasonable. See, e.g., United States v. Menon, 24 F.3d 550, 563

(3d Cir. 1994); United States v. Kinney, 953 F.2d 863, 866 (4th Cir. 1992); United States v.

Walsh, 791 F.2d 811, 816 (10th Cir. 1986). These courts generally analogize to the Supreme

Court‟s statement in Jacobsen that “[a] chemical test that merely discloses whether or not a

particular substance is cocaine does not compromise any legitimate interest in privacy.” 466

U.S. at 123. As the Third Circuit noted in Menon, typical application of the Jacobsen principle

“will be the revelation of serial numbers on a gun which require a database to identify but which

reveal no information beyond whether the gun is legal or illegal.” Menon, 24 F.3d at 563.

       Here, it is true that the serial number was not in plain view but was instead obliterated,

requiring magnetic and chemical analysis to divine. In the Court‟s view, however, Jacobsen

applies nonetheless. Forensic analysis revealed the serial number of the firearm, which had

previously been exposed to plain view and in which no one has a reasonable expectation of

privacy. Obliteration of a serial number, which itself is evidence of a crime under 18 U.S.C. §

922(k), does not make a Fourth Amendment difference, especially when the federal agents

already had probable cause to believe that Ms. Reynolds could not legally possess either firearm.

       Further, even if the forensic analysis was a search, the federal agents already were

lawfully in possession of the firearms and were treating them as items of evidence. As the

Government notes, the Supreme Court held in United States v. Edwards, 415 U.S. 800, 801-04

(1974), that police may seize an arrestee‟s clothing and search it for evidence of crime without

principle applies with equal force where officers lawfully obtained an item of evidentiary value

pursuant to the plain view exception to the warrant requirement. An item of evidence is an item

of evidence, and once an “item is held as evidence, it can be retained even after the defendant

gains his release and can be subjected to such examination or tests as will confirm or enhance its

evidentiary value.” LaFave § 5.3(b) n.73 (discussing Edwards).12

  In Arizona v. Hicks, the Supreme Court observed that “[i]t would be absurd to say that an object could lawfully be
seized and taken from the premises, but could not be moved for closer examination.” 480 U.S. 321, 326 (1987). In
essence, this is exactly what Ms. Reynolds is inviting the Court to say—that even if it was lawful for Officer Harris
to seize the guns, it was still unlawful for federal agents later to search for and discover the serial number that had
been obliterated. “Evidence legally obtained by one police agency may be made available to other such agencies
without a warrant, even for a use different from that for which it was originally taken.” United States v. Lester, 647
F.2d 869, 875 (8th Cir. 1981). From the Court‟s perspective, once any objection based on the transfer of custody is
obviated, Ms. Reynolds‟ argument, based on a claim of a privacy expectation in the serial number, must fail.
