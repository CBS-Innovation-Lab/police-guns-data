CRIMINAL ACTION NO. 12-CR-10253-RW2Z-1

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
V.

KHYRON JOLLEY

ORDER
January 8, 2021
ZOBEL, S.D.J.

Defendant pled guilty to firearm and drug offenses pursuant to a plea agreement
that included an agreed disposition of imprisonment for ten years and a period of
supervised release of three years pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. 11(c)(1)(C). The Court
imposed that sentence. Defendant has been in custody since his arrest on September
13, 2012. Because he is reaching the end of his imprisonment the Bureau of Prisons
(‘BOP’), on October 9, 2020, transferred him from USP Lee in Virginia to Coolidge
House, a residential reentry center in Boston, Massachusetts. His release date from the
latter institution is April 5, 2021. Nonetheless, he filed a motion for compassionate
release. A hearing was held on January 7, 2021.

A motion for compassionate release may be granted upon a determination that
there are “extraordinary and compelling reasons” to warrant a sentence reduction, 18

U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A), and after consideration of the sentencing factors set forth in 18

U.S.C. § 3553(a). Defendant suffers from asthma and alleges that the medical care at
Case 1:12-cr-10253-RWZ Document 147 Filed 01/08/21 Page 2 of 3

Coolidge House has been insufficient to treat his condition. He has been placed in
quarantine at least once because another inmate at Coolidge House tested positive for
COVID-19. He argues that his medical condition establishes an “extraordinary and
compelling reason” for sentence reduction because he is at greater risk for serious
complications from COVID-19 should he contract it at the residential reentry center.
Defendant also suggests that any additional quarantine period at Coolidge House would
jeopardize his employment and frustrate his ability to successfully reintegrate into the
community.

At the hearing on defendant's motion, the Court learned that the BOP had agreed
to release defendant to home confinement on December 6, 2020. The standard
conditions of the BOP’s home confinement program would allow Mr. Jolley to work, -
attend rehabilitation programming, and participate in leisurely activities so long as he
agrees to certain conditions, including electronic monitoring, until his release date on
April 5, 2021. Defendant rejected the proffered release initially because of the
electronic monitoring condition and instead filed the instant motion for compassionate
release.

While he withdrew his objection to the ankle bracelet at the hearing, defendant
continues to resist the BOP’s offer to release because he prefers supervision by the
Probation Department to that of the BOP. The former would reduce the time of
supervision by three months as he would start the three-year period of supervision
immediately. Defendant also expresses concern that the consequences of a violation of
the terms of release may be more onerous under the BOP rules. These realities, even

if they impact defendant's release in different ways do not establish any basis for
Case 1:12-cr-10253-RWZ Document 147 Filed 01/08/21 Page 3 of 3

immediate release, let alone an extraordinary and compelling reason to warrant the

exceptional remedy he seeks.

The Motion for Compassionate Release (Docket # 143) is DENIED.
