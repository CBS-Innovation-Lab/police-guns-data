STATEMENT OF REASONS

VII COURT DETERMINATI()NS [)F RESTITUTION

A m Restitution Not Applicable.

B Total Amount of Restitutior:

 

C Restitution not ordered (Ch: ek only one.):

l l:l For offenses for whici restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

2 m For offenses for whici restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex

issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degre<
that the need to provic e restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.CA § 3663A(c):3)(13).

3 l:| For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not

ordered because the c mplication and prolongation ofthe sentencing process resulting from the fashioning ofa restitution order outweigh
the need to provide re titution to any victims under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(l)(B)(ii).

4 l___l Restitution is not ordered for other reasons. (Explain.)

D l:l Partial restitution is ordered for these reasons (18 U.S.C. § 3553(c)):
