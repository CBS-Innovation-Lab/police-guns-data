MEMORANDUM & ORDER

GORTON, J.

I. Background

On December 6, 2007, Enrique Agosto (“Agosto” or “petitioner”)
pled guilty to a single-count charge of conspiracy to distribute
heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 846 and 841(a)(1). ln the
written plea agreement, the parties mistakenly calculated the
guideline range for Agosto as 188 to 235 months imprisonment,
when, in fact, it was 262 to 327 months. This Court acknowledged
their mistake at sentencing on March 6, 2008, but nonetheless
accepted the original plea agreement and sentenced Agosto to 188
months in prison, the low end of the (incorrect) guideline range
agreed upon by the parties. Agosto is currently serving that
sentence.

Agosto filed a motion to vacate, set aside or correct his
sentence (“the motion to vacate”) on September 25, 2009, pursuant

to 28 U.S.C. § 2255. He challenged his conviction and sentence

_l.._

on the grounds that trial counsel was ineffective in that he

1) failed to file a timely notice of appeal (“Claim 1”),

2) failed to move for a downward departure at sentencing based on
the argument that Agosto's career offender designation overstated
the seriousness of his criminal history (“Claim 2”), 3) advised
Agosto to accept the plea agreement and told Agosto that if he
went to trial he would be sentenced to life in prison (“Claim 3”)
and 4) failed at sentencing to seek an adjustment for Agosto's
minor role in the offense (“Claim 4”). His motion to vacate was
referred to Magistrate Judge Robert Collings for a Report and
Recommendation (“R&R”).

On May 11, 2012, Magistrate Judge Collings issued an R&R
recommending that the motion to vacate be denied, concluding that
Claims 2 and 4 are procedurally barred and Claims 1 and 3 are
without merit. This Court finds the R&R well-reasoned and, after
consideration of petitioner's objection thereto, will accept and
adopt it in its entirety. The Court writes separately to address
whether a certificate of appealability should issue with respect
to any of Agosto's claims.

II. Analysis

A. Standard

Section 2253(c) of Title 28 of the United States Code
provides that a Certificate of Appealability may issue “only if

the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a

__2_

constitutional right.” 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2). In order to make

l

a “substantial showing,' a petitioner seeking a certificate of

appealability must demonstrate that

reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that
matter, agree that) the petition should have been
resolved in a different manner or that the issues
presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to
proceed further.

Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000). The debatable-among

 

jurists-of-reason standard is a low barrier. A claim is
considered “debatable” even if every reasonable jurist would
agree that the petitioner will not prevail. Miller-El v.
Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 338 (2003). The petitioner must,
however, prove “something more than the absence of frivolity or
the existence of mere good faith.” ld; When a habeas petition
contains more than one potential ground for relief, a court must
state which issues, if any, satisfy the standard set forth in the
statute. 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2)-(3).

B. Application

Even under the lenient standard articulated above, a
certificate of appealability is unwarranted with respect to
Claims 2, 3 or 4. As Magistrate Judge Collings recognized,
Claims 2 and 4 are “garden~variety” claims plainly barred by the
waiver of appellate rights agreed to by Agosto in the plea
agreement. As for Claim 3, even if Agosto could establish that

his attorney was constitutionally ineffective for advising him to

 

accept the plea agreement and telling him that if he went to
trial he would be sentenced to life imprisonment, no reasonable
jurist would conclude from the record that Agosto would have
insisted on going to trial had he been capably advised. By
pleading guilty, Agosto received not only a three-point reduction
in his offense level but also the benefit of a sentence that was
incorrectly calculated in his favor. There is also little
indication that he would have had a plausible defense.

In contrast, Claim l presents at a colorable claim for
relief, albeit one not persuasive to this Court. In fact,
whether counsel is constitutionally ineffective for failing to
abide by his client's request to file a timely appeal after his
client has already signed a plea agreement is an issue on which
the circuit courts of appeals are divided. Compare Campbell v.
United States, No. 11~3233, 2012 WL 2923492 (6th Cir. Jul. 19,
2012) (holding that the failure to perfect a direct appeal at the
defendant's request is a per §§ Sixth Amendment violation);
United States v. Poindexter, 492 F.3d 263 (4th Cir. 2007); Qgited
States v. Iapp, 491 F.3d 263 (5th Cir. 2007); Watson v. United
States, 493 F.3d 960 (8th Cir. 2007); Qampu§ang v. Qnited_§t§te§,

442 F.3d 770 (2d Cir. 2006); United States v. Sandoval-Lopez, 409

 

F.3d 1193 (9th Cir. 2005); United States v. Garrett, 402 F.3d

1262(10th Cir. 2005); Gomes-Diaz v. United States, 433 F.3d 788

 

(11th Cir. 2006), with Nunez v. United States, 546 F.3d 450 (7th

Cir. 2008) (holding that if a defendant waives his right to appeal
pursuant to a plea agreement, “counsel should protect the client’s
interest in retaining the benefit of the plea bargain,” even if
that means ignoring a client’s express instruction to appeal);
United States v. Mab;y, 536 F.3d 231 (3d Cir. 2005). The First
Circuit is the only circuit court not to have opined on the
issue. Should Agosto appeal, it will be afforded the opportunity
to do so.

ORDER

In light of the foregoing,

l) the Report and Recommendation (Docket No. 574) is hereby
ACCEPTED and ADOPTED;

2) the motion to vacate (Docket No. 495) is DENIED;

3) a certificate of appealability will issue with respect to
Claim 1 (ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to
file a timely notice of appeal); and

4) certificates of appealability will not issue with respect
to Claim 2 (ineffective assistance of counsel for failure
to move for a downward departure at sentencing on the
ground that the career offender designation overstated
the seriousness of petitioner’s criminal history), Claim
3 (ineffective assistance of counsel for advising
petitioner to accept the plea agreement and telling
petitioner that if he went to trial he would be sentenced
to life imprisonment); and Claim 4 (ineffective
assistance of counsel for failure to seek an adjustment
for petitioner’s role in the offense).

So ordered. %MWM£O$:
