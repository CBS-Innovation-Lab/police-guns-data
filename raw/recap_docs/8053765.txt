                         UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                     FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND


CHRISTOPHER LOM,                                   CA NO. 08-16T

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA


                  NOTICE OF MOTION FOR AN ORDER GRANTING
                         CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY


    Movant, Christopher Lom,      ~      se and in forma pauperis, hereby submits
this Motion for An Order Granting Certificate of Appealability pursuant to
28 U.S.C.     §   2253   (c)(1)(B),    and   Rule 22(b}       of the Federal    Rules of
Appellate Procedure,      limited to the following Ground, and further states:


                           PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
    To obtain a Certificate of Appealability (COA) under 2253(c}, a habeas
petitioner   must   make a    substanial     rational    showing   of the denial      of a
constitutional right, a demonstration that includes a showing that reasonable
jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition
should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented
were "adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further. II                Slack      v.
McDaniel, Warden, et aI., 529 U.S. 473, 483-484 (2000) (citations omitted).
The petitioner has been adjudged by this court to have committed a felony
but sentenced him to that of a misdemeanor sentence under the Sentencing
Reform Act of 1984 which is a denial of due process of law.


                                      GROUND ONE
   WHETHER JURISTS OR REASON WOULD FIND THE DISTRICT COURT'S
ASSESSMENT THAT THE DETERMI NATION AS TO WHETHER AN OFFENSE
IS A FELONY IS BASED ON WHETHER THE OFFENSE IS PUNISHABLE BY
A TERM OF IMPRISONMENT EXCEEDING ONE YEAR AND NOT ON THE
LENGTH OF THE SENTENCE ACTUALLY IMPOSED OR CALLED FOR BY THE
GUIDELINES, DEBATABLE OR WRONG.

MATERIAL FACT:               The movant was sentenced pursuant to the Sentencing
Reform Act of 1984 for violating 18 U. S. C. § 922 (k).                     Section    922 (k)    dictates
the statutory maximum to be five years.


THE LAW:          Once the sentencing guidelines took effect, Congress intended
the statutory maximum sentences prescribed in 18 U.S.C. § 3581{b), ... ,
to represent lithe greatest period the Congress should allow a judge to
impose for an offense committed under the most egregious of circumstances. II
United    States     v.      R.L.C.,    915    F.2d   320,   324 (8th Cir , 1990)          (internal
citations omitted) cert. granted, aff'd, 503 U. S. 291, 307 (1992).                       Certiorari
was granted to resolve the conflict between the Eighth Circuit's holding and
the Ninth Circuit's position, adopted in United States v. Marco L., 868 F. 2d
1121,     cert.    den , ,    493   U.S.      956   (1989)   which   was       endorsed      by     the
Government. See R.L.C., 503 U.S. at 296-297.


    The Supreme Court affirmed the Eighth Circuit's holding that under the
Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, the Guidelines establish the maximum term
of imprisonment with the ceiling to be the statute of conviction.                           R. L. C.,
915 F.2d at 323-324.


THE FACTS AND LAW AS APPLIED TO MOVANT:                                     The Court's position
mimic's    the     Government's        position     under    Marco   L. ,     supra,     which      was
overruled by the Supreme Court of the United States. See United States v.
R.L.C., 915 F.2d 325-326 n.3 ("Section 3559{b) was not meant to function
as an overarching definition of "maximum term of imprisonment" for the
entire federal criminal code.") aff'd 503 U.S. 291, 307 (1992).


    Had the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (Pub .L. 98-473, S.Rep 98-225,
pp. 3297) not been in effect at the time of movant's sentencing, the district
court's logic is not debatable.               However, the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984
is still in full force and effect.


    18 U.S.C. §3559{a){5) provides that the movant be convicted of a felony
if he was imprisoned for less than five years but more than one year.
§3559 (6) specifically provide a sentence one year or less but more than six

months, as a Class A misdemeanor. See 18 U.S.C. §3559(a)(6).


    The district court abused its discretion in denying movant habeas relief.
Felony sentences are meted out at a bare minimum, a year and a day of
imprisonment as outlined by federal law. See 18 U.S.C. §3559(a)(5).


    The     maximum        term     of     imprisonment      authorized      under     18    U.S.C.
§3581 (b) (6)   is    not more than one year without any enhancements being
applied.    However, if there were aggravating factors that required movant
to be judicially enhanced, the maximum term of punishment, when piling on
sentence-elevating         aggravating       facts   would    be    capped    by   the      statutory
maximum of 18 U.S.C. § 922(k) which is five years.


    Wherefore        the   movant        prays   this   court      grant him a       certificate of
applicability (COA).
