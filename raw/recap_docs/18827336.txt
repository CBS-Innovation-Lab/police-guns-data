               IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

     Plaintiff,

                v.                      CRIMINAL NO. 12-555 (FAB)

JOSE LUIS AVILES-VEGA [1],
RICARDO JAVIER RIVERA-RUIZ [2],

     Defendants.


                       MEMORANDUM AND ORDER

BESOSA, District Judge.

     A district court may refer a pending motion to suppress to a

magistrate judge for a report and recommendation.          See 28 U.S.C.

§ 636(b)(1)(B); Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b); Loc. Rule 72(b).           Any party

adversely affected by the report and recommendation may file

written objections within fourteen days of being served with the

magistrate judge’s report.    See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1).      A party who

files a timely objection is entitled to a de novo determination of

“those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or

recommendations to which specific objection is made.”            Sylva v.

Culebra Dive Shop, 389 F.Supp.2d 189, 191-92 (D.P.R. 2005) (citing

United States v. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667, 673 (1980)).          Failure to

comply with this rule precludes further review.            See Davet v.

Maccorone, 973 F.2d 22, 30-31 (1st Cir. 1992).        In conducting its

review, the court is free to “accept, reject, or modify, in whole
         Case 3:12-cr-00555-FAB Document 88 Filed 01/28/13 Page 2 of 3



Civil No. 12-555 (FAB)                                                               2

or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate

judge.” 28 U.S.C. § 636 (a)(b)(1); Templeman v. Chris Craft Corp.,

770 F.2d 245, 247 (1st Cir. 1985); Alamo Rodriguez v. Pfizer

Pharmaceuticals,      Inc.,    286   F.Supp.2d       144,    146   (D.P.R.    2003).

Furthermore, the Court may accept those parts of the report and

recommendation       to    which    the    parties      do   not    object.        See

Hernandez-Mejias v. General Elec., 428 F.Supp.2d 4, 6 (D.P.R. 2005)

(citing    Lacedra    v.    Donald    W.   Wyatt       Detention    Facility,      334

F.Supp.2d 114, 125-126 (D.R.I. 2004)).

     On January 8, 2013, the United States magistrate judge issued

a   thorough,      well-analyzed          and    comprehensive        Report       and

Recommendation (“R&R”) (Docket No. 84), recommending that defendant

Aviles-Vega’s     motion     to    suppress     (Docket      No.   38),   joined    by

defendant Rivera-Ruiz (Docket Nos. 41 and 44), be DENIED.                          On

January 21, 2013 defendant Aviles-Vega filed his objection to the

Report    and   Recommendation       (Docket     No.    85).       That   same   day,

defendant Rivera-Ruiz joined defendant Aviles-Vega’s objections

(Docket No. 86), and the Court granted the request for joinder

(Docket No. 87).

     The Court has made an independent examination of the entire

record in this case, including defendants’ objections, and ADOPTS1

the magistrate judge’s findings and recommendations.

     Accordingly,      defendant    Aviles-Vega’s     motion   to   suppress

(Docket No. 38), joined by defendant Rivera-Ruiz (Docket Nos. 41

and 44) is DENIED.

     IT IS SO ORDERED.

     1
       Although the Court adopts the magistrate judge’s Report and
Recommendation, it does not agree that “this case presents a close
question.” (R&R, Docket No. 84, p. 1). The Court has read Florida
v. J.L., 529 U.S. 266 (2000), and cases decided after it. This
case is quite distinguishable from J.L. and more akin to those
cases where the tip was based on an informant’s first-hand and
recent observation (as opposed to an anonymous telephone tip) which
was held to have sufficient indices of reliability to support a
determination of reasonable suspicion. E.g., U.S. v. Copening, 506
F.3d, 1241 (10th Cir. 2007); U.S. v. Valentine, 232 F.2d 350 (3d
Cir. 2000). Additionally, the police were sufficiently careful to
corroborate the information received about the vehicle involved,
which turned out to be accurate.
