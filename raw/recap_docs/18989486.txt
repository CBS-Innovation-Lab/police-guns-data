                     UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                          DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

                v.                           Case No. 11-cr-137-01-SM

Rafael A. Corniel


                                    ORDER

      Defendant Corniel’s motion to continue the final pretrial conference and

trial is granted (document no. 9). Trial has been rescheduled for the January

2012 trial period. Defendant Corniel shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights not

later than November 4, 2011. On the filing of such waiver, his continuance shall

be effective.

      The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18

U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would

unreasonably deny defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances.

      Final Pretrial Conference is rescheduled for January 6, 2012 at

9:30 a.m.
