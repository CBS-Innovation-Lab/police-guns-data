          STATUS REPORT IN RESPONSE TO ORDER OF APRIL 4, 2013

     The parties and United States Probation have conferred as

required by the Court’s Order of April 4, 2013 and hereby report

to the Court as follows:

     1. The Motion to Vacate

     The government has reviewed the facts of this case and based

on the involvement of Annie Dookhan, the absence of any untested

drugs, and other surrounding circumstances, does not oppose that

Motion to Vacate and the entry of an order vacating the June 6,

2009 Judgment of Conviction.

     2.    Pending Supervised Release Revocation Matters

     The government has consulted with Probation regarding the

impact of the allowance of the Motion to Vacate on any pending

supervised release revocation matters.      Both the government and

Probation believe that, upon allowance of the Motion to Vacate,

all supervised release matters should be dismissed as well.           The
     Case 1:07-cr-10289-MLW Document 135 Filed 04/08/13 Page 2 of 3



defendant does not object to the dismissal of these matters.

     In view of the foregoing, the parties believe that it is

unnecessary for the Court to conduct the hearing scheduled for

April 15 and jointly request (with Probation’s assent) that the

hearing be cancelled.

                                 Respectfully submitted,
