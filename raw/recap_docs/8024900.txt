               GOVERNMENT’S OBJECTION TO DEFENDANT’S
     MOTION FOR REDUCTION OF SENTENCE PURSUANT TO 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2)


                                        INTRODUCTION

        The Defendant, KEITH WARE, (“Defendant”), has travelled in a long and procedurally

abusive path of post conviction litigation. In this, at least his sixth attempt, Defendant

apparently, but not clearly, complains about a purported miscalculation of the sentencing

guidelines which he attributes to “double counting” that occurred at his sentencing hearing more

than twelve years ago. The United States objects and requests that the motion be denied and

dismissed.

                                         BACKGROUND

        In September, 1994, a federal grand jury returned an indictment against Defendant

charging him with being a felon in possession of a firearm. See generally United States v. Ware,

No. 94-cr-00069 (D.R.I. Judgement, June 26,1995). The indictment stemmed from events that



                                                   1
       Case 1:94-cr-00069-T         Document 44         Filed 01/29/2008       Page 2 of 10



occurred on July 9, 1994, in which Defendant drew a semi-automatic pistol and fired shots at two

unarmed individuals over a debt. Id. After a jury trial before United State District Court Judge

Ernest C. Torres, Defendant was sentenced in June of 1995 to 25 years in prison. Id. Defendant

made no objection to the Pre-Sentence Report. Id. Defendant then filed a notice of appeal.

       After several extensions of time and a change in counsel, defendant’s counsel then filed a

motion to withdraw as counsel accompanied by a brief pursuant to Anders v. State of Cal., 386

U.S. 738 (1967). Appellant’s Anders Brief, United States v. Ware, No. 95-1732 (1st Cir. 1997).

Pursuant to Anders:

       [I]f counsel finds his case to be wholly frivolous, after a conscientious
       examination of it, he should so advise the court and request permission to
       withdraw. That request must, however, be accompanied by a brief referring to
       anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal. A copy of counsel's
       brief should be furnished the indigent and time allowed him to raise any points
       that he chooses; the court-not counsel-then proceeds, after a full examination of
       all the proceedings, to decide whether the case is wholly frivolous. If it so finds it
       may grant counsel's request to withdraw and dismiss the appeal . . . .

Anders, 386 U.S. 744.

        In his Anders brief, defense counsel identified two issues to be presented: (1) Whether

the District Court Erred in Denying Appellant’s Rule 29 motion; and (2) Whether Appellant’s

Sixth Amendment Right to Counsel was violated by trial counsel’s ineffectiveness? Appellant’s

Anders Brief at 13. As to both issues, he submitted that the answer should be in the negative. Id.

Consistent with Anders Defendant was given the opportunity to submit a brief of his own, but

did not. Order, United States v. Ware, No. 95-1732 (1st Cir. 1997). After a full examination of

the proceedings, the First Circuit Court of Appeals granted the motion to withdraw and affirmed

Defendant’s conviction. Id.

       In 1998, Defendant filed a petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255, charging that his trial

counsel was ineffective because he stipulated that Defendant had previously been convicted of a

felony. See generally Ware v. United States, No. 98-cv-00408 (D.R.I. 2001). The district court

rejected Defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Id. Defendant then filed a motion

pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59(e), requesting that the court alter or amend its

decision. Id. In this motion, Defendant raised additional ineffective assistance of counsel

claims. Id. The district court denied this motion and denied Defendant’s subsequent motion for

a certificate of appealability. Id. Defendant then asked the First Circuit Court of Appeals to

issue a certificate of appealability. See generally Ware v. United States, No. 99-2234 (1st Cir.

April 12, 2001). This motion was denied and the appeal was terminated. Id. In its order, the

Court of Appeals further stated that:

       [E]ven if we were to treat the present appeal as an application for permission to
       file a second or successive petition, we would deny it. Congress has limited
       second petitions to those based on either “newly discovered evidence” . . . or “a
       new rule of constitutional law made retroactive . . .’”

Order at 2, Ware v. United States, No. 99-2234 (1st Cir. April 12, 2001).

       In August, 2005, Defendant sought leave from the First Circuit Court of Appeals to file a

second or successive petition in order to pursue a claim pursuant to Shepard v. United States, 125

S.Ct. 1254 (2005). See generally Ware v. United States, No. 05-2267 (1st Cir. September 15,

2005). On September 15, 2005, the First Circuit entered an order denying Defendant’s

application without prejudice because the Supreme Court’s ruling in Shepard was not retroactive.

Id.

       In August 2007, Defendant filed a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254. See generally



                                                 3
       Case 1:94-cr-00069-T           Document 44       Filed 01/29/2008        Page 4 of 10



Ware v. Minor, No. 07-cv-00317 (D.R.I. October 30, 2007). In October, 2007, United States

District Court Judge Torres entered an order adopting Magistrate Judge David L. Martin’s

recommendation that Defendant’s petition be dismissed without prejudice to the Petitioner

refiling, if and when, he obtains permission from the Court of Appeals to file a second or

successive petition. Id. The Magistrate Judge’s recommendation found that the Court: (1)

lacked jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C § 2254, because Defendant was a federal, not a state,

prisoner; (2) lacked jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 because Defendant had not obtained

certification from the First Circuit to file a second or successive petition; and (3) lacked

jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1651 pursuant to United States v. Barrett, 178 F.3d 34, 38 (1st Cir.

1999), which held that a prisoner cannot evade the restrictions of 28 U.S.C. § 2255 by filing a

habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254 or the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651. Id.

       In October, 2007, Defendant filed a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 seeking the

same relief sought in his petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254. See generally Ware v. Martinez,

No. 07-cv-00392 (D.R.I. November 11, 2007). On October 25, 2007, Magistrate Judge Lincoln

Almond entered a Report and Recommendation in which he concurred with Magistrate Judge

Martin’s report in Ware v. Minor, No. 07-cv-00317 (D.R.I. October 30, 2007), and incorporated

Magistrate Judge Martin’s Report and Recommendation by reference. Id. Chief United States

District Court Judge Mary M. Lisi accepted the recommendation and dismissed Defendant’s third

habeas petition with prejudice. Id.

       Now, more than a decade after he was sentenced, Defendant files this motion asking the

Court to correct an error in his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2). Defendant contends

his sentence was improperly calculated and seemingly attempts to rely on Amendment 599 to the


                                                  4
       Case 1:94-cr-00069-T        Document 44         Filed 01/29/2008       Page 5 of 10



November 1, 2004, United States Sentencing Guidelines to support his argument, at least by

analogy. See generally Petition. He is asking the Court to correct his sentence to Offense Level

28, Criminal History VI for a sentencing range of 140 - 175 months. Id. at 3. The Government

objects and asks that Defendant’s motion be dismissed for the following reasons.

                                          ARGUMENT

I.     18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) IS NOT APPLICABLE BECAUSE THE RELEVANT
       GUIDELINE RANGE HAS NOT BEEN AMENDED.

       Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2):

       The court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed
       except that–
                                                 ...
       (2) in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment
       based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing
       Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the
       Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the
       term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to
       the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable
       policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.

18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).

       This exception “permits a court to modify a sentence once imposed if the Sentencing

Commission later changes the applicable guidelines reducing the term of imprisonment.

The court may modify the sentence, however, only if doing so ‘is consistent with applicable

policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.’” United States v. Havener, 905 F. 2d

3, 7 (1st. Cir. 1990) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2)) (emphasis added).

       In his petition, Defendant attempts to claim that Amendment 599 to the United States

Sentencing Guidelines effective November 1, 2000, somehow supports his claim that the court

used impermissible double counting in calculating his sentence. Petition at 5-7. This argument


                                                 5
         Case 1:94-cr-00069-T       Document 44         Filed 01/29/2008       Page 6 of 10



must fail.

         The probation officer calculated defendant’s offense level using §§ 2K2.1(a)(2) and

4B1.4 of the Sentencing Guidelines. PSR at 4-5. Amendment 599 to the United States

Sentencing Guidelines affects § 2K2.4. USSG, App. C, Amend. 599 (Nov. 1, 2000). § 2K2.4

pertains to statutory provisions 18 U.S.C. §§ 844(h), 924(c), and 929(a). Defendant was

convicted of an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g), for possession of a weapon by a convicted

felon. Amendment 599 does not effect Defendant’s sentence. Therefore, the sentencing range

for which Defendant was convicted has not been lowered and 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) does not

apply.

II.      DEFENDANT’S ARGUMENT THAT HIS BASE OFFENSE LEVEL WAS
         IMPROPERLY ENHANCED IS MOOT.

         Defendant was convicted for Possession of a Weapon by a Convicted Felon pursuant to

18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), a Class C felony. PRS at 1. The United States Sentencing Guidelines

Manual effective November 1, 1994, was used to calculate Defendant’s sentence consistent with

the policy to use the guidelines manual that was in effect at the time of sentencing. Id. at 4.

         The guideline for a Title 18, Section 922(g) offense is found in 2K2.1 of the Sentencing

Guidelines. PSR at 4-5; USSG, § 2K2.1 (November 1, 1994); United States v. Gary, 74 F.3d

304, 315 (1st Cir. 1996) . Since Defendant had two prior felony convictions, his base level

offense was twenty-four (24). Id. According to 2K2.1(b)(5), if a defendant used or possessed

any firearm in connection with another felony offense, the offense level is to be increased by four

(4) levels. Id. In addition to his federal charges, Defendant was facing state court charges as a

result of the events that occurred on July 9, 1994. PSR at 5. Those charges included Assault



                                                  6
       Case 1:94-cr-00069-T         Document 44         Filed 01/29/2008       Page 7 of 10



with a Dangerous Weapon and Carrying Firearms While Committing a Crime of Violence. Id.1

Thus, Defendant’s offense level was increased by four (4) levels to twenty-eight (28) because he

fired the gun at two people. PSR at 5, USSG, § 2K2.1 (November 1, 1994); Gary, 74 F.3d at

315.

       Defendant also had three (3) prior convictions for crimes of violence, which made him

subject to sentence enhancement under the Armed Career Criminal Act (“ACCA”), 18 U.S.C. §

924(e). According to§ 4B1.4 of the Sentencing Manual, the applicable level for a defendant who

used or possessed the firearm for which he was found guilty of possessing, in connection with a

crime of violence, is thirty-four (34). PSR, at. 5, USSG § 4B1.2(1); Gary, 74 F.3d 316.

       Specifically, § 4B1.4 states that the offense level for an armed career criminal is the

“greatest of (1) the offense level applicable from Chapters Two and Three; or . . . (3) (A) 34, if

the defendant used or possessed the firearm or ammunition in connection with a crime of

violence or controlled substance offense, as defined in 4B1.2(1). . . .” USSG, § 4B1.4

(November 1, 1994)(emphasis added.) The offense level calculated based on § 2K2.1, felon in

possession of a weapon, was twenty-eight (28). PSR at. 4-5. The offense level calculated based

on § 4B1.4 was thirty-four (34). Id. at 5. Since the greatest of the two calculations is thirty-four

(34), Defendant’s offense level was properly calculated.

       Therefore, even if Defendant were able to get four (4) levels removed from the Offense

Level twenty-eight (28) which was determined pursuant to § 2K2.1, the greater of the two

calculations would be thirty-four (34) pursuant to § 4B1.4, making Defendant’s claim that his

       1
       On November 6, 1996, Defendant plead guilty to Carrying a Pistol Without a License,
Felony Assault with a Dangerous Weapon, and Conspiracy. See Providence County Superior
Court Case No. P2-1994-3226AG.

                                                  7
       Case 1:94-cr-00069-T         Document 44        Filed 01/29/2008       Page 8 of 10



sentence was improperly enhanced moot.

III.   DEFENDANT’S MOTION IS MERELY ANOTHER ATTEMPT AT
       CIRCUMVENTING 28 U.S.C. § 2255 AND THEREFORE MUST BE DENIED.

       Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §2255:

       A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress
       claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in
       violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was
       without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of
       the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may
       move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the
       sentence.

28 U.S.C. § 2255.

       Furthermore, the statute limits the number of petitions that can be filed pursuant to 28

U.S.C. § 2255.

       A second or successive motion must be certified as provided in section 2244 by a
       panel of the appropriate court of appeals to contain–
       (1) newly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence
       as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that
       no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense; or
       (2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review
       by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.

Id.

       Since 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) is clearly not applicable to Defendant’s petition, it can only

be construed as another attempt at challenging his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.

However, this option is not available to defendant. United States v. Cabrera-Polo, 376 F.3d 29,

31 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing Sepulveda v. United States, 330 F.3d 55, 66 (1st Cir.2003) (noting

restrictions on the bringing of “second or successive” section 2255 motions)). Defendant filed a

petition pursuant to § 2255 in 1998. The First Circuit upheld the district court’s denial of his



                                                 8
       Case 1:94-cr-00069-T         Document 44         Filed 01/29/2008        Page 9 of 10



petition stating that even if it were to construe his appeal as permission for a second or

successive petition, he did not meet criteria set out by 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Furthermore, in August

2005, Defendant petitioned the Court of Appeals for permission to file a second or successive

petition which was denied. In further attempts to reduce his sentence, Defendant filed petitions

pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2254 and 2241, both of which were construed as attempts to circumvent

the restrictions of § 2255, and therefore, were denied absent consent from the Court of Appeals.



                                         CONCLUSION

       Based on the foregoing, the United States moves this Honorable Court to deny

Defendant’s Motion for Reduction of Sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2).
