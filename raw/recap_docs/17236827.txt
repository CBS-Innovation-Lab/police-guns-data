STATEMENT OF REASONS
VII COURT DETERMINATIONS OF RESTITUTION
A {Zl Restitution Not Applicable.
B Total Amount of Restitution:
C Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):
l [:l l~`or offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. §3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S.C. §3663A(c)(3)(/\)
2 m For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U S.C, § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex

issues offact and relating them to the cause or amount ofthe victims` losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(B)

3 [:l For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not

ordered because the complication and prolongation ofthe sentencing process resulting from the fashioning ofa restitution order outweigh

the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U.S.C. §3663(a)(1)(B)(ii).

4 l:l Restitution is not ordered for other reasons (Exp|ain.)
