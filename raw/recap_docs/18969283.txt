                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                        DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                                   Criminal No. 10-cr-032-01-JD

Megann Glidden


                                  O R D E R


     On February 24, 2011, the defendant appeared for a bail

revocation hearing pursuant to 18 U.S.C. ' 3148.

     The background is as follows: Defendant is charged with

Conspiracy to Make a False Statement to Licensee in violation of

18 U.S.C. §§ 371 and 922(a)(6); "Straw Purchase" of Firearm (2

counts) in violation of 18 U.S.C. ' 922(a)(6); and Possession of

a Firearm by an Unlawful User of Controlled Substance in

violation of 18 U.S.C. ' 922(g)(3).          On April 15, 2010, defendant

was released on bail following her initial appearance in this

court.    On November 8, 2010, defendant entered a plea of guilty.

Defendant was released on the same bail conditions as originally

ordered.     Sentencing is currently scheduled for March 24, 2011.

     The government alleges that since defendant's release on

bail in November, she has tested positive for amphetamines on

two separate occasions (January 31 and February 9, 2011); failed
       Case 1:10-cr-00032-JD Document 52 Filed 02/24/11 Page 2 of 4




to call in for drug test reporting instructions on twenty-six

(26) occasions; failed to submit to drug testing on nine (9)

occasions; and failed to attend a scheduled substance abuse

counseling session on February 16, 2011.        The Office of

Probation and Pretrial Services maintains that this conduct

violates conditions of bail as set forth in the report dated

February 22, 2011.

    A request to revoke bail is governed by 18 U.S.C. ' 3148,

which provides in part:

    The judicial officer shall enter an order of
    revocation and detention if, after a hearing, the
    judicial officer--

    (1) finds that there is-

          (A) probable cause to believe that the person has
          committed a Federal, State, or local crime while
          on release; or

          (B) clear and convincing evidence that the person
          has violated any other condition of release; and

    (2) finds that--

          (A) based on the factors set forth in section
          3142(g) of this title, there is no condition or
          combination of conditions of release that will
          assure that the person will not flee or pose a
          danger to the safety of any other person or the
          community; or

          (B) the person is unlikely to abide by any
          condition or combination of conditions of
          release.

18 U.S.C. ' 3148 (b)(1)-(2).     The government has the initial

burden to establish the violation under 18 U.S.C. ' 3148 (b)(1).

If the government establishes probable cause to believe the

defendant committed a new "felony" offense on release, a

rebuttable presumption arises that no condition or combination

of conditions will assure that the person will not pose a danger

to the safety of any other person or the community.          18 U.S.C. '

3148(b)(2).   Otherwise, the government typically has the burden

to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the requirements of

section 3148 (b)(2)(A) or (B).      Aron, 904 F.2d at 224; United

States v. Poinsett, 953 F. Supp. 37, 38 (N.D.N.Y. 1997).

     In this case, defendant conceded that the government had

sufficient evidence to establish probable cause that defendant

violated the conditions of her bail as charged.         Thus, the only

question before the court was whether to release the defendant.

For all of the reasons stated on the record, the court finds

that defendant is unlikely to abide by any conditions or

combination of conditions of release.       Therefore, the conditions

of release are revoked.

     Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the defendant be detained.

The defendant is committed to the custody of the Attorney

General or his designated representative for confinement in a

corrections facility separate, to the extent practicable, from

persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody

pending appeal.     The defendant shall be afforded a reasonable

opportunity for private consultation with defense counsel.             On

order of a court of the United States or on request of an

attorney for the government, the person in charge of the

corrections facility shall deliver the defendant to the United

States Marshal for the purpose of an appearance in connection

with a court proceeding.

      SO ORDERED.
