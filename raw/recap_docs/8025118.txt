       GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO PETITIONER'S MOTION
   FOR RELIEF OF JUDGMENT DENYING PETITIONER'S INITIAL $2255
   PURSUANT TO RULE 60(b)(6), FEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE


   The petitioner, Jose Genao (Genao or Petitioner), files this motion, pursuant to Fed.

R. Civ. P. 60(b), presumably to vacate the Court's Order entered on June 2,2004 denying

his motion filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 9 2255. Genao suggests the Court failed to

address his original 4 2255, and reiterates several of the claims raised in his original   4
2255. Additionally, Genao asks the Court to vacate his sentence of 262 months

imprisonment pursuant to the Supreme Court's ruling in United States v. Booker, 543

U.S. 220 (2005).

I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

    On August 3 1, 2000, this Court sentenced petitioner to 262 months of imprisonment

for his conviction for possession with intent to distribute heroin, possession of

ammunition by a convicted felon and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.

Judgment was entered on September 5,2000. Petitioner appealed to the United States

Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. His appeal was denied on February 27, 2000.

Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court.

His petition before the Supreme Court was denied on October 7,2002. Petitioner filed

his original petition with this Court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 5 2255, on October 6,2003

(the "original petition") within one year of the denial of his petition for writ of certiorari

by the Supreme Court. Petitioner then filed a motion to supplement the original petition

on March 15, 2004. This Court denied both the original petition as well as the motion to

supplement in a Court Order on June 2, 2004. Petitioner has now filed the instant motion

with this Court on May 11, 2006. The motion sets forth no new claims but reiterates

several of the claims contained in the original tj 2255 petition as well as the motion to

supplement. In addition, Genao now asserts his sentence should be vacated pursuant to

Booker.
P




11. ARGUMENT

    Genao's motion must be treated as a successive petition pursuant to tj 2255.

Munoz v. United States, 331 F.3d 151, 152 (1st Cir. 2003) (when a motion under Rule

60(b) directly challenges constitutional issues of a habeas petitioner's underlying

conviction it should be treated as a successive 5 2255). Thus, merely because he

captioned his petition pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6) does not obviate Genao's need to obtain

permission from the First Circuit to file a successive 6 2255. He has failed to do so.

    Genao raises five claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, a Fifth Amendment

violation of protection against self-incrimination, a double jeopardy claim based on a

state case where he was allegedly charged with the same crime, and a claim that the

sentence be vacated or adjusted due to the Supreme Court ruling in Booker.

    The claims made by Genao of ineffective assistance of counsel as well as the self-

incrimination claim and the double jeopardy claim were all raised in the original petition
     Case 1:99-cr-00105-L        Document 88         Filed 06/21/2006      Page 3 of 4



on October 6,2003, see C.A. No. 03-461, and were denied and dismissed for those

reasons stated in the Court's Order, parts I1 B and C (attached at A). This successive fj

2255 reiterates those claims, and should be denied due to, among other reasons, lack of

jurisdiction for a successive petition and being barred by the statute of limitations. 28

U.S.C. 5 2255. Genao has also failed to obtain an order from the Circuit Court

authorizing the District Court to consider his petition, as required under 28 U.S.C. fj



    To the extent that Genao asserts that his motion should be granted due to

the ruling in Booker, his argument is also meritless. The relevant part of ยง 2255 states:

    A second or successive motion must be certified as provided in section
     e
     ,.
    ~ ~ by4a panel of the appropriate court of appeals to coniain-
          4   4

              4


     (1) newly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the
     evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and
     convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the
     movant guilty of the offense; or

    (2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral
    review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.

28 U.S.C. ยง 2255. The First Circuit held in Cirilo-Munoz v. United States, 404 F.3d 527,

533 (1st Cir. 2005), that the Supreme Court's decision in Booker does not apply



a new rule of constitutional law made retroactive to his case. His petition is meritless.

    Because Genao posits no new claims in his successive 5 2255, the government will

not address them here. If however, the Court wishes to be briefed on the repetitive

claims nonetheless, the government will file a supplement to this response.

111. CONCLUSION

   Because this is obviously a successive 9 2255 veiled as a new motion, because the

motion addresses several identical claims raised in his original petition, because

Petitioner did not obtain an order from the Circuit Court authorizing this successive

petition, and because Booker does not apply retroactively to his case; this Court, in the

exercise of its discretion, should dismiss the petition.
