               RECOMMENDED DECISION ON 28 U.S.C. § 2255 MOTION

       In this action, Petitioner Nicholas Skoby moves, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §2255, to vacate,

set aside or correct his sentence. (Motion, ECF No. 51; Attachments, ECF Nos. 51-1 to 51-5.)

Petitioner pled guilty to interference with commerce by robbery, 18 U.S.C. § 1951 (Count 1); and

to using, carrying, or possessing a firearm in relation to or in furtherance of a crime of violence,

18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A) (Count 2). (Judgment, ECF No. 39 at 1.) The Court sentenced Petitioner

to a term of imprisonment of 57 months on Count 1 and 84 months on Count 2, to be served

consecutively for a total sentence of 141 months, followed by a term of three years of supervised

release on Count 1 and five years on Count 2, to be served concurrently. (Id. at 2-3.) Petitioner

appealed from the sentence, challenging the 84-month consecutive sentence on Count 2 on the

ground that the Court erred in finding that Petitioner brandished the weapon; the First Circuit

affirmed the sentence. United States v. Skoby, No. 12-1633 (1st Cir. June 4, 2013) (unpublished).

         Petitioner maintains that his counsel misrepresented the possible length of the sentence

(ECF Nos. 51-1 at 1, 51-5 at 1) on the firearms charge (Count 2); that counsel should have obtained

a psychiatric examination to determine whether Petitioner was competent to plead guilty (ECF No.

51-4 at 3); that there was an insufficient factual basis for the plea (ECF No. 51-1 at 1); and that the

plea was involuntary (ECF No. 51-4 at 2).

         Petitioner also contends that his counsel failed to raise certain objections to the presentence

investigation report (ECF Nos. 51-2 at 1, 51-3 at 2, 51-5 at 1); failed to object to hearsay and other

statements (ECF No. 51-4 at 2-3); failed to obtain a psychiatric evaluation in preparation for

sentencing (ECF No. 51-1 at 1-2), and failed to prepare Petitioner for sentencing (ECF No. 51-2

at 1).

         Petitioner further argues that his confession was coerced (ECF No. 51-4 at 1); that the Court

wrongly denied bail (ECF No. 51-4 at 2); that counsel failed to move to suppress evidence (ECF

Nos. 51-3 at 1, 51-4 at 1-2); that the Government failed to preserve evidence (ECF No. 51-4 at 3);

and that the case should not have been prosecuted in federal court (ECF No. 51-3 at 1). Although

Petitioner mentions Alleyne v. United States, 133 S. Ct. 2151 (2013), the nature of his argument

on the issue, if any, is unclear. (Motion at 12.)

         The Government requests a summary dismissal. (Response, ECF No. 64.) As explained

below, after review and consideration of the parties’ filings and the record, the recommendation is

that the Court deny Petitioner’ request for relief, and dismiss Petitioner’s motion.

                   I.      FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

         The following facts regarding the federal charges are derived from the prosecution version,

which Petitioner admitted at his plea hearing was true. (Prosecution Version, ECF No. 30; Plea

Tr., ECF No. 47 at 15-16.) On August 29, 2011, at approximately 4:39 p.m., Petitioner entered a

pharmacy engaged in interstate commerce in Millinocket, Maine. (Prosecution Version at 1.)

Petitioner walked up to the pharmacy counter and presented a note that stated: “Give me ritilin +

Percocet or else you die!” (Id.) Petitioner pulled his shirt up, displaying a pistol that he had in the

waistband of his pants. (Id.) Petitioner was wearing a black NY Yankees baseball cap. (Id.) After

reading the note, the pharmacist began to get the pills. (Id.) Petitioner told her that she had five

seconds and began to count. (Id.) The pharmacist placed the pills she had collected in a bag and

handed them to Petitioner. (Id.) Petitioner told the pharmacist to give him the money drawer, and

she complied. (Id.) Petitioner took the cash from the drawer and walked out of the store with the

cash and the drugs.       (Id.)   According to the pharmacy’s records, Petitioner took 143

oxycodone/acetaminophen tablets and 160 tablets of methylphenidate (Ritalin). (Id.) He also took

$586 in cash. (Id.) He exited the store at approximately 4:43 p.m. (Id.)

       At approximately 5:20 p.m., law enforcement officers located, just outside Millinocket, a

vehicle that matched the description that witnesses had provided of the get-away vehicle used in

the robbery. (Id.) Petitioner was driving the vehicle. (Id.) When the officers attempted to stop

the vehicle, the car accelerated and a chase ensued. (Id.) At one point, the vehicle pulled to the

side of the road and Petitioner and a male passenger fled the vehicle. (Id.) In a search of the

vehicle, officers found a black plastic gun case, a box of 9 mm bullets, the robbery note, United

States currency, and some of the pills and pill bottles taken from the pharmacy. (Id. at 1-2.)

       Law enforcement found and apprehended Petitioner a short distance from the abandoned

vehicle. (Id. at 2.) Petitioner was carrying $495 and a 9mm High Point pistol. (Id.) He was

wearing a black NY Yankees baseball cap. (Id.)

           An officer met with Petitioner and administered the Miranda warnings.1 (Id.) Petitioner

agreed to speak with the officer and told the officer that he had presented a note to the pharmacy

that said something like “give me the pills or else.” (Id.) Petitioner also reported that he demanded

money and that the pharmacist gave him pills and money. (Id.) Petitioner told the officer that he

had a gun, which he had purchased at the Belfast Trading Post, but that he had not threatened

anyone with it. (Id.) Records show that Petitioner purchased a 9 mm High Point pistol bearing

the same serial number as the one found on Petitioner, and a box of 9 mm ammunition, at a

federally licensed firearms dealer in Northport, Maine, on August 26, 2011. (Id.) The pistol was

manufactured outside Maine. (Id.) The clerk who sold it to Petitioner recalled that the purchaser

was wearing a dark NY Yankees baseball cap at the time of the sale. (Id.)

           Petitioner was indicted in November 2011. (Indictment, ECF No. 9.) He pled guilty in

February 2012 following a hearing conducted pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 11. (Plea Tr. at 1, 20.)

Petitioner entered the plea without a plea agreement. (Plea Tr. at 16-17.)

           Petitioner was sentenced in May 2012. (Sentencing Tr., ECF No. 48 at 1, 35-36.) The

Court calculated the guidelines sentence as follows: the base offense level was 20. (Id. at 26.) The

Court added one level, resulting in a total offense level of 21, because the object of the robbery

was to obtain a controlled substance. (Id.) Petitioner’s criminal history category was III, which,

together with the total offense level of 21, yielded an applicable guidelines range of 46 to 57

months. (Id. at 26-27.) On Count 2, the Court found that Petitioner brandished the firearm and

concluded, therefore, that a mandatory seven-year consecutive term of imprisonment must be

imposed, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §924(c)(1)(A). (Id. at 28, 32.)

         The Court then discussed the sentencing factors, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §3553(a), noting

that “[t]he most striking part of the defendant’s history . . . is his mental health diagnoses and his

drug use.” (Id. at 27-29.) Among other things, the Court found that

         [t]he defendant has a long and extensive history of illegal drug use, including
         marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, and bath salts. He’s also abused alcohol and
         prescriptive medication. On the day of the robbery itself, the defendant had used
         marijuana, alcohol, crack cocaine, and bath salts before he went into [the
         pharmacy].

(Id. at 29.) The Court made a number of findings, including Petitioner’s “two prior theft

convictions, an OUI conviction, and a forgery conviction.” (Id.) In addition, the Court found that

while Petitioner was in jail, before he pled guilty, he “wrote three letters to his girlfriend asking

her to smuggle Suboxone strips into the Penobscot County Jail.” (Id. at 31.)2 The Court noted

additional compounding factors, including that the robbery was of a pharmacy for drugs and cash;

that Petitioner carried and showed a gun during the robbery; that the gun was loaded and had a

bullet in the chamber; that Petitioner counted down while waiting for the pills, and thereby

implicitly threatened to shoot the victim; that Petitioner was intoxicated with a mixture of alcohol,

cocaine, bath salts, and marijuana; that Petitioner led police on a high-speed car chase; that

Petitioner fled into the woods, attempting to hide; and that Petitioner, before he was apprehended,

snorted some of the drugs that he stole. (Id. at 31-32.)

         Petitioner appealed from the mandatory consecutive 84-month sentence on Count 2,

arguing that (1) within the framework of 18 U.S.C. §924(c), the meaning of “use” and “brandish”

is ambiguous, and the rule of lenity requires that ambiguity in sentencing statutes be construed in

favor of the defendant; and (2) the evidence was insufficient to support the District Court’s finding



2
  The Court noted that Petitioner “attempted to co-opt his girlfriend to try and smuggle Suboxone into jail” sometime
between August 2011 and January 2012. (Sentencing Tr., ECF No. 48 at 32.) The presentence investigation report
states that Petitioner was discovered with the contraband after a contact visit with his girlfriend.

that Petitioner brandished a firearm within the meaning of section 924(c)(4). (Petitioner’s

Appellate Brief at 2.) On June 4, 2013, the First Circuit affirmed the sentence, “focusing

specifically on the imposition of a seven-year consecutive sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)

for ‘brandish[ing]’ a firearm during a robbery.”3 Skoby, No. 12-1633. (ECF No. 49.) Petitioner

did not file a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court.

           Petitioner signed his section 2255 motion on September 2, 2014, and it was filed on

September 5, 2014. (Motion at 13.) The Government concedes that Petitioner filed his section

2255 motion timely. (Response at 2.)

                                                 II.      DISCUSSION

       A. Legal Standard

           A person may move to vacate his or her sentence on one of four different grounds: (1) “that

the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States”; (2) “that

the court was without jurisdiction” to impose its sentence; (3) “that the sentence was in excess of

the maximum authorized by law”; and (4) that the sentence “is otherwise subject to collateral

attack.” 28 U.S.C. § 2255(a); see Knight v. United States, 37 F.3d 769, 772 (1st Cir. 1994).4 Here,

to the extent that Petitioner alleges ineffective assistance of counsel, his right to counsel is




3
    Title 28 U.S.C. § 924(c)(4) states:

           For purposes of this subsection, the term “brandish” means, with respect to a firearm, to display all
           or part of the firearm, or otherwise make the presence of the firearm known to another person, in
           order to intimidate that person, regardless of whether the firearm is directly visible to that person.
4
    Title 28 U.S.C. § 2255(a) states:

           A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming the right
           to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or
           laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that
           the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral
           attack, may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.

guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment, and therefore Petitioner argues that the sentence was

imposed in violation of “the Constitution or laws of the United States.”

       A section 2255 petitioner has the burden to establish by a preponderance of the evidence

that he or she is entitled to section 2255 relief. David v. United States, 134 F.3d 470, 474 (1st Cir.

1998); United States v. DiCarlo, 575 F.2d 952, 954 (1st Cir. 1978). The Court “is at liberty to

employ the knowledge gleaned during previous proceedings and make findings thereon without

convening an additional hearing.” United States v. McGill, 11 F.3d 223, 225 (1st Cir. 1993).

“Where a defendant has procedurally defaulted a claim by failing to raise it on direct review, the

claim may be raised in habeas only if the defendant can first demonstrate either ‘cause’ and actual

‘prejudice,’ or that he is ‘actually innocent.’” Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 622 (1998)

(citations omitted).

       On a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner “must establish both that

counsel’s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that there exists a

reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding

would have been different.” Turner v. United States, 699 F.3d 578, 584 (1st Cir. 2012) (citing

Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 688 (1984)); see also Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 59

(1985) (holding that “in order to satisfy the ‘prejudice’ requirement, the defendant must show that

there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty

and would have insisted on going to trial”). The two prongs of the ineffective assistance test are

commonly referred to as the “cause” and “actual prejudice” tests. Bucci v. United States, 662 F.3d

18, 29 (1st Cir. 2011). The “cause” test is “a ‘fairly tolerant’ one because ‘the Constitution pledges

to an accused an effective defense, not necessarily a perfect defense or a successful defense.’”

Moreno-Espada v. United States, 666 F.3d 60, 65 (1st Cir. 2012) (quoting Scarpa v. Dubois, 38



                                                  7
Case 1:11-cr-00208-JAW Document 65 Filed 06/05/15 Page 8 of 26                          PageID #: 253



F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1994)). The issue is whether counsel’s performance was “‘within the wide range

of reasonable professional assistance’ that a competent criminal defense counsel could provide

under ‘prevailing professional norms.’” Bucci, 662 F.3d at 30 (quoting Strickland, 446 U.S. at

688-89).

        In reviewing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, courts should be mindful that

“‘[c]ounsel is not required to waste the court’s time with futile or frivolous motions.’” United

States v. Hart, 933 F.2d 80, 83 (1st Cir. 1991) (quoting United States v. Wright, 573 F.2d 681, 684

(1st Cir. 1978)); see Tse v. United States, 290 F.3d 462, 465 (1st Cir. 2002) (“Since [the

petitioner’s] claims fail on the merits, his related claims that counsel rendered ineffective

assistance in failing to press the claims at trial or on appeal must also fail.”)

        A district court that reviews claims of ineffective assistance of counsel is not required to

address both prongs of the test because a failure to meet either prong will undermine the claim.

Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697. “Evidentiary hearings on § 2255 petitions are the exception, not the

norm, and there is a heavy burden on the petitioner to demonstrate that an evidentiary hearing is

warranted. An evidentiary hearing ‘is not necessary when a [§] 2255 petition (1) is inadequate on

its face, or (2) although facially adequate, is conclusively refuted as to the alleged facts by the files

and records of the case.’” Moreno-Morales v. United States, 334 F.3d 140, 145 (1st Cir. 2003)

(citation omitted) (quoting DiCarlo, 575 F.2d at 954).

    B. Grounds Asserted and Analysis

            1. Claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on alleged misrepresentations
               regarding the possible length of the sentence

        Petitioner claims that counsel was ineffective because counsel misrepresented the length

of the sentence. Specifically, he alleges that counsel told him that if he pled guilty to both counts,

he would receive a reduction at sentencing for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G.


                                                   8
Case 1:11-cr-00208-JAW Document 65 Filed 06/05/15 Page 9 of 26                                     PageID #: 254



§3E1.1, and he “would only receive a couple of years.” (ECF No. 51-1 at 1.) Petitioner asserts

that counsel did not explain the significance to his sentence of a finding that he brandished the

weapon, as distinguished from a finding that he used or carried the weapon, as alleged in the

indictment. (Id.) He maintains that as a result of the Court’s colloquy, he thought he would not

receive more than four years in prison. (ECF No. 51-5 at 1.) Petitioner contends that if counsel

had explained the possible sentence fully, he would have pled guilty to the robbery charge, but he

would have gone to trial on the firearms charge and received a shorter sentence. (Id. at 1-2.)

         A review of the record reveals that Petitioner cannot demonstrate prejudice, even if one

assumes that Petitioner could prove that counsel provided inaccurate information.5 First, Petitioner

told the Court, in response to the Court’s questions in the plea colloquy, that no one had made any

promise to him regarding the sentence. (Plea Tr., ECF No. 47 at 18-19.) “[T]he presumption of

truthfulness of the [Fed. R. Crim. P. 11 colloquy] statements will not be overcome unless the

allegations in the § 2255 motion . . . include credible, valid reasons why a departure from those

earlier contradictory statements is now justified.” United States v. Butt, 731 F.2d 75, 80 (1st Cir.

1984). Petitioner has offered no reason for the Court to question the truthfulness of the statement

that he made in the colloquy. As the Tenth Circuit has recognized, the lack of any promises or

guarantees about a petitioner’s sentence is a factor in determining whether there was prejudice as

a result of the petitioner’s mistaken belief that he would be eligible for a sentence reduction.

United States v. Viera, 674 F.3d 1214, 1220 (10th Cir. 2012) (“We have held that an erroneous

sentencing prediction is not prejudicial where the court has conducted an adequate Rule 11

colloquy.”)




5
  The fact that the misrepresentations are assumed for purposes of this discussion shall not be construed to suggest
that the record supports the conclusion that counsel provided inaccurate information.

        Second, according to the First Circuit, “[a]n attorney’s inaccurate prediction of his client’s

probable sentence, standing alone, will not satisfy the prejudice prong of the ineffective assistance

test.” United States v. LaBonte, 70 F.3d 1396, 1413 (1st Cir. 1995), rev’d on other grounds, 520

U.S. 751 (1997)); see also United States v. Arvanitis, 902 F.2d 489, 494 (7th Cir. 1990) (holding

that an inaccurate sentencing prediction by counsel, standing alone, does not satisfy either prong

of the Strickland analysis).

        Third, the Court’s thorough colloquy was more than sufficient to correct any

misunderstanding that Petitioner might have had as the result of counsel’s advice about the length

of the sentence. (Plea Tr. at 9-11.) Regarding the mandatory consecutive seven-year sentence, the

Court stated:

                  THE COURT: . . . [I]f you only carried the gun, you’re subject to, in
        addition to the penalties set forth in Court 1, a mandatory minimum additional term
        of five years, and you could be subject to being placed in jail for the rest of your
        life. . . . Do you understand that these are the penalties, including a mandatory
        consecutive, which means added on to? It basically means, Mr. Skoby, that once I
        figure out what the appropriate sentence is for Count 1 and I fix that sentence, then
        I must add at least five years to your sentence under Count 2. Do you understand
        that if you only carried the firearm, that you’re subject to the – those additional
        penalties?

                THE DEFENDANT: Yes, I am, Your Honor.

                THE COURT: Now, I want you to listen carefully again because the
        penalty is different if you brandished the firearm. If you brandished the firearm, in
        addition to the penalty in Count 1 which I’ve just described, you’re subject to an
        additional mandatory consecutive prison term of at least seven years, and, again,
        you could be in jail for the rest of your life on Count 2 alone. . . . In other words,
        if you brandished the firearm, again, I figure out what the penalty should be for the
        robbery itself, and then I must, if I find that you brandished the firearm, add seven
        years at least, and I could add an amount of time that would place you in prison for
        the rest of your life. Do you understand that these are the minimum and maximum
        penalties that may be imposed in the event you brandished the firearm?

                THE DEFENDANT: Yes, I do, Your Honor.

       Fourth, given the Court’s unequivocal statements to Petitioner about the possibility of a

mandatory seven-year consecutive term on Count 2, Petitioner’s claim that he believed his

sentence would not be longer than four years lacks credibility. David, 134 F.3d at 478 (holding

that a petitioner’s allegations “need not be accepted as true because they state conclusions instead

of facts, contradict the record, or are inherently incredible”) (quotation marks omitted).

Petitioner’s statement that he thought he would receive a reduction for acceptance of responsibility

also lacks credibility, given that sometime between August 2011 and January 2012, i.e., in the

months before the plea hearing, Petitioner committed additional criminal conduct by smuggling

Suboxone into jail.

           2. Claim of ineffective assistance of counsel regarding failure to obtain a
              psychiatric evaluation to determine whether Petitioner was competent to plead
              guilty

       Petitioner claims that counsel was ineffective because he failed to ensure that Petitioner

obtained a psychiatric evaluation to determine whether he was competent to plead guilty. (ECF

No. 51-4 at 3.) Petitioner alleges that he was not properly medicated while he was in jail. (Id.)

       Petitioner’s allegation about his medication in jail contravenes his statements in the plea

colloquy, in which Petitioner, in response to the Court’s questions, told the Court that he had been

prescribed medications by a psychiatrist prior to being incarcerated and that he had taken all of his

prescribed medications in their regular doses in the 24 hours before the plea hearing. (Plea Tr. at

3.) He also told the Court that he had not taken any other drugs or intoxicants in the last 24 hours,

and that he understood the proceedings. (Id. at 3-4.) The Court found that Petitioner did not appear

to be under the influence of any medicine, drug, or other substance that may affect his judgment.

(Id. at 4.) Petitioner presents no “credible, valid reasons” why the Court should not presume the

truthfulness of his statements in the plea hearing about his medications. See Butt, 731 F.2d at 80.



                                                 11
Case 1:11-cr-00208-JAW Document 65 Filed 06/05/15 Page 12 of 26                                     PageID #: 257



In addition, none of Petitioner’s other responses to the Court’s inquiries suggests any basis for

concern about Petitioner’s competency to proceed with the plea. To the contrary, Petitioner

consistently demonstrated an understanding of the proceeding, and an appreciation for the

significance of the plea.

         Particularly given Petitioner’s own statements and presentation during the proceeding, the

record lacks any objective evidence to support Petitioner’s claim that a psychiatric evaluation to

assess his competence to plead guilty was warranted. Counsel, therefore, was not deficient for not

requesting an evaluation, nor was Petitioner prejudiced by the decision not to request an

evaluation.

              3. Claim of insufficient factual basis for the plea and associated claim of
                 ineffective assistance of counsel

         Petitioner claims that there was an insufficient factual basis for his guilty plea. (ECF No.

51-1 at 1.) In particular, Petitioner alleges that he told counsel: “I didn’t think I had a gun on me

during [the robbery] . . . .” (Id.) He asserts: “There was only the pharmacist saying she saw a gun.

In [the] video you cannot tell if [there] is a gun. There is [not] sufficient evidence that I brandished

[a] gun in [the] robbery.” (Id. at 2.) Petitioner also contends that counsel failed to investigate the

matter. (Id.)6

         The Court relied on the prosecution version of the crimes to determine whether there was

a factual basis for the plea. (Plea Tr. at 14.) Counsel represented that he reviewed the prosecution

version “numerous times” with Petitioner, that counsel was satisfied that the Government could

produce the evidence set forth in the prosecution version, and that the admissible evidence would

permit a properly instructed jury to find Petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. (Id. at 14-



6
  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(3) (“Before entering judgment on a guilty plea, the court must determine that there is a
factual basis for the plea.”); McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 467 (1969).

                                                         12
Case 1:11-cr-00208-JAW Document 65 Filed 06/05/15 Page 13 of 26                     PageID #: 258



15.) Petitioner told the Court that he had had an opportunity to review the prosecution version,

that he understood its significance, and that he did not disagree with anything set forth in the

prosecution version. (Id. at 15-16.) Petitioner also advised the Court that the prosecution version

was true to his personal knowledge. (Id. at 16.) On the basis of the prosecution version, counsel’s

responses, and Petitioner’s responses, the Court found a factual basis for Petitioner’s guilty plea.

(Id.)

        According to the prosecution version, Petitioner pulled up his shirt and displayed a pistol

in the waistband of his pants. (Prosecution Version at 1.) Counsel represented at the plea hearing

that in addition to the prosecution version, the Government’s evidence included a video of the

crime, the statements of two witnesses, and Petitioner’s post-Miranda confession. (Plea Tr. at 19.)

        Petitioner’s section 2255 allegation that he did not believe he had a gun on his person when

he committed the robbery directly contradicts his admission, through the plea colloquy, which

included his acceptance of the prosecution version, that he displayed a pistol during the robbery.

Petitioner presents no “credible, valid reasons” why the Court should not presume the truthfulness

of his statements in the plea hearing regarding Petitioner’s belief that the prosecution version was

true to his personal knowledge. See Butt, 731 F.2d at 80. Petitioner’s claim that a factual basis

for the plea was lacking and his related claim of ineffective assistance of counsel are unsupported

by the record.

           4. Claim that the plea was involuntary

        Petitioner argues that his plea was involuntary. (ECF No. 51-4 at 2.) He asserts that he

pled guilty “without understanding the charges,” and “without fully understanding the

consequences of the guilty plea.” (Id.) Petitioner maintains that language difficulties impeded his

ability to understand the charges. (Id.)



                                                 13
Case 1:11-cr-00208-JAW Document 65 Filed 06/05/15 Page 14 of 26                                        PageID #: 259



           The Court explained to Petitioner at the beginning of the plea hearing that the purpose of

the hearing was for the Court to determine whether Petitioner entered his plea knowingly and

voluntarily. (Plea Tr. at 2.) In response to the Court’s questions, Petitioner told the Court that he

had had almost one year in college. (Id.) After asking several questions regarding Petitioner’s

medications, the Court asked Petitioner: “Do you believe you understand what’s happening in

these proceedings?” (Id. at 4.) Petitioner answered: “Yes, I do, Your Honor.” (Id.) The Court

found Petitioner to be competent to enter a plea, and then asked: “Has [counsel] explained to you

the consequences that may flow from these proceedings?” (Id.) Petitioner answered: “Yes, he

has, Your Honor.” (Id.) In response to further questions by the Court, Petitioner told the Court

that counsel had informed him of the elements and the nature of the charged offenses and the

penalties that may be imposed. (Id. at 6.) Counsel told the Court that he was satisfied that

Petitioner understood the charges and penalties. (Id.) Subsequently, as the Court reviewed the

elements of each of the charged crimes and the facts that pertain to each of the charges, Petitioner

told the Court that he understood them. (Id. at 7-8.)7


7
    Regarding the robbery count (Count 1), the Court told Petitioner:

           [The indictment] alleges that on or about August 29, 2011, in the District of Maine, which means
           the state of Maine, you obstructed, delayed, and affected commerce and the movement of articles in
           commerce by robbery. Specifically, you took the personal property . . . namely, United States
           currency and controlled substances, that belonged to [the pharmacy] in Millinocket, Maine. It
           alleges that [the pharmacy] is a business that was engaged in interstate commerce and an industry
           that affects interstate commerce. It alleges that you took the controlled substances and currency
           from [pharmacy] employees against their will by . . . using actual and threatened force, violence,
           and fear of immediate and future injury to the employees. It alleges that at the time you took the
           currency and controlled substances, you were armed with a handgun and that you thus violated
           federal criminal law.

(Plea Tr., ECF No. 47 at 7.) Regarding the firearms count (Count 2), the Court told Petitioner:

           Count 2 alleges use, carrying, or possession of a firearm during and in relation to and in furtherance
           of a crime of violence. It says that on [or] about August 29, 2011, in the District of Maine, you
           knowingly used and carried a firearm, that is, a 9 millimeter Hi-Point handgun, during and in relation
           to a crime of violence . . . for which you may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, namely
           the offense I already described, the robbery, and that you knowingly possessed that firearm in
           furtherance of the offense described in Count 1, again, the robbery.

                                                            14
Case 1:11-cr-00208-JAW Document 65 Filed 06/05/15 Page 15 of 26                        PageID #: 260



         After explaining the penalties and receiving Petitioner’s assurance that he understood them,

the Court asked Petitioner if he understood that the law did not require him to plead guilty, and

Petitioner could decide not to plead guilty up until the time the Court accepted the guilty plea. (Id.

at 11-12.) The Court then reviewed Petitioner’s jury trial rights and other attendant rights that

Petitioner would waive if he pled guilty. (Id. at 12.) Petitioner told the Court that he understood

each of these rights. (Id. at 12-13.) After the Court determined that there was a factual basis for

the plea, in response to further questioning, Petitioner told the Court that no one had threatened

him or coerced him into pleading guilty. (Id. at 16.)

         Petitioner told the Court that he understood that the Court had the authority to determine

an appropriate sentence, that the Court was not required to accept the sentencing recommendations

of the parties, and that Petitioner would not have the right to withdraw his guilty plea at sentencing.

(Id. at 17.) After the Court explained to Petitioner that the sentencing guidelines were advisory

and that Petitioner would be sentenced in accordance with certain factors set forth in federal

criminal law, the Court asked Petitioner if he had discussed with counsel how the issues might

affect his sentence. Petitioner confirmed that he had discussed the issues with counsel. (Id.)

         As part of the plea proceeding, the Court also explained that the Probation Office would

prepare a presentence investigation report to be used to determine an advisory sentencing range,

that Petitioner would have the opportunity to challenge facts in the report, and that the Court had

the authority to impose a more or less severe sentence than called for by the sentencing guidelines.

(Id. at 17-18.) Petitioner informed the Court that he understood the process, and that he would not

be permitted to withdraw his plea in the event that the Court’s sentence was more severe than the




(Plea Tr. at 7-8.)


                                                  15
Case 1:11-cr-00208-JAW Document 65 Filed 06/05/15 Page 16 of 26                                        PageID #: 261



guidelines sentence would have been. (Id. at 18.) Petitioner told the Court that he understood that

he would be required to serve all of the term of imprisonment except for good-time deductions,

and that he would not be permitted to serve any part of it on parole. (Id.) Finally, Petitioner

advised the Court that no one made any promises to him in an effort to persuade him to plead

guilty, nor did anyone promise him anything about what the Government would recommend or

what the sentence would be. (Id. at 18-19.)

         The extensive colloquy between Petitioner and the Court lacks any suggestion that

Petitioner’s plea was in any way involuntary. That is, Petitioner has presented no “credible, valid

reasons” for the Court not to presume the truthfulness of Petitioner’s statements that he understood

the charges and that he entered his plea knowingly and voluntarily. See Butt, 731 F.2d at 80.

              5. Claim of ineffective assistance of counsel regarding failure to raise objections
                 to the presentence investigation report

         Petitioner claims that counsel was ineffective because he failed to raise certain objections

to the revised presentence investigation report.8 (ECF Nos. 51-2 at 1, 51-3 at 2, 51-5 at 1.) More

particularly, he alleges that counsel failed to object at sentencing to the victim’s statement: “[He]

told me I was going to die over and over again and counted down the seconds.” (ECF Nos. 51-2

at 1, 51-3 at 1; Sentencing Tr. at 11.) Petitioner also contends that counsel failed to object to

statements that Petitioner planned the robbery, that he admitted to having violence on his mind,

that he intentionally lifted his shirt to show his gun to the pharmacist, that he threatened the

pharmacist, that he robbed the pharmacy to get pills to use to buy other drugs, that he had a bullet


8
  Petitioner raised three objections to the revised presentence investigation report. (Sentencing Tr. at 3-10.) First, in
response to a statement in the report about a prior theft conviction and probation revocation, Petitioner objected to
language that referred to a robbery involving a firearm. At sentencing, the Court struck the language. (Id. at 6.)
Second, Petitioner objected to a reference that he had been affiliated with a gang, and the Court struck the language.
(Id. at 7-8.) Petitioner withdrew his third objection, which pertained to a paragraph in the report stating that Petitioner
“went to the pharmacy to get pills for money to buy other drugs.” (Id. at 9-10.) Petitioner told the Court that he did
not deny heavy use of alcohol and use of marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, and bath salts. When the Court then
asked whether Petitioner had any other objections to the report, Petitioner responded that he did not. (Id. at 10.)

                                                            16
Case 1:11-cr-00208-JAW Document 65 Filed 06/05/15 Page 17 of 26                                     PageID #: 262



in his gun, and that he brandished the gun. (ECF No. 51-2 at 1.) Petitioner argues that the

statements in the presentence investigation report about his use of pain medications and bath salts

were inaccurate. (ECF No. 51-3 at 2.) Petitioner maintains that counsel should have “objected to

the change in Count 2 in the second PSI report and the unfactual statements” about him. (ECF

No. 51-5 at 1.)9

         Although the revised presentence investigation report does not state directly that Petitioner

admitted that he had violence on his mind at the time of the robbery, the Government made a

statement to that effect at sentencing. (Sentencing Tr. at 15.) Regardless of whether Petitioner

intended to assert a claim of prosecutorial misconduct or a claim of ineffective assistance of

counsel, Petitioner’s claim fails. Petitioner admitted the truth of the prosecution version, which

states that Petitioner walked up to the pharmacy counter and presented a note that stated: “Give

me ritilin + Percocet or else you die!” (Prosecution Version at 1; Plea Tr. at 16.) By admitting the

truth of the prosecution version, Petitioner in essence conceded that he planned to commit the

crime with a threat of violence. Petitioner’s argument, therefore, that the assertion that he had

violence on his mind was inaccurate or unwarranted under the circumstances is without merit.

         Similarly, Petitioner’s contention that his counsel’s performance was substandard because

he did not object to the recitation of the other facts, including facts relevant to Count 2, is

unavailing. The prosecution version, which Petitioner adopted at sentencing, asserts that Petitioner

pulled his shirt up, and displayed a pistol he had in the waistband of his pants. (Prosecution

Version at 1.) Petitioner thus admitted to displaying the weapon. Under the circumstances,

counsel had no factual basis upon which to object to the report’s statement that Petitioner was

subject to a seven-year consecutive term on Count 2. Counsel, therefore, did not perform


9
 The Government correctly points out that to the extent Petitioner asserts any underlying claim that the Probation
Office misstated facts in the presentence investigation report, that claim is procedurally defaulted. (Response at 37.)

                                                          17
Case 1:11-cr-00208-JAW Document 65 Filed 06/05/15 Page 18 of 26                      PageID #: 263



ineffectively regarding the report’s recommended consecutive sentence. Furthermore, Petitioner

was not prejudiced insofar as the First Circuit upheld the Court’s finding that Petitioner brandished

the weapon. Skoby, No. 12-1633.

       Finally, Petitioner provides no factual basis on which counsel could have objected to either

the statement in the presentence investigation report or to the sentencing finding that the gun “was

loaded and had a bullet in the chamber.” (Sentencing Tr. at 32.) Consequently, Petitioner cannot

prevail on his contention that his counsel was ineffective.

           6. Claim of ineffective assistance of counsel regarding failure to object to
              hearsay statements

       Petitioner claims that counsel was ineffective because he failed to object to hearsay and

other statements by witnesses; Petitioner argues that his Sixth Amendment right to confront

witnesses against him was violated. (ECF No. 51-4 at 2-3.) As the Government points out, any

Sixth Amendment claim regarding Petitioner’s confrontation rights is procedurally defaulted.

(Response at 44.)

       Petitioner does not specify which statements are the subject of this claim, and, therefore,

the claim fails for vagueness. David, 134 F.3d at 478 (vague allegations do not entitle a habeas

petitioner to an evidentiary hearing). In addition, regardless of whether Petitioner refers to

statements relevant to the plea hearing or statements at sentencing, the claim lacks merit. In the

colloquy with the Court during the plea proceeding, Petitioner acknowledged that in entering the

plea, he was waiving his right to cross examine witnesses at trial. (Plea Tr. at 12-13.) The Court’s

finding that Petitioner knowingly and voluntarily waived his trial rights which, as the Court had

previously explained to Petitioner, included his right to cross-examine the Government’s

witnesses, is sound and clearly supported by the record. (Id. at 12-13, 20.)

Case 1:11-cr-00208-JAW Document 65 Filed 06/05/15 Page 19 of 26                                        PageID #: 264



           As to statements made at sentencing, the First Circuit has held that “[r]eliable hearsay is,

of course, admissible during sentencing proceedings.” United States v. Ramírez-Negrόn, 751 F.3d

42, 52 (1st Cir. 2014). Petitioner makes no argument that any statement admitted at sentencing is

unreliable. Furthermore, a defendant has no Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses at

sentencing. United States v. Luciano, 414 F.3d 174, 179 (1st Cir. 2005).

                7. Claim of ineffective assistance of counsel regarding failure to obtain a
                   psychiatric evaluation for sentencing purposes

           Petitioner claims ineffective assistance of counsel based on counsel’s failure to obtain a

psychiatric evaluation of Petitioner for sentencing purposes. (ECF Nos. 51-1 at 1-2, 51-3 at 2.)

He alleges that the psychiatric evaluation would have shown that he was not in his right mind when

he committed the robbery.10 (ECF Nos. 51-1 at 2, 51-3 at 2.)

           The record evidence does not support a conclusion that Petitioner was unable to appreciate

the wrongfulness of his acts. In fact, the record plainly supports the determination that he

understood the wrongfulness of his conduct. He purchased a gun three days before the robbery,

he prepared a demand note to present at the pharmacy counter, he told the pharmacist that she had

five seconds and began to count, he told the pharmacist to give him the cash drawer, he took the

cash from the drawer, he drove the get-away vehicle, he led police on a chase, he stopped the

vehicle, and he tried to flee. (Prosecution Version at 1-2.) Petitioner’s actions are calculating and,

     The insanity defense statute provides:

           (a) Affirmative defense. It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution under any Federal statute that,
           at the time of the commission of the acts constituting the offense, the defendant, as a result of a
           severe mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness
           of his acts. Mental disease or defect does not otherwise constitute a defense.

           (b) Burden of proof. The defendant has the burden of proving the defense of insanity by clear and
           convincing evidence.

18 U.S.C. § 17.

particularly his attempts to avoid apprehension, reflect that he was aware of the wrongfulness of

his conduct. Because the record does not support a finding that Petitioner failed to appreciate the

wrongfulness of his acts, counsel was not ineffective for failing to obtain a psychiatric report

regarding Petitioner’s substance abuse problem or his mental health history.                               “[C]ounsel’s

performance was not deficient if he declined to pursue a futile tactic.” Vieux v. Pepe, 184 F.3d 59,

64 (1st Cir. 1999) (applying Strickland standard to a habeas claim under 28 U.S.C. § 2254).

              8. Claim of ineffective assistance of counsel regarding failure to prepare for
                 sentencing

         Petitioner claims that counsel was ineffective because he failed to prepare Petitioner for

sentencing. (ECF No. 51-2 at 1.) Petitioner also alleges that counsel was unprepared to discuss

Petitioner’s life, his mental health history, and his substance abuse history.11 (ECF No. 51-3 at 2.)

Specifically, Petitioner argues that counsel misrepresented to the Court that Petitioner committed

the crimes due to his addiction to Oxycontin and bath salts, when in fact, Petitioner alleges, he did

not use pain medications and had not used bath salts before the day he committed the offenses.

(Id.) He maintains that had counsel explained the role of Petitioner’s use of bath salts and the fact

that he had not been on his prescribed medications, the Court might have been more lenient. (Id.)

         Petitioner’s section 2255 allegations are inconsistent with his statements at sentencing. At

sentencing, Petitioner told the Court, in response to the Court’s questions, that he had gone over

the presentence investigation report with counsel and that he understood the report. (Sentencing

Tr. at 4.) After the Court went through each of Petitioner’s objections to the report, the Court

asked Petitioner if he had any additional objections, and Petitioner replied that he did not.

(Sentencing Tr. at 10.) Significantly, Petitioner did not object at sentencing to the statement in the


11
  Although Petitioner alleges that counsel failed to raise important points about Petitioner’s life history and his mental
health history, Petitioner’s specific allegations relate to counsel’s presentation of Petitioner’s drug abuse history rather
than other aspects of his personal history. (ECF No. 51-3 at 2.)

                                                            20
Case 1:11-cr-00208-JAW Document 65 Filed 06/05/15 Page 21 of 26                        PageID #: 266



report that he “admitted to experimenting with ‘monkey dust’ or ‘bath salts’ on the day of his

arrest,” or that he abused prescription pain medications. When the Court specifically asked

whether Petitioner used “a whole host of drugs,” including marijuana, heavy use of alcohol,

cocaine, crack cocaine, and bath salts, Petitioner affirmed that he had. (Sentencing Tr. at 9-10.)

       Counsel’s approach at sentencing was to emphasize that Petitioner had a drug abuse

problem when the offense occurred. Counsel attempted to persuade the Court that by the time of

sentencing Petitioner, was “not the same person.” (Id. at 17.) The Court was unpersuaded,

however, because Petitioner had tried to smuggle Suboxone into jail after he had been incarcerated

for about four months. (Id. at 18, 32.) Counsel’s strategy and presentation were not deficient; the

drug abuse issue was central to the presentation at sentencing, but unfortunately for Petitioner, his

effort to smuggle drugs into jail undermined counsel’s argument. Counsel’s approach, however,

was not unreasonable under the circumstances.

       Additionally, Petitioner was not prejudiced by counsel’s approach to Petitioner’s drug

abuse history; regardless of whether Petitioner took bath salts for the first time on the day of the

offense, Petitioner does not dispute that he has a long history of drug abuse, and that he was

intoxicated with alcohol and a number of drugs, including bath salts, when he committed the crime.

Petitioner’s drug use, therefore, was necessarily an issue for the Court’s consideration at

sentencing. The record reflects that the Court gave careful consideration to Petitioner’s life history,

his mental health history, and his drug abuse history in the sentencing process. (Id. at 9, 17-18,

28-29, 31-32.) In other words, Petitioner’s drug use would have been an important issue at

sentencing regardless of his counsel’s approach.

          Petitioner claims that counsel was ineffective because he failed to move to suppress

evidence of an allegedly coerced confession or other evidence. (ECF Nos. 51-3 at 1, 51-4 at 1-2.)

Regarding the confession, Petitioner alleges that law enforcement officers told him that he would

“physically get hurt again” if he did not confess. (ECF No. 51-4 at 1.) The Government argues,

correctly, that Petitioner’s claim of a coerced confession is procedurally defaulted. (Response at

26-27.)

          Even if the Court were to consider the merit of Petitioner’s contention, Petitioner cannot

demonstrate either cause or prejudice because the record does not support the underlying claim of

coercion. Although Petitioner now alleges that he was coerced into confessing, all of the record

evidence, including Petitioner’s own statements in the plea hearing, is inconsistent with the

suggestion that a motion to suppress the confession on the basis that it was coerced had any factual

basis. The Court asked Petitioner whether the prosecution version, which includes reference to a

post-Miranda confession, was accurate and whether he disagreed with anything stated in the

prosecution version. (Prosecution Version at 2; Plea Tr. at 15-16.) Petitioner responded that the

prosecution version was accurate, and that he did not disagree with anything in it. (Plea Tr. at 15-

16.) Petitioner’s claim of a coerced statement thus lacks any support on the record. 12




12
   Petitioner makes a general allegation that “counsel never suppressed any evidence,” but it does not appear that
Petitioner intends to make the argument that counsel should have moved to suppress evidence on Fourth Amendment
grounds. (ECF No. 51-3 at 1.) Petitioner alleges that witnesses made untrue statements, there was no bullet in the
gun, he did not count down or repeat his death threat to the pharmacist, he did not plan the robbery, and he did not rob
the pharmacy to obtain drugs in order to buy other drugs. (Id.) By pleading guilty, Petitioner waived any Fourth
Amendment claim; the Court explained to Petitioner in the plea hearing that one of the trial rights that he would be
waiving if he pled guilty was the opportunity to object to the Government’s evidence. (Plea Tr. at 13.) Any free-
standing Fourth Amendment claim is therefore procedurally defaulted, but regardless of that, none of these allegations
give rise to any Fourth Amendment issues in the context of this case.

             10. Claim that the Court wrongly denied bail

         Petitioner claims that the Court wrongly denied bail. (ECF No. 51-4 at 2.) Claims relating

to pre-trial bail are not cognizable under section 2255. See Lynn v. United States, 365 F.3d 1225,

1233 (11th Cir. 2004) (noting that “claims of excessive bail are not cognizable in a section 2255

action”) (quotation marks omitted).13

             11. Claim that the Government failed to provide or preserve evidence

         Petitioner contends that the Government failed to provide or preserve evidence favorable

to Petitioner. (ECF No. 51-4 at 3.) Petitioner specifically argues that an audio or video of the

confession and a video of the high-speed chase exist, and that the items were either not provided

or not preserved. (Id.)

         The Government represents that no audio or video recording of Petitioner’s confession was

generated, and the Government is not aware of whether Petitioner’s high-speed chase after the

robbery was videotaped. (Response at 44-45.) Petitioner has cited no facts to support his

contention. The record thus lacks any evidence upon which the Court could conclude that the

Government either withheld or did not preserve any evidence that might have been favorable to

Petitioner. Petitioner’s claim, therefore, that the Government violated his rights under Brady v.

Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), lacks merit.14



13
   Furthermore, as the Government points out, the issue is procedurally defaulted in any event because Petitioner
waived it when, in November 2011, he knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to a detention hearing and
consented to being detained in federal custody pending trial. (Response, ECF No. 64 at 43-44; Conditional Order of
Detention Pending Trial, ECF No. 22.) At that time, the Court ordered Petitioner to be federally detained once the
State of Maine released him from state charges and he entered into federal custody. (Id.) In February and May 2012,
Petitioner was only temporarily brought into federal custody for his change-of-plea hearing and sentencing,
respectively; otherwise, he was in state custody at that time. (Writs of Habeas Corpus, ECF Nos. 29, 36.)
14
   The Supreme Court held in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, (1963), that “the suppression by the prosecution of
evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to
punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.” Id. at 87. The First Circuit has held that
“[t]o establish a Brady violation, ‘a defendant must make three showings. The evidence at issue (whether exculpatory
or impeaching) must be favorable to the accused; that evidence must have been either willfully or inadvertently

             12. Claim that the case should not have been prosecuted in federal court

        Petitioner argues that his case should not have been prosecuted in federal court; he states,

“I still don’t know why my case out of 20 or so other pharmacy robberies went federal.” (ECF

No. 51-3 at 1.)

        “Congress and the Constitution have given the Executive Branch some prosecutorial

discretion as to when to prosecute. No such discretion is given to the Judicial Branch to invalidate

convictions on the basis of whether or not there have been few prosecutions on similar facts in the

past.” United States v. Cortés-Cabán, 691 F.3d 1, 22-23 (1st Cir. 2012). “Although the exercise

of prosecutorial discretion is subject to the constitutional guarantee of equal protection and ‘may

not be deliberately based upon an unjustifiable standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary

classification,’ the prosecutor is entitled to a threshold presumption that he acted in good faith for

reasons of sound governmental policy.” United States v. Gary, 74 F.3d 304, 313 (1st Cir. 1996)

(quoting Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 608 (1985)) (quotation marks and citations

omitted).

        In this case, Petitioner does not claim that the exercise of prosecutorial discretion to

prosecute him violates any law, and the record is devoid of any evidence that the prosecution was

conducted in bad faith. Petitioner’s claim thus is not cognizable in a section 2255 action. See 28

U.S.C. § 2255(a) (requiring that the claim assert that the prisoner is in custody under a sentence

imposed “in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States”). Furthermore, Petitioner

waived the claim, see Gary, 74 F.3d at 313, and it is procedurally defaulted.

424 (1st Cir.2011) (quoting United States v. Mathur, 624 F.3d 498, 503 (1st Cir.2010)) (quotation marks omitted).

             13. Claim based on Alleyne v. United States

         Petitioner states: “I was waiting to see if [Alleyne] became retroactive.” (Motion at 12.)

The First Circuit has held that “the rule announced in Alleyne is not retroactively applicable to

sentences on collateral review on an initial habeas petition.” Butterworth v. United States, 775

F.3d 459, 468 (1st Cir. 2015). Thus, Petitioner could not have had the benefit of Alleyne had it

applied to this case.15

                                              III.     CONCLUSION

         Based on the foregoing analysis, an evidentiary hearing is not warranted under Rule 8 of

the Rules Governing Section 2255 Cases. The recommendation is that the Court deny Petitioner’s

section 2255 motion, and deny a certificate of appealability pursuant to Rule 11 of the Rules

Governing Section 2255 Cases because there is no substantial showing of the denial of a

constitutional right within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).

         28 U.S.C. 636(b)(1)(B) for which de novo review by the district court is sought,

   In Alleyne v. United States, 133 S. Ct. 2151 (2013), the Supreme Court held that “any fact that increases the
mandatory minimum [sentence] is an ‘element’ that must be submitted to the jury.” 133 S.Ct. at 2155 (emphasis
added). The holding in Alleyne is recognized as an extension of the Court's holding in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530
U.S. 466 (2000). As the plurality explained in Alleyne, the Supreme Court held in Apprendi that “any fact that
increased the prescribed statutory maximum sentence must be an ‘element’ of the offense to be found by the jury.”
Alleyne, 133 S.Ct. at 2157 (emphasis added) (citing Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 483, n. 10, 490). Petitioner’s indictment
stated that he “knowingly used and carried a firearm” in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C.
§924(c)(1)(A). (Indictment, ECF No. 9 at 1-2.) Section 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) provides that “if the firearm is brandished,”
the defendant must be “sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years.” The prosecution version, which
Petitioner admitted was true, stated that he “pulled his shirt up, displaying a pistol.” (Prosecution Version, ECF No.
30 at 1.) The Court explained to Petitioner in the plea hearing that if it found at sentencing that Petitioner had
brandished the weapon, Petitioner would be subject to a mandatory additional term of seven years of imprisonment.
(Plea Tr., ECF No. 47 at 10-11.) Petitioner pled guilty knowing that he might receive the additional sentence for
brandishing the weapon. “[W]hen a defendant knowingly admits the facts necessary for a sentence enhancement in
the context of a plea, simultaneously waiving his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial, no Apprendi problem arises.”
United States v. Yancy, 725 F.3d 596, 601 (6th Cir. 2013). Thus, Alleyne would not have been applicable to this case
even if it had been retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.
