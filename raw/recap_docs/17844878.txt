                   UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                     DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS

Criminal No. 07-10365-JLT


                     UNITED STATES OF AMERICA


                                 v.


                         THEODORE AGUIRRE


                REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION RE:
       MOTION PURSUANT TO 28 U.S.C. § 2255 TO VACATE,
    SET ASIDE, OR CORRECT SENTENCE (DOCKET ENTRY # 109);
    REQUEST FOR EVIDENTIARY HEARING (DOCKET ENTRY # 120)

                        February 27, 2014

BOWLER, U.S.M.J.

     Pending before this court is a motion to vacate, set

aside or correct a sentence filed by defendant Theodore

Aguirre (“defendant”) pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255

(“section 2255”).    (Docket Entry # 109).       On January 14,

2014, the United States of America (“the government”) filed

an opposition to the motion.      (Docket Entry # 118).       Also

pending before this court is a motion for an evidentiary

hearing and for appointment of counsel filed by defendant.

(Docket Entry # 120).

                      PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

     The motion alleges one ground as a basis for vacating

the sentence.    Defendant claims that he should not have
    Case 1:07-cr-10365-IT Document 122 Filed 02/27/14 Page 2 of 18



been sentenced under 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B) (“Armed

Career Criminal Act” or “ACCA”).       Specifically, he submits

that his prior criminal history did not qualify him as an

Armed Career Criminal subject to a 15 year mandatory

minimum sentence in light of Descamps v. United States.

133 S.Ct. 2276 (2013).     Defendant also maintains that his

section 2255 challenge is not time barred because Descamps

was not decided until June 20, 2013, which is within the

one year limitation period for filing a section 2255

motion.   28 U.S.C. § 2255(f)(1).

     An evidentiary hearing is not required to resolve the

motion.   As discussed in greater detail below, even

accepting defendant’s nonconclusory statements of facts as

true to the extent not contradicted by the record,

defendant is not entitled to relief.        See David v. United

States, 134 F.3d 470, 477 (1st Cir. 1998) (setting forth

evidentiary hearing standard in section 2255 proceeding);

United States v. McGill, 11 F.3d 223, 225 (1st Cir. 1993)

(“court need not give weight to conclusory allegations”);

Myatt v. United States, 875 F.2d 8, 11 (1st Cir. 1989)

(hearing not necessary if section 2255 motion “is

‘conclusively refuted as to the alleged facts by the files

and records of the case’”).      Defendant fails in his burden

to establish the need for an evidentiary hearing.           See


	                                 2
     Case 1:07-cr-10365-IT Document 122 Filed 02/27/14 Page 3 of 18



United States v. McGill, 11 F.3d at 225 (recognizing that

petitioner bears burden of establishing need for

evidentiary hearing in section 2255 proceeding).           The

motion to vacate, together with the government’s filings

(Docket Entry ## 109 & 118) are therefore ripe for review.

      In addition to an evidentiary hearing, defendant seeks

appointment of counsel.       (Docket Entry #120).      There is no

constitutional right to appointment of counsel beyond the

direct appeal of a criminal conviction.          Swazo v. Wyoming

Department of Corrections State Penitentiary Warden, 23

F.3d 332, 333 (10th Cir. 1994); see Ellis v. U.S., 313 F.3d

636, 652 (1st Cir. 2002) (noting in section 2255 proceeding

that “convicted criminal has no constitutional right to

counsel with respect to habeas proceedings”); see also

Morin v. State of Rhode Island, 741 F.Supp. 32, 36 (D.R.I.

1990).   Rather, appointment of counsel in a collateral

attack on a criminal conviction is discretionary.1           Heath v.

United States Parole Commission, 788 F.2d 85, 88 (2nd Cir.

1986).   In particular, under 18 U.S.C. § 3006A(a)(2), a

court may appoint counsel for a “financially eligible

person seeking relief under section 2254 when the interests

																																																								
1	      Appointment of counsel, however, is mandatory where the
district court conducts an evidentiary hearing. See Rule
8(c), 28 U.S.C. foll. § 2255. As previously discussed, an
evidentiary hearing is not warranted.

of justice require.”        Battle v. Armontrout, 902 F.2d 701,

702 (8th Cir. 1990).

           The rare cases warranting appointment of counsel in

the interests of justice typically involve nonfrivolous

claims with factually and/or legally complex issues and a

petitioner who is severely hampered in his ability to

investigate the facts.        See United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d

1058, 1063-64 (1st Cir. 1993); Battle v. Armontrout, 902

F.2d at 702; see also Abdullah v. Norris, 18 F.3d 571; 573

(8th Cir. 1994).       As explained below, the section 2255

motion does not involve a nonfrivolous claim and neither

the facts nor the law is complex.          Defendant also fails to

make an adequate showing of financial eligibility.

                               BACKGROUND2

I.     FBI Investigation and Armed Career Criminal Status

           As part of a larger FBI investigation into gang

related firearms violence in Chelsea and Revere,

Massachusetts, defendant and two other individuals were

videotaped on two occasions selling assault rifles to a

Federal Bureau of Investigation cooperating witness in

																																																								
2					“A       section 2255 petition must be dismissed whenever ‘the
motion and the files and records of the case conclusively
show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.’” United
States v. Williams, 2012 WL 2149823, at *2 (D.Mass. March
22, 2012). The underlying facts are taken from the trial
transcripts. 	


	                                    4
    Case 1:07-cr-10365-IT Document 122 Filed 02/27/14 Page 5 of 18



August and September 2007.      As a result, defendant was

indicted on November 8, 2007, for being a felon in

possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. §

922(g)(1) (“section 922”).

     At the time of the Indictment, defendant had a prior

criminal history.    Past offenses included an adjudication

for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon3 and

convictions for armed assault with intent to murder and

assault with a dangerous weapon.       Defendant also had two

prior assault convictions.

     A defendant qualifies as an Armed Career Criminal

(“ACC”) if that individual has three previous convictions

by any court for a “violent felony” committed on occasions

different from one another.      18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1).       The

term “violent felony” includes any crime punishable by

imprisonment exceeding one year or “any act of juvenile

delinquency involving the use or carrying of a firearm,

knife, or destructive device that would be punishable by

imprisonment for such term if committed by an adult.”           18

U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(C).     In addition, qualification as a

“violent felony” under the applicable categorical approach

requires that the crime:

																																																								
3				Defendant committed the assault and battery with a

dangerous weapon at a time when he was a juvenile.


	                                 5
    Case 1:07-cr-10365-IT Document 122 Filed 02/27/14 Page 6 of 18



        (i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or
        threatened use of physical force against the person of
        another; or

        (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of
        explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that
        presents a serious potential risk of physical injury
        to another.

U.S. v. Mouscardy, 722 F.3d 68, 76 (1st Cir. 2013) (quoting

18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B) with internal brackets omitted).

        Defendant’s prior Massachusetts convictions for

assault with a dangerous weapon and armed assault with

intent to murder qualify as “violent” felonies under the

ACCA since the terms of imprisonment exceed one year and

they have the attempted use of physical force as an element

of the crime.    Armed assault with intent to murder carries

a punishment of imprisonment of up to ten years.          Mass.

Gen. L. ch. 265, § 15.     Similarly, assault with a dangerous

weapon carries a punishment of imprisonment exceeding one

year.    Mass. Gen. L. ch. 265, § 15B(b).       These prior

convictions include a serious risk of physical injury that

the ACCA is meant to incorporate as predicate offenses.

United States v. Carrigan, 724 F.3d 39, 51 (1st Cir. 2013)

(defendant’s prior conviction for assault and battery with

a deadly weapon categorically qualified as a violent felony

under the ACCA).    United States v. Sacko, 178 F.3d 1, 1-2

(1st Cir. 1999) (armed assault with intent to murder is a



	                                 6
      Case 1:07-cr-10365-IT Document 122 Filed 02/27/14 Page 7 of 18



“violent felony” because it involves serious risk of

physical force under 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)).

       Similarly, a prior juvenile adjudication for assault

and battery with a dangerous weapon qualifies as a

predicate conviction under the ACCA.          A “conviction” under

the ACCA “includes a finding that a person has committed an

act of juvenile delinquency involving a violent felony”

that would be punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year

if committed by an adult.        18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(C); United

States v. Hart, 674 F.3d 33, 41 (1st Cir. 2012) (assault and

battery with dangerous weapon is a “violent felony” under

the ACCA); Commonwealth v. Smith, 829 N.E.2d 1090, 1091

(Mass. 2005) (term of imprisonment for assault and battery

with dangerous weapon exceeds one year).

II.    Plea Agreement and Subsequent Proceedings

       On February 8, 2010, the parties entered into a

binding plea agreement.        (Docket Entry # 69).      In return

for the government’s agreement to dismiss the Indictment,

defendant agreed to plead to two counts of unlawful

possession of a stolen firearm in violation of section

922(j) charged in an Information and agreed to a sentence

of 151 months incarceration.        (Docket Entry # 69).       As an

ACC, defendant initially faced a mandatory minimum sentence

of 180 months in prison.        The plea agreement included a


	                                   7
     Case 1:07-cr-10365-IT Document 122 Filed 02/27/14 Page 8 of 18



“Waiver of Right to Appeal and to Bring Other Challenge”

provision.      The provision stated in relevant part,

“Defendant agrees that he will not seek to be re-sentenced

with the benefit of any change to the criminal history

category that existed at the time of Defendant’s original

sentencing.”       (Docket Entry # 69).          He also waived his

right to file a section 2255 motion.4               (Docket Entry # 69).

      On May 3, 2010, the court accepted the plea agreement

and imposed a 151 month sentence.              The government

subsequently made a motion to dismiss the Indictment, which

the court allowed.         On May 19, 2010, the court issued an

amended judgment.        (Docket Entry # 82).

      On August 30, 2013, defendant filed the section 2255

motion.     (Docket Entry # 109).           Defendant claims he did not

have the necessary predicates to be sentenced under the

Armed Career Criminal Act in light of Descamps v. United

States, 133 S.Ct. 2276 (2013).              (Docket Entry # 110).

                                  DISCUSSION
																																																								
4				The relevant language reads as follows:


      Defendant also understands that he may, in some
      circumstances, be able to challenge his conviction in
      a future proceeding (such as, for example, in a
      collateral challenge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 or
      28 U.S.C. § 2241). Defendant waives any right he has
      to challenge his conviction on direct appeal or in any
      future proceeding.

(Docket Entry # 69).

I.   Section 2255 Review

      Section 2255 provides for post-conviction relief:               (1)

“that the sentence was imposed in violation of the

Constitution or laws of the United States”; (2) “that the

court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence”;

(3) “that the sentence was in excess of the maximum

authorized by law”; or (4) that the sentence “is otherwise

subject to collateral attack.”            Damon v. United States, 731

F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2013); see David v. United States, 134

F.3d 470, 474 (1st Cir. 1998) (citing Hill v. United States,

368 U.S. 424, 426-27 (1962)).            The fourth category includes

only “assignments of error that reveal ‘fundamental

defects’ which, if uncorrected, will ‘result in a complete

miscarriage of justice,’ or irregularities that are

‘inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair

procedure.’”    David v. United States, 134 F.3d at 474;

accord Damon, 732 F.3d at 3.         Stated otherwise, “apart from

claims of constitutional or jurisdictional nature, a

cognizable section 2255 claim must reveal ‘exceptional

circumstances’ that make the need for redress evident.”

David, 134 F.3d at 474.

      Defendant bears the burden of establishing the need

for section 2255 relief.       Id.       Specifically, a defendant

must establish that his sentence was imposed in violation


	                                    9
      Case 1:07-cr-10365-IT Document 122 Filed 02/27/14 Page 10 of 18



of the Constitution or the laws of the United States

involving a “fundamental defect which inherently results in

a complete miscarriage of justice” or “an omission

inconsistent with rudimentary demands of fair procedure.”

Hill v. United States, 368 U.S. at 426-27.            To obtain

relief under section 2255, petitioner “must clear a

significantly higher hurdle that would exist on direct

appeal.”     United States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 166 (1982).

II.    Timeliness of Section 2255 Motion

       Section 2255(f) imposes a one year limitation period

for section 2255 motions.        Where, as here, a defendant does

not file a direct appeal, the judgment becomes final when

the time to file a notice of appeal expires.            See Murphy v.

United States, 634 F.3d 1303, 1307 (11th Cir. 2011).              The

statutory subsection reads as follows:

       A 1-year period of limitations shall apply to a motion
       under this section. The limitation period shall run
       from the latest of--

             (1)   the date on which the judgment of conviction
                   becomes final;

             (2)   the date on which the impediment to making a
                   motion created by governmental action in
                   violation of the Constitution or laws of the
                   Unites States is removed, if the movant was
                   prevented from making a motion by such
                   governmental action;

             (3)   the date on which the right asserted was
                   initially recognized by the Supreme Court,
                   if that right has been newly recognized by


	                                   10
    Case 1:07-cr-10365-IT Document 122 Filed 02/27/14 Page 11 of 18



                   the Supreme Court and made retroactively
                   applicable to cases on collateral review; or

             (4)   the date on which the facts supporting the
                   claim or claims presented could have been
                   discovered through the exercise of due
                   diligence.

28 U.S.C. § 2255(1)-(4).

        With respect to subparagraph one, the court issued an

amended judgment on May 19, 2010.        (Docket Entry # 82).

Defendant had 14 days from the date of the amended judgment

to file a notice of appeal.       See Fed. R. App. P. 4(b)(1)(A)

(2010).    As a result, under subparagraph one, defendant

became ineligible to file a section 2255 motion on June 2,

2011, one year from the date that the judgment became final

under section 2255(f)(1).      The dates described in

subparagraphs two5 and four6 do not apply.         Under

subparagraph three, however, defendant asserts that the

recent Supreme Court ruling in Descamps v. United States,

133 S.Ct. 2276 (2013), constitutes a newly recognized right

and the one year time period therefore begins to run at the

time of the decision on June 20, 2013.         (Docket Entry #

110).

																																																								
5				Defendant does not allege that he was prevented from

filing the section 2255 motion due to governmental action.
(Docket Entry # 110). 	
6				Defendant does not allege that he was unable to file the

section 2255 motion due to undiscovered facts. (Docket
Entry # 110). 	


	                                 11
    Case 1:07-cr-10365-IT Document 122 Filed 02/27/14 Page 12 of 18



        The Court in Descamps ruled that because the crime of

burglary was defined more broadly by California’s statute

than “generic burglary,” that crime could not serve as an

Armed Career Criminal predicate.         Id. at 2285.    Pursuant to

the Court’s ruling in Descamps, defendant asserts that his

juvenile adjudication and his two adult assault convictions

no longer count as ACC predicates.         The government first

contends that defendant was not sentenced as an ACC by

accepting the plea agreement.          (Docket Entry # 118).

Second, even if defendant was sentenced as an ACC, the

government argues that both convictions defendant contests

constitute “violent felonies” within the meaning of the

ACCA.

        The Massachusetts statutes that defendant argues no

longer serve as ACCA predicates are wholly unlike the

California statute in Descamps.          First, the Massachusetts

juvenile adjudication for assault and battery with a

dangerous weapon does not broaden the statutory definition

of the crime more so than generic assault and battery with

a dangerous weapon.     Mass. Gen. L. ch. 265, § 15A(b)(i).

Generic assault and battery with a dangerous weapon

constitutes a felony in Massachusetts that is punishable by

two and a half years imprisonment.         Hart, 674 F.3d at 41.

Defendant’s juvenile adjudication for assault and battery


	                                 12
    Case 1:07-cr-10365-IT Document 122 Filed 02/27/14 Page 13 of 18



with a dangerous weapon is punishable by a term of

imprisonment exceeding one year and qualifies as an ACCA

predicate.   Mass. Gen. L. ch. 265, § 15A(b)(i); United

States v. Ellis, 619 F.3d 72, 73 (1st Cir. 2010)

(defendant’s prior juvenile adjudication for assault and

battery with handgun qualified as an ACCA predicate

conviction); Hart, 674 F.3d at 41 (adult assault and

battery with a dangerous weapon qualified as an ACCA

predicate offense); United States v. Matthews, WL 1912393,

at *1 (D.Mass. June 29, 2009) (ACCA “defines violent felony

to include any act of juvenile delinquency involving the

use or carrying of a firearm, knife, or destructive

device”).7

     In light of the above, defendant has three predicate

offenses, i.e., the juvenile adjudication, the assault with

a dangerous weapon conviction and the armed assault with

intent to murder conviction.       Whether defendant’s

additional convictions for assault no longer qualify as

ACCA predicate offenses under Descamps is therefore

immaterial to defendant’s status as an ACC.          Out of an

abundance of caution, this court nevertheless examines the

assault convictions in light of Descamps.

																																																								
7				The presentence report depicts the “charge” as “Assault &

Battery by Dang Weapon (Knife).”


	                                 13
    Case 1:07-cr-10365-IT Document 122 Filed 02/27/14 Page 14 of 18



     Defendant maintains that his previous convictions for

assault do not constitute “violent felonies” under the ACCA

in light of Descamps.      Under both theories of common law

assault, attempted battery or threatened battery, the crime

involves the use, attempted use or threatened use of

physical force against another person within the meaning of

U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B).      The statutory crime of assault is

similarly divided into these two categories.          Mass. Gen. L.

ch. 265, § 13A.    Assault may be committed either by

attempted or achieving a battery, “or by engaging in

objectively menacing conduct so as to place another in

reasonable apprehension of an immediately threatened

battery.”   Parreira v. Commonwealth, 971 N.E.2d. 242, 248

(Mass. 2012).    The crime of assault is punishable by

imprisonment of two and a half years in Massachusetts.

Mass. Gen. L. ch. 265, § 13A.          Because assault involves

either attempted or threatened use of physical force and

carries the possibility of imprisonment exceeding one year,

it qualifies as a “violent felony” within the meaning of

the ACCA.   Thus, Descamps does not provide defendant a

“newly recognized” right that triggers the running of the

one year limitation period on June 20 2013, the date the

Court decided Descamps.      Defendant’s conviction therefore




	                                 14
    Case 1:07-cr-10365-IT Document 122 Filed 02/27/14 Page 15 of 18



become final on June 2, 2010, and the one year period ended

on June 2, 2011, under section 2255(f)(1).

     The doctrine of equitable tolling does not apply.

Equitable tolling “provides that in exceptional

circumstances, a statute of limitations ‘may be extended

for equitable reasons not acknowledged in the statute

creating the limitations period.’”        Neverson v.

Farquharson, 366 F.3d 32, 40 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting David

v. Hall, 318 F.3d 343, 345-46 (1st Cir. 2003)).          Equitable

tolling, however, is available only when “circumstances

beyond the litigant’s control have prevented [him] from

promptly fiing.”     Cordle v. Guarino, 428 F.3d 46, 48 (1st

Cir. 2005).    Defendant bears the burden of establishing the

basis for equitable tolling.       Ramos-Martinez v. United

States, 638 F.3d 315, 323 (1st 2011).        To carry this burden,

defendant must show, “(1) that he has been pursuing his

rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary

circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.”

Holland v. Florida 560 U.S. 631, 649 (2010).

     This is not an appropriate case for such tolling.

Defendant has not been pursuing his rights diligently nor

was he prevented from filing the section 2255 motion

because of any extraordinary circumstance beyond his

control.   Upon entering a plea agreement and receiving an

amended judgment from the court on May 19, 2010, defendant

filed no notice of appeal.         It took defendant three years

from the time of the final judgment to file the instant

collateral challenge.        Such a time lapse does not

constitute “pursuing [defendant’s] rights diligently.”                Id.

As the court noted in Ramos-Martinez, “equitable tolling is

not intended as a device to rescue those who inexcusably

sleep upon their rights.”        Ramos-Martinez, 638 F.3d at 323-

24.

III.    Waiver

       In the alternative, the government correctly maintains

that defendant explicitly waived the right to appeal or

collaterally attack the sentence.          (Docket Entry # 118).

The right to appeal or collaterally attack a sentence can

be waived and a presentence waiver is enforceable.             United

States v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14, 23 (1st Cir. 2001).             Like any

waiver of rights, such an agreement must be entered into

knowingly and voluntarily.         United States v. Teeter, 257

F.3d at 24.      If the waiver is made knowingly and

voluntarily, it is presumptively valid.           Id. at 25.     If

waiver of appellate rights would work a miscarriage of

justice, however, an appellate court may refuse to honor

the waiver.      Id.; see United States v. Isum, 580 F.3d 43,

50 (1st Cir. 2009).

     In the context of a plea bargain, the plea agreement

and Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 (“Rule 11”) colloquy are “critically

important” in determining whether a waiver was knowing and

voluntary.   Id. at 24.     The written plea agreement must

contain “a clear statement” setting forth a waiver of

appellate rights and its scope.        Id.   At a change of plea

hearing, the court must inquire specifically “into any

waiver of appellate rights.”       Id.   Such an inquiry “offers

considerable assurance” that a waiver was made knowingly

and voluntarily.     Id.   A reviewing court must examine the

transcript of the Rule 11 hearing to determine whether the

court’s interrogation of the defendant demonstrates that

the waiver was made freely and intelligently.          Id.   Failure

to question the defendant regarding the waiver may

invalidate it if the defendant did not understand the

significance of the waiver or was prejudiced.          Id. at 27.

     The plea agreement between the parties demonstrates

that defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right

to appeal or collaterally attack the sentence.           As an ACC,

defendant faced a mandatory minimum sentence of 180 months

in prison.   The plea agreement, however, only imposed a 151

month sentence.    In the written plea agreement signed by

defendant, defendant expressly waived the right to appeal

or collaterally attack the conviction.         (Docket Entry #


	                                 17
    Case 1:07-cr-10365-IT Document 122 Filed 02/27/14 Page 18 of 18



69).    The agreement additionally specified that it was the

only agreement between the parties.        (Docket Entry # 69).

The language was clear and unambiguous both as to the

waiver of defendant’s right to file a future section 2255

motion challenging the conviction and the wavier of his

ability to seek re-sentencing based on a change to his

criminal history category.       As such, defendant explicitly

waived the right to appeal or collaterally attack the

conviction and the sentence once the court accepted the

plea and issued a final amended judgment.

                             CONCLUSION

       Based on the foregoing reasons, this court RECOMMENDS8

that the section 2255 motion (Docket Entry # 265) be

DENIED.    The motion for an evidentiary hearing and

appointment of counsel (Docket Entry # 120) is DENIED.
