                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE




United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 07-cr-52-PB

Bienvenido Jerez


                                  O R D E R


     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

April 3, 2007 trial in the above case, citing the need for

additional time to finalize a negotiated plea agreement.                 The

government does not object to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reason and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from April 3, 2007 to May 1, 2007.             In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
