       WHEREAS, in addition to specifying certain forfeitable property in the Indictment, the

                                                 3

United States also filed two forfeiture bills of particulars in this case, specifying additional property

that would be subject to forfeiture upon defendants’ convictions;

        WHEREAS, on October 26, 2009, Defendant pled guilty to all of the charges against him

in the Indictment, tendering his guilty plea pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C) and a written

plea agreement, in which Defendant agreed to forfeit "any and all assets subject to forfeiture

pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 853 and 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1) as a result of his guilty plea," including,

without limitation, all assets identified as forfeitable in the Indictment's Drug Forfeiture Allegation

and Money Laundering Forfeiture Allegation and all assets identified in the two forfeiture bills of

particulars;

        WHEREAS, the Court found a sufficient factual basis for Defendant's plea, and that

Defendant was pleading knowingly, intentionally, and voluntarily, but because the plea was tendered

under Rule 11(c)(1)(C), the Court deferred acceptance of Defendant’s plea pending review of the

Pre-Sentence Report;

        WHEREAS, the United States has moved for entry of a preliminary order of forfeiture as to

the Escalade, the 59 Bloomfield Street Property, and the small amount of money restrained by order

of the Court in Defendant’s Bank of America Account No. 0095-1870-6236, and has provided a

sufficient legal and factual basis for direct forfeiture of these assets;

        WHEREAS, the United States in this case also qualifies for an order forfeiting substitute

assets because, due to acts and omissions of Defendant and his co-conspirator defendants, including

their having spent and/or transferred the original drug proceeds to purchase, among other things,

new supplies of marijuana, expensive jewelry, luxury homes in Florida (one of which was

subsequently sold to a third party, and the other of which apparently has no current value), and


                                                   4

numerous vehicles, the original gross drug proceeds are no longer available for forfeiture, and the

government, despite diligent efforts, has not been able to locate most of the gross proceeds of the

marijuana trafficking conspiracy;

        WHEREAS, in light of this Court’s acceptance of Defendant’s guilty plea, convicting him

on Counts One, Four through Eleven, and Seventeen of the Indictment, the United States is now

entitled to the requested order forfeiting the listed assets;

ACCORDINGLY, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED:

        1.       The Court finds, pursuant to Rule 32.2(b) and (e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal

Procedure, that the government has established the required connections between the assets sought

to be forfeited directly and the offenses of which the Defendant has been convicted, and that the

government has also satisfied 21 U.S.C. § 853(p) and therefore established its entitlement to

forfeiture of substitute assets. Accordingly, the following property (collectively, the “Forfeited

Property”) is hereby forfeited to the United States of America pursuant to 21 U.S.C. §§ 853(a) and

(p), 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1), and 28 U.S.C. § 2461(c):

                 A.     2003 Cadillac Escalade, VIN 1GYEK63N73R286773;

                 B.     The real property located at 59 Bloomfield Street, Dorchester (a section of

        Boston), Suffolk County, Massachusetts, consisting of two parcels with all buildings and

        improvements thereon and all rights appertaining thereto, including, but not limited to, a

        two-family home bearing the addresses “57" and “59" Bloomfield Street, title to which

        appears at Book 34895, pages 122-123, of the Suffolk County, Massachusetts, Registry of

        Deeds;

        4.      Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 853(n) and Rule 32.2(b)(6), the United States shall give, to

the extent practicable, direct written notice to any person who reasonably appears to be a potential

claimant with standing to contest the forfeiture of the Forfeited Property.

        5.      Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 853(n)(2) and (3), the notice referred to above shall state: (a)

that any person, other than the Defendant, asserting a legal interest in the Forfeited Property, shall,

within thirty (30) days of the final publication of the notice or that person’s receipt of direct written

notice, whichever is earlier, file a petition with the United States District Court in Boston,

Massachusetts, requesting a hearing to adjudicate the validity of his or her interest in the Forfeited

Property; (b) that the petition shall be signed by the petitioner under the penalty of perjury and shall

provided in 21 U.S.C. § 853(n)(2) for the filing of such petitions, the United States of America shall

have clear title to the Forfeited Property.

       7.      Pursuant to Rule 32.2(b)(4) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, this

preliminary Order of Forfeiture will become final as to Defendant at the time of his sentencing, will

be part of Defendant’s criminal sentence, and will be included in the criminal judgment entered by
