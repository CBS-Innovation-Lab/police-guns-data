                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 08-cr-142-PB

Kyle Kimball



                                  O R D E R

     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

trial scheduled for May 5, 2009, citing the need for additional

time to complete discovery, engage in plea negotiations and

prepare for trial.       The government does not object to a

continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reasons and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from May 5, 2009 to July 7, 2009.             In agreeing

to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ยง

3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the ends of

justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the best

interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
