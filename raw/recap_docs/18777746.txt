                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE




United States of America

     v.                                         Case No. 05-cr-206-01-PB

Danny Rivera


                                  O R D E R


     The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

June 6, 2006 trial in the above case, citing the need for

additional time to investigate the allegations contained in a

superceding indictment which the government is currently seeking

against the defendant.       The government does not object to a

continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, in order to allow the parties additional time

to complete discovery on the new charges and properly prepare for

trial, the court will continue the trial from June 6, 2006 to

July 6, 2006.      In agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds

pursuant to 18 U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated

reasons, the ends of justice served in granting a continuance

outweigh the best interests of the public and the defendant in a

speedy trial.

      The court will hold a final pretrial conference on June 28,

2006 at 3:45 p.m.

      SO ORDERED.
