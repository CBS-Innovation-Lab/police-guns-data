                        ORDER ON PENDING MOTIONS


1.    Notice of Appeal and Objections to Magistrate [Judge] Cohen’s Denial of
      Motions and to His Participation in General (Docket Items 148, 154)

      The objections are OVERRULED. Magistrate Judge Cohen is acting within his

statutory authority, 28 U.S.C. § 636 (2000), and the Local Rules of this Court. The

rulings he has made on nondispositive matters are neither clearly erroneous nor

contrary to law.    Fed. R. Crim. P. 59(a).       On Judge Cohen’s dispositive

recommendations, I have made an independent de novo review, and I adopt his

conclusions in the Memorandum Decision and Order on Motions to Compel

Production and Recommended Decision on Motion to Dismiss (Docket Item 133) as

my own. Fed. R. Crim. P. 59(b). I also reject specifically the defendant’s argument

that he can bring about the recusal of the Magistrate Judge by the defendant’s own

statements and behavior:
Case 2:06-cr-00025-DBH Document 164 Filed 09/05/06 Page 2 of 11               PageID #: 576



              [C]ertain colloquy between the Accused and the magistrate have
              embroiled the magistrate (even though he has attempted to hide
              this fact) which gives an appearance of impropriety and on these
              grounds alone is reason to step down. The very fact that J. Hornby
              made the statement at the end of an order, and was made part of
              the record, that the Accused is “anti-Semitic” clearly is reason
              enough for magistrate Cohen to recuse, even though this statement
              is not true there is still an “appearance of impropriety.”


Objections at 3 (emphasis original). What I said was: “the defendant has begun

making anti-Semitic utterances against Judge Cohen . . . . I will not tolerate either

anti-Semitism or any contemptuous behavior. Any further documents that the

defendant sends to the Court that contain anti-Semitic utterances will be STRICKEN

IN   THEIR ENTIRETY.” United States v. Friel, 2006 WL 1793556,*2-3 (D. Me. 2006).

Presumably the defendant’s reference to a “colloquy” between the defendant and

the Magistrate Judge refers to a closed ex parte hearing conducted by the

Magistrate Judge on June 6, 2006, concerning the defendant’s relationship with

the standby counsel the court appointed in light of the defendant’s insistence on

proceeding without a lawyer. At that hearing, the defendant made an outrageous

and unconscionable statement when the Magistrate Judge recessed the proceeding.

Ex Parte Hearing Tr. 15:2, June 6, 2006 (Docket Item 109). Because the hearing

was closed, I will not quote the statement. But the suggestion that Judge Cohen

has “attempted to hide” what happened is ludicrous. It is a matter of record. Parties

are not permitted to make outrageous statements against a judge and then use

their own statements as a basis for recusal. F.D.I.C. v. Sweeney, 136 F.3d 216, 219-




                                                                                          2

20 (1st Cir. 1998); 13A Charles Alan Wright, et al., Federal Practice and Procedure

§ 3542 at 577-78 ( 2d ed. 1984).

2.     Motion for a Grand Jury Transcript of Indictment Proceedings of the
       Accused, and Reporter’s Notes (Docket Item 120)

       The motion is DENIED. The defendant has shown no reason under Fed. R.

Crim. P. 6(e) to justify disclosure. The assertions that “[t]he Accused took a ‘general

census’ of the grand jury and believed they were not going to indict him,” that “[t]he

Accused saw at least 10 questionable—as far as legally qualified—grand jurors and

needs a transcript in order to determine from questions asked and answers given if

there was indeed at least 12 qualified grand jurors that voted to indict him,” and

that “[t]he Accused also needs to know what the prosecution told them after the

Accused left the room” are not sufficient. See, e.g., United States v. Young, 955 F.2d

99, 107-8 (1st Cir. 1992) (no access to grand jury minutes required upon mere

assertion of prosecutorial vindictiveness); United States v. Orbiz, 513 F.2d 816, 818-

19 (1st Cir. 1975) (access requires “showing that some possible grounds for

dismissal would be produced,” “sufficient promise,” “particularized need”).

3.     Motion to Suppress and Request for Evidentiary Hearing (Franks v.
       Delaware) and Request for Oral Argument (Docket Item 108)

     The defendant moves to suppress evidence growing out of a search of his

residence pursuant to a warrant. He also asks for a Franks evidentiary hearing

(Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978)), and for oral argument. He advances the

following bases:


                                                                                      3
Case 2:06-cr-00025-DBH Document 164 Filed 09/05/06 Page 4 of 11          PageID #: 578



           (1)    The state judge who signed the search warrant was not

     neutral and detached, because previously “he had kicked the Accused

     out of his courtroom for calling him a liar.” Mot. to Suppress at 1. The

     defendant says that technical errors in the warrant also demonstrate

     that the state judge failed to perform his neutral and detached role;

           (2)    The affidavit in support of the warrant fails to show

     probable cause, particularly in failing to show credibility or reliability of

     confidential or anonymous informants or in having other corroboration;

           (3)    The affidavit lacks particularity in referring to the place to

     be searched or who was to be arrested;

           (4)    The search exceeded the scope of the warrant, first in the

     seizure of a weapon near the defendant’s bed, whereas the marijuana

     was downstairs in the defendant’s office, and second in extending the

     search to premises in the same building that belonged to the

     defendant’s adult son;

           (5)    The assertions in the affidavit were false and thus provided

     neither probable cause for the search nor justification for a no-knock

     nighttime search;

           (6)    The police conducting the search did not show the

     defendant the warrant and interrogated him with a gun to his head and

     without administering Miranda rights.


                                                                                     4
Case 2:06-cr-00025-DBH Document 164 Filed 09/05/06 Page 5 of 11                       PageID #: 579



       The motion and requests are DENIED.

       First, the defendant has made no showing sufficient to justify a Franks

evidentiary hearing on the truth of the affidavit that generated the warrant. The

defendant’s motion contains only the defendant’s unsworn assertions, many of

them concerning matters of which he has no personal knowledge.1 “A Franks

hearing is required only if the defendant makes a ‘substantial preliminary showing

(1) that a false statement in the affidavit has been made knowingly and

intentionally, and (2) that the false statement is necessary for the finding of

probable cause.” The defendant’s offer of proof must be “more than conclusory”; it

“should be supported by ‘[a]ffidavits or sworn or otherwise reliable statements of

witnesses.” United States v. Scalia, 993 F.2d 984, 986-87 (1st Cir. 1993). The

defendant has satisfied none of those requirements.

       Second, there is no showing that the state judge failed to perform his

reviewing function in a neutral and detached manner.                      Even if the judge had

previously disciplined the defendant for courtroom conduct (there is nothing but the

defendant’s unsworn assertion that this is so), that previous judicial ruling does not

prevent the judge from acting in further matters concerning the defendant. See

United States v. Young, 877 F.2d 1099, 1104 (1st Cir. 1989) (previous action by state



1 Just as I do not credit the defendant’s unsworn assertions, I do not credit the evidentiary assertions
in the government’s objection that are not contained in the affidavit and warrant. See, e.g., the
description of what allegedly happened at the time of the search. Gov’t Objection at 3 (Docket Item
145).


                                                                                                      5
Case 2:06-cr-00025-DBH Document 164 Filed 09/05/06 Page 6 of 11         PageID #: 580



judge “does not seem to us to have any significant bearing on [his] disinterest when

he considered the warrant application”). The alleged technical errors either do not

exist or are irrelevant. The provision that “This warrant may be executed during

daytime or nighttime hours of 9:00 PM to 7:00 AM” is not internally inconsistent; it

means simply that the warrant can be executed during the daytime, or it can be

executed during the nighttime, defined as 9:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. The assertion that

“[t]his residence is personally known to your affiant who will accompany other

officers during the execution of this search warrant” should not have been contained

in the Warrant, but it is a harmless transposition from the description contained in

the affidavit.

      Third, the affidavit was sufficiently particular in describing the premises to be

searched, namely the defendant’s residence, with address. Because it was not an

arrest warrant, it did not need to refer to who, if anyone, was to be arrested. The

defendant’s assertion that his adult son had property rights in a portion of the

premises has no effect. If items were improperly seized on someone else’s property,

it is that person who has the right to object, not this defendant. In his reply, the

defendant says that his reference to his son’s property rights in the building was

only to demonstrate that the Affiant lacked familiarity with his residence. Def.’s

Reply to Gov’t Response to the Accused Mot. to Suppress the Evid. and to Have a

Franks Hr’g (Docket Item 152) at 12. Even so, the affidavit provided probable cause

to search the identified premises, and the Warrant was sufficiently particularized.


                                                                                     6
Case 2:06-cr-00025-DBH Document 164 Filed 09/05/06 Page 7 of 11                     PageID #: 581



       Fourth, although the affidavit did not provide the state judge with specific

information about the two unidentified informants’ reliability and veracity, the

“totality of the circumstances,” Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 214 (1983),

demonstrated probable cause. The first informant was an anonymous caller to a

recorded hotline at the state drug enforcement agency. The second informant,

although not named, was facing criminal drug charges and spoke to a detective at

the Sheriff’s Office. “[A]n informant’s tip can establish probable cause even though

the affidavit does not contain information about the informant’s past reliability.”

United States v. Greenburg, 410 F.3d 63, 67 (1st Cir. 2005). Here, each informant

independently provided first-hand specificity and detail about what he saw in the

defendant’s household,2 see United States v. Taylor, 985 F.2d 3, 6 (1st Cir. 1993);

Greenburg, 410 F.3d at 67; their statements were generally consistent with each

other;3 and the informant facing criminal charges and seeking favorable police

treatment in return for cooperation had an incentive to provide truthful information

so as to receive that favorable treatment.              He also implicated himself in the

information he provided.           See Greenburg, 410 F.3d at 67-68.                  Finally, law

enforcement’s knowledge of previous trafficking activities by the defendant provided


2 For example, the presence of baggies, scales, and marijuana; the location of the materials as being
in the defendant’s office at the residence; and in one case, the general layout of the house.
3 Independently, each informant specified marijuana as the controlled substance in question,

referred to its location in the defendant’s office (in one case, the reference was to a room “where
there was a large desk”), and described the presence of scales and plastic baggies. (Whether there

                                                                                                   7
Case 2:06-cr-00025-DBH Document 164 Filed 09/05/06 Page 8 of 11                       PageID #: 582



additional context for a probable cause determination.4 In the end, the standard is

whether the totality of the circumstances demonstrated “a fair probability that

contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular case.” United States

v. Barnard, 299 F.3d 90, 93 (1st Cir. 2002), quoting United States v. Zayas-Diaz, 95

F.3d 105, 111 (1st Cir. 1996), quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238 (1983).

Relevant factors in the absence of specific information about credibility and veracity

of informants are whether the provided information “indicates first-hand

knowledge,” Barnard, 299 F.3d at 93, whether it is derived from informants’

personal observation rather than hearsay, United States v. Caggiano, 899 F.2d 99,

103 (1st Cir. 1990); Gates, 462 U.S. at 234, whether there is corroboration (as here

between the two informants), Barnard, 299 F.3d at 94-95, the role of a criminal

background check, id. at 95, and whether police met with the informant (as they did

here with the second cooperating informant) such that they knew his identity and

could hold him responsible if he provided false information, Greenburg, 410 F.3d at

67. Taking all these factors into account, and giving due deference to the review by

the judge issuing the warrant, Barnard, 299 F.3d at 93, I conclude that probable

cause existed.




were “two scales” (first informant) or a “set of scales” (second informant) does not destroy this
consistency.)
4 The assertion that copies of the defendant’s convictions were attached to the Affidavit appears to be

incorrect, but their absence does not remove probable cause, the officer having detailed the previous
convictions and sworn that he found them in a criminal history check through NCIC and SBI.


                                                                                                     8
Case 2:06-cr-00025-DBH Document 164 Filed 09/05/06 Page 9 of 11          PageID #: 583



      Fifth, the Supreme Court’s recent decision, Hudson v. Michigan, 126 S. Ct.

2159 (2006), makes clear that any violation of the constitutional knock-and-

announce requirement does not justify suppression if the evidence was the product

of a search pursuant to a warrant. That is the case here.

      Sixth, the location of the seized weapon does not justify suppression. (The

defendant asserts that it was upstairs by his bed, whereas the controlled substance

was downstairs in his office.) The Warrant identified the scope of the search as the

entire residence.    Thus, the officers were entitled to search for drugs in the

bedroom. It is true that the portion of the warrant dealing with property “to be

seized” spoke of “[f]irearms, ammunition or other devices . . . which are found in

proximity to” drugs, drug paraphernalia, and related business records. (Contrary to

the defendant’s argument, the Warrant spoke of “proximity,” not “close proximity.”

The latter phrase appeared in the affidavit, not in the Warrant.) But the affidavit

also made clear that the police knew that the defendant was a felon previously

convicted of both drug trafficking charges and illegal possession of a firearm.

Therefore, once law enforcement reached the head of defendant’s bed pursuant to a

search warrant that included the entire residence, they were entitled to seize the

weapon in “plain view,” because given the defendant’s status as a felon, it was illegal

for him to possess the firearm and, therefore, it was reasonable for them to believe

that the gun was evidence of a crime. United States v. Jones, 187 F.3d at 220.

“‘Plain view’ seizures are lawful if (1) the seizing police officer lawfully reached the


                                                                                      9
Case 2:06-cr-00025-DBH Document 164 Filed 09/05/06 Page 10 of 11                PageID #: 584



position from which he could see the item in plain view; (2) the seizure satisfied the

probable cause standard; and (3) the seizing officer had a ‘lawful right of access to

the object itself.’” United States v. Antrim, 389 F.3d 276, 283 (1st Cir. 2004), quoting

United States v. Jones, 187 F.3d 210, 221.

       Seventh, the defendant has provided no authority for suppressing evidence

discovered pursuant to a warrant merely because the police did not show the

defendant the warrant (assuming that his assertion to that effect is true). In fact,

the law is contrary to the defendant’s position. United States v. Antrim, 389 F.3d at

282.

       Eighth, since the government says that the defendant was not interrogated at

his residence, I conclude that it does not have any statements made by the

defendant during the search that it intends to use against him. Therefore, the

voluntariness of any such statements (if they occurred) and the failure to administer

Miranda warnings (Miranda v. Arizona, 86 U.S. 1602 (1966)) at that time are

irrelevant on this motion to suppress evidence that was seized pursuant to the

Warrant.5 Obviously, should the government attempt to use anything the defendant

said during the search, I would have to examine whether the defendant has any

Miranda or voluntariness arguments to prevent the government’s doing so.




5In his Reply, the defendant adds that the Maine State Police Tactical Team was used during the
search without explicit authorization in the warrant itself. That fact has no bearing on the
constitutionality of the search and the admissibility of what was discovered and seized.


                                                                                            10
Case 2:06-cr-00025-DBH Document 164 Filed 09/05/06 Page 11 of 11     PageID #: 585



      As a result, the defendant’s motion to suppress and his request for an

evidentiary are DENIED.

      The request for oral argument is DENIED. The defendant has had more than

sufficient opportunity to argue his motion, including permission to file a 32-page

Reply Memorandum that I have read and considered.
