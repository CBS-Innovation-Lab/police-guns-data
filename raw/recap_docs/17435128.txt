          ORDER ON DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO HAVE PROBATION
          OFFICER ABIDE BY SUPERVISED RELEASE CONDITIONS


        The issue here is whether I should order the Probation Office to permit

Dennis Friel to use “medical marijuana” while he is on supervised release. For

the reasons that follow, I decline to do so.

                                   BACKGROUND

        After a jury convicted Mr. Friel of both possession of a firearm by a felon

and possession with intent to distribute marijuana, I sentenced him in 2006 to

48 months in prison, followed by a period of supervised release of two years.

Friel was released from prison and entered on supervised release on October 2,

2009.

        Since his release on supervision, Friel has been attempting, without

success, to get permission from his supervising officer to use marijuana. As a

result, he filed a motion for clarification and requested a hearing on the

Probation Office’s interpretation of his terms of supervised release. See Letter

Motion to have Probation Officer Abide by Supervised Release Conditions

(Docket Item 260). I conducted such a hearing on March 26, 2010. At the

hearing, supervising Probation Officer Bryce Turgeon testified, as did Friel.

                                      ANALYSIS

      Friel has obtained a prescription for marijuana from a Maine physician.

He claims that he is entitled to use marijuana both because his existing terms

of supervised release permit his use and because Maine recently enacted

medical marijuana provisions.

      Friel’s conditions of supervised release, as I imposed them at the time of

sentencing in 2006, have three provisions that bear upon his request.

      The first states:

            The defendant shall not unlawfully possess a controlled
            substance. The defendant shall refrain from any unlawful
            use of a controlled substance.

Judgment, Supervised Release at 3 (Docket Item 243).               Under federal law,

marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance. 21 U.S.C. § 812(c)(10). The

second provision, appearing as number 7 under “Standard Conditions of

Supervision,” states:

            The defendant . . . shall not purchase, possess, use,
            distribute or administer any controlled substance . . .
            except as prescribed by a physician.

Id. The third provision, appearing as number 1, under “Additional Supervised

Release Terms,” states:

            Defendant shall     not   use   or   possess   any   controlled
            substance . . . .



                                                                                     2
Case 2:06-cr-00025-DBH Document 272 Filed 03/29/10 Page 3 of 6      PageID #: 1059



Id. at 4.   Friel focuses on the second, Standard Condition 7, containing the

language “except as prescribed by a physician,” and says that now he has such

a prescription and should be allowed to use. When I imposed that restriction

and the other conditions in 2006, however, neither federal law nor Maine law

permitted physicians to prescribe marijuana.      Federal law still prohibits the

medical use of marijuana with or without a prescription. Obviously, then, in

sentencing Friel, I did not envision his having the ability to use marijuana

while on supervised release.        Any apparent inconsistency among the three

provisions results solely from the recent change in Maine law.

      Setting aside for the moment any conflict between Maine law and federal

law, Friel is not an appropriate candidate for using marijuana while under

supervision, even if it is legal.    One Count of the underlying conviction was

possession with intent to distribute. In other words, Friel poses a substantial

risk of distributing marijuana, illegal under both federal and Maine law. What

is more, Friel has previously been convicted of drug dealing in this court. In

1998, I sentenced him to prison for possession with intent to distribute heroin.

See United States v. Friel, No. 2:97cr72 (Docket Item 75). Still another factor

that gives me concern about Friel’s willingness to conform his conduct to the

law is that I also sentenced him in 1992 to prison for two counts of being a

felon in possession of a firearm, yet he was convicted again of that crime in

2006. See United States v. Friel, No 2:92cr27.

      Thus, even if marijuana could now legally be used for medicinal

purposes, I would not permit Friel to use it in light of the drug trafficking risk

                                                                                 3
Case 2:06-cr-00025-DBH Document 272 Filed 03/29/10 Page 4 of 6                                  PageID #: 1060



he poses. It is not uncommon for people on supervised release to be restricted

from activities that are legal for the rest of the population. For example, Friel is

prohibited from using alcohol or any intoxicant; and he is prohibited from

possessing firearms, things that law-abiding citizens are entitled to do.

              Friel complains of back pain and says that marijuana is the most

effective way to address it. But he is also able to obtain a legal prescription for

Marinol and, as he testified, it does a better job of alleviating his pain than he

expected.

              I therefore find it unnecessary to address the tension between Maine law

and federal law in this case. I observe only the following. It is still illegal to

prescribe marijuana under federal law because federal law does not recognize

any medical use for a Schedule I controlled substance like marijuana.1 The

United States Supreme Court recently upheld the supremacy of federal law on

this subject in the context of California’s medical marijuana law. Gonzales v.

Raich, 545 U.S. 1,                                     29-30 (2005); see also Monson v. Drug Enforcement

Admin., 589 F.3d 952, 963-64 (8th Cir. 2009). I am aware that the United

States Attorney General has said that prosecutors have some discretion in

deciding whether to prosecute such cases in states that have medical

marijuana laws.                                Department of Justice Press Release, Attorney General

Announces                       Formal                Medical   Marijuana   Guidelines   (October   19,   2009)


                                                            
1 Because it is a Schedule I drug, the manufacture, distribution, or possession of marijuana is

a criminal offense. The single exception available is the use of the drug as part of a
government-approved research project. 21 U.S.C. §§ 823(f), 841(a)(1), 844(a); see also United
States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative, 532 U.S. 483, 490 (2001).

                                                                                                              4

(http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2009/October/09-ag-1119.html) (referencing

a copy of the guidelines in a memo from Deputy Attorney General David W.

Ogden                 to         Selected                      United   States   Attorneys   (October    19,   2009),

(http://blogs.usdoj.gov/blog/archives/192)). I am also aware that Maine has

not yet completed its regimen for distribution of medical marijuana.2 Whether

the United States Attorney General’s recognition of some prosecutorial

discretion should translate into any flexibility for people under federal

supervision by this court’s Probation Office can be addressed when Maine’s

medical marijuana regimen is complete and when a less risky supervisee

presents that issue.

              The best course for Friel at this time is to conform his behavior to the

Probation Office’s requirements and complete his term of supervised release

without incident. Friel managed without marijuana for the most part3 while he

was in prison.                            His two years of supervision will expire in October 2011;



                                                            
2 Friel complains that he attempted to comply with the Maine law by looking for a caregiver on

the Internet and that he found one (“in the woods”). But he refused to give the caregiver’s
name to the Probation Officer and reports that the caregiver does not have a registry
identification card. He says that the caregiver applied for one, but never received it, and he
relies on the Maine statutory provision that says that after 45 days the registry identification
card shall be deemed granted. 22 M.R.S.A. § 2429(2). But that provision also says that then
the application serves as a valid registry identification card and Friel admits that he never saw
the application. He excuses that omission because he says that the caregiver told him that the
State has his application (apparently he did not keep a copy). During all this, Friel also started
to grow his own marijuana, an alternate avenue under state law. 22 M.R.S.A. § 2423(1). But
then, he says, he uprooted his plants just short of maturity as a result of the Probation
Officer’s home visit. That visit also revealed a “roach,” demonstrating that Friel was already
using marijuana despite lack of permission from the Probation Officer. Friel recounts all this
as demonstrating his good faith attempt to comply with Maine law. But in light of what I have
said in text about my unwillingness to allow Friel to be a candidate for medical marijuana, it is
irrelevant.
3 His testimony suggested that he might have occasionally had access to marijuana in prison.

releasees who are fully compliant often secure early termination, a worthy goal

for Friel.
