               ORDER ON MOTION TO WITHDRAW PETITION


      The motion to withdraw the pending 28 U.S.C. § 2255 petition without

prejudice is GRANTED.     I express no view on what impact, if any, this

circumstance will have on any future claim the petitioner might make but,

through the government’s response, the petitioner has the benefit of the latter’s

view on the subject.

      SO ORDERED.

      DATED THIS 24TH DAY OF APRIL, 2017
