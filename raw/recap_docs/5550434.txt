STATEMENT OF REASONS

Vll COURT I)ETERMINATIONS OF REST|TUTION
A JZl R@sritutton Not Appiicable.
B '|`otal Arnount of Restitution:
C Restitution not ordered (Check only one.)'_

l l:] For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 13 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

2 [] For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under lB U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
issues ot` fact and relating them to the cause or amount ot`the victims' losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under lS U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(B).
3 l:| For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3663 andfor required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
ordered because the complication and prolongation ofthe sentencing process resulting from the fashioning ofa restitution order outweigh

the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(l)(B)(ii).

4 l:| Restitution is not ordered for other reasons (Explain.)

D l:l Partial restitution is ordered for these reasons (l 8 U.S.C. § 3553(0)):
