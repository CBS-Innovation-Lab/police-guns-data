             DECISION AND ORDER ON PETITIONER’S MOTION TO
                CORRECT SENTENCE UNDER 28 U.S.C. § 2255


       In 2012, Charles H. Casey, Jr. pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession

of a firearm. 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). At his sentencing, I determined that Casey

had been convicted of three qualifying prior crimes of violence and accordingly

sentenced him to 180 months under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18

U.S.C. § 924(e)(1).      Judgment at 1–2 (ECF. No. 65).              Without Armed Career

Criminal status, Casey’s maximum sentence would have been 10 years.                           18

U.S.C. § 924(a)(2).1

       Following the Supreme Court’s decision in Johnson v. United States, 135

S. Ct. 2551 (2015), holding the ACCA’s “residual” clause unconstitutional, Casey

filed a motion to correct his sentence under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Def.’s Mot. to

Correct Sentence (ECF No. 68). In response, the government argued that Casey

was procedurally barred from his Johnson claim and that his prior Maine


1I disagree with the government’s assertion that, even without Armed Career Criminal status,
Casey could have been sentenced to 180 months. Gov’t Resp. in Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. to Correct
Sentence at 6 (ECF No. 72). Casey pleaded guilty to and was sentenced on a single count of
being a felon in possession of a firearm, 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). That crime has a statutory cap of
120 months imprisonment, 18 U.S.C. § 924(a)(2), unless he was an Armed Career Criminal.

burglary convictions, see 17-A M.R.S.A. § 401, still qualify as predicates under

the ACCA’s “enumerated” clause. Gov’t Resp. in Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. to Correct

Sentence (ECF No. 72).

       Because extant First Circuit caselaw holds that Casey’s prior Maine

burglary convictions remain qualifying enumerated violent felonies even after

Johnson’s invalidation of the residual clause, he is unable to show actual

prejudice. I therefore DENY Casey’s motion to correct his sentence.

                                          ANALYSIS

(1)    Procedural Default

       The government argues that Casey is not entitled to relief because he is

procedurally barred from making his Johnson claim.                   It is well-settled that

“[c]ollateral relief in a § 2255 proceeding is generally unavailable if the petitioner

has procedurally defaulted his claim by fail[ing] to raise [the] claim in a timely

manner at trial or on [direct] appeal.” Bucci v. United States, 662 F.3d 18, 27

(1st Cir. 2011) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). At his

sentencing, Casey did not argue that the residual clause of the ACCA was

unconstitutionally void for vagueness, nor did he appeal his sentence. But I can

excuse Casey’s procedural default if he “show[s] both (1) ‘cause’ for having

procedurally defaulted his claim; and (2) ‘actual prejudice’ resulting from the

alleged error.” Bucci, 662 F.3d at 27 (quoting United States v. Frady, 456 U.S.

152, 167–68 (1982)).2


2 I can also excuse Casey’s procedural default if he shows “actual innocence.” Bousley v. United
States, 523 U.S. 614, 623 (1998). To establish “actual innocence,” Casey must show “factual
innocence, not mere legal insufficiency.” Id. Because Casey’s prior Maine burglary convictions
remain qualifying felonies under the ACCA, however, I reject his argument that he is actually

                                                                                              2

       (i)     Cause

       According to the Supreme Court, cause is satisfied “where a constitutional

claim is so novel that its legal basis is not reasonably available to counsel.” Reed

v. Ross, 468 U.S. 1, 16 (1984).3 The Court has identified three such instances

of novelty: (1) “a decision of this Court may explicitly overrule one of our

precedents”; (2) “a decision may overtur[n] a longstanding and widespread

practice to which this Court has not spoken, but which a near-unanimous body

of lower court authority has expressly approved”; and (3) “a decision may

disapprov[e] a practice this Court arguably has sanctioned in prior cases.” 468

U.S. at 17 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court

added that “[b]y definition, when a case falling into one of the first two categories

is given retroactive application, there will almost certainly have been no

reasonable basis upon which an attorney previously could have urged a state

court4 to adopt the position that this Court has ultimately adopted.” Id. In such

instances, the failure of the defendant’s attorney to raise the claim “is sufficiently

excusable to satisfy the cause requirement.” Id.




innocent of being an Armed Career Criminal, see Def.’s Reply on Issue of Procedural Default at
10–12 (ECF No. 76).
3 Although Reed concerned 28 U.S.C. § 2254, the First Circuit has ruled that “[t]here is no reason

to think that the definition of ‘cause’ will vary between” section 2254 and section 2255. Simpson
v. Matesanz, 175 F.3d 200, 211 (1st Cir. 1999).
4 The First Circuit uses the Reed standard for defendants sentenced in a federal district court as

well. See, e.g., Berthoff v. United States, 308 F.3d 124, 128 & n.3 (1st Cir. 2002) (determining
that a petitioner who was seeking relief under section 2255 had not shown cause because his
claim was not “novel” to a federal district court under the Reed standard); see also Davis v. United
States, 417 U.S. 333, 344 (1974) (“No microscopic reading of § 2255 can escape either the clear
and simple language of § 2254 authorizing habeas corpus relief ‘on the ground that (the prisoner)
is in custody in violation of the . . . laws . . . of the United States' or the unambiguous legislative
history showing that § 2255 was intended to mirror § 2254 in operative effect.” (alteration in
original)); Simpson, 175 F.3d at 210–12 (1st Cir. 1999).
                                                                                                     3
Case 2:11-cr-00216-DBH Document 77 Filed 11/03/16 Page 4 of 12                        PageID #: 178



       Casey argues that his case involves a straightforward application of Reed’s

first prong because in Johnson, 135 S. Ct. at 2563, the Supreme Court held that

the residual clause of the ACCA violated due process, overruling its prior

decisions in James v. United States, 550 U.S. 192 (2007), and Sykes v. United

States, 564 U.S. 1 (2011). The Court subsequently ruled in Welch v. United

States, 136 S. Ct. 1257, 1268 (2016), that Johnson announced a new

substantive rule that applied retroactively to cases on collateral review.

       The government contends, however, that Casey’s argument regarding the

unconstitutional vagueness of the residual clause was not “novel” at the time of

his sentencing. Gov’t Resp. in Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. to Correct Sentence at 4–5

(ECF No. 72). In support, the government cites the declaration in Bousley v.

United States that “futility cannot constitute cause if it means simply that a

claim was ‘unacceptable to that particular court at that particular time.’” 523

U.S. 614, 623 (1998) (quoting Engle v. Isaac, 456 U.S. 107, 130 n.35 (1982)).

But Bousley did not deal with a case where the Supreme Court overruled its own

precedents.5 Rather, the Court recognized that, in the absence of controlling

Supreme Court precedent “at the time of [Bousley]'s plea, the Federal Reporters

were replete with cases involving challenges to the notion that ‘use’ is



5 In Bousley, the petitioner pleaded guilty to “using” a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1).
Bousley, 523 U.S. at 616. Five years later, while his appeal was pending, the Supreme Court
decided in Bailey v. United States, 516 U.S. 137, 144 (1995), that section 924(c)(1)'s “use” prong
required the government to show “active employment of the firearm,” not “mere possession.”
Bousley consequently sought collateral relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, arguing that the legal basis
to attack his guilty plea was not “reasonably available” at the time of his plea. But Bailey did
not overrule precedent. See Bousley, 523 U.S. at 625 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and
dissenting in part) (“This case does not raise any question concerning the possible retroactive
application of a new rule of law, because our decision in Bailey v. United States did not change
the law.” (citations omitted)).

                                                                                                     4
Case 2:11-cr-00216-DBH Document 77 Filed 11/03/16 Page 5 of 12                      PageID #: 179



synonymous with mere ‘possession.’” Bousley, 523 U.S. at 622. Thus, even

though Bousley’s sentencing argument may have been “unacceptable to that

particular court at that particular time,” he could not establish cause for having

failed to raise it, as his argument did not match any of the three Reed criteria for

novelty.6 That is not this case.

       The government correctly points out that prior to Johnson, Justice Scalia

had on multiple occasions in dissent suggested that the Court hold the residual

clause void for vagueness. Derby v. United States, 131 S. Ct. 2858, 2859–60

(2011) (Scalia, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari); Sykes v. United States,

564 U.S. 1, 28 (2011) (Scalia, J., dissenting), overruled by Johnson, 135 S. Ct.

2551 (2015); James v. United States, 550 U.S. 192, 230–31 (2007) (Scalia, J.,

dissenting), overruled by Johnson, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015). The government

asserts that because Justice Scalia had explicitly raised the argument that the

residual clause was unconstitutionally vague, the argument was not “novel.”

       This argument, however, overlooks the distinction between Reed and

Bousley. In Reed, the Supreme Court plainly stated that a claim is “novel” when

the Court “explicitly overrule[s] one of our precedents.”                  468 U.S. at 17.        In

Bousley, on the other hand, the Supreme Court ruled that a claim is not “novel”


6 Bousley controlled the First Circuit’s ruling in Brache v. United States, 165 F.3d 99 (1st Cir.
1999). In Brache, the petitioner did not object to an overbroad jury instruction regarding the
“use” of a firearm under section 924(c)(1) before the Supreme Court adopted a narrower definition
in Bailey. Similar to Bousley, Brache argued that he had shown cause because there was “no
reasonable basis in existing law” to challenge the broad definition of “use” in the jury instruction.
Brache, 165 F.3d at 102 (internal quotation marks omitted). The First Circuit noted that “the
instruction was at the time correct under First Circuit precedent,” and therefore could not have
been challenged successfully. Nevertheless, the court concluded that Bousley foreclosed a
showing of cause for Brache’s failure to challenge the instruction, quoting the Bousley language
that “the Federal Reporters were replete with cases involving challenges to the notion that ‘use’
is synonymous with mere ‘possession’ at the time of the . . . plea.” Brache, 165 F.3d at 102.

                                                                                                   5
Case 2:11-cr-00216-DBH Document 77 Filed 11/03/16 Page 6 of 12                     PageID #: 180



when it has been raised in the lower courts but not yet decided by the Supreme

Court.7 To be sure, in the wake of Bousley, “the First Circuit has made it clear

that the fact that there are First Circuit precedents that hold against the movant's

argument does not suffice to establish futility.” United States v. Dean, 231 F.

Supp. 2d 382, 386 (D. Me. 2002) (emphasis added).8 Yet the government does

not and cannot point to any authority suggesting that Reed does not apply when

the Supreme Court expressly overrules its own prior precedent. See Simpson v.

Matesanz, 175 F.3d 200, 211–12 (1st Cir. 1999). Nor has the Court given any

indication that Reed no longer remains good law. See Bousley, 523 U.S. at 622;

cf. Hohn v. United States, 524 U.S. 236, 252–53 (1998) (“Our decisions remain

binding precedent until we see fit to reconsider them, regardless of whether

subsequent cases have raised doubts about their continuing vitality.”).                            I

conclude that under Reed, Casey’s Johnson claim is a novel constitutional claim

that applies retroactively, and he has therefore shown cause for his default.

       (ii)    Prejudice

       To show prejudice, the petitioner must demonstrate “a reasonable

probability” that but for the alleged error, “the result of the proceeding would

have been different.” Prou v. United States, 199 F.3d 37, 48–49 (1st Cir. 1999)

(internal quotation marks omitted). That in turn depends on whether Casey’s



7 As the Supreme Court reiterated most recently, “[I]t is this Court’s prerogative alone to overrule
one of its precedents.” Bosse v. Oklahoma, 192 L. Ed. 2d 1, 3 (Oct. 11, 2016) (per curiam)
(alteration in original) (quoting United States v. Hatter, 532 U.S. 557, 567 (2001)).
8 The First Circuit has declared that “Bousley made it clear that if an issue has been decided

adversely to an argument in the relevant jurisdiction, and the argument is not made for that
reason, that is insufficient reason to constitute cause for a procedural default.” Simpson v.
Matesanz, 175 F.3d 200, 211 (1st Cir. 1999). Nonetheless, the First Circuit continues to treat
Reed as good law. Simpson, 175 F.3d at 212, 215.

                                                                                                  6

prior Maine burglary convictions still constitute predicate offenses under the

ACCA’s enumerated clause. Although Casey has a strong argument that they

do not, the current state of First Circuit caselaw is against him as I describe

below, and he will have to make his argument challenging that caselaw in an

appeal to the First Circuit. At this stage, he has not shown prejudice.9

(2)    Maine Burglary Convictions

       For Casey, the validity of his Armed Career Criminal sentence depends on

whether at the time of sentencing he had three previous convictions for a violent

felony or a serious drug offense. See 18 U.S. C. § 924(e)(1). According to the

revised presentence report, Casey had five prior Maine convictions that qualified,

four of them involving burglary.10            The question then is whether the Maine

burglary convictions fit the portion of the ACCA that refers to a felony that is

“burglary . . . or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk

of physical injury to another.” Id. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The government does not

contend that, after Johnson, Casey’s prior Maine burglary convictions, see 17-A




9 I do not accept the government’s argument based on United States v. Ruiz-Garcia, 886 F.2d
474, 476 (1st Cir. 1989). In citing that case, the government contends that Casey cannot show
prejudice because he agreed in his plea agreement that the ACCA applied to him and failed to
argue that the ACCA did not apply in the presentence report or on direct appeal. Gov’t Resp. in
Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. to Correct Sentence at 6 (ECF No. 72). Casey’s plea agreement, however,
expressly stated that his “waiver of his right to appeal shall not apply to appeals based on a right
that has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases
on collateral review.” Agreement to Plead Guilty at 2–3 (ECF No. 52). Moreover, Ruiz-Garcia
involved a direct appeal where the appellant had not shown “any supportable basis in law or
fact” to alter his sentence, 886 F.2d at 477, rather than a collateral challenge involving “a
constitutional principle that had not been previously recognized but which is held to have
retroactive application,” Reed v. Ross, 468 U.S. 1, 17 (1984). As I have determined above, Casey’s
Johnson claim is a novel constitutional claim with retroactive application to cases on collateral
review.
10 The revised presentence report lists five qualifying convictions.       See Revised Presentence
Report ¶ 17. They are three burglaries, an attempted burglary, and a drug conspiracy. Id. at
¶¶ 26, 29, 30, 32, 33. The government concedes that the drug offense does not qualify. Gov’t
Resp. in Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. to Correct Sentence at 2 n.1 (ECF No. 72).
                                                                                                  7
Case 2:11-cr-00216-DBH Document 77 Filed 11/03/16 Page 8 of 12                  PageID #: 182



M.R.S.A. § 401, qualify under the so-called residual clause (“otherwise involves

conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another”).

Instead, it argues that binding First Circuit precedent, United States v. Duquette,

778 F.3d 314, 317–18 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 262 (2015), has

determined that Maine’s burglary statute qualifies as “generic” burglary and that

Casey’s prior convictions are therefore “enumerated” convictions for purpose of

the ACCA. Gov’t Resp. in Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. to Correct Sentence at 7–9 (ECF

No. 72).

       For his part, Casey relies upon the Supreme Court’s post-Duquette

decision in Mathis v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2243, 2250, 2257 (June 23, 2016),

to argue that convictions under Maine’s burglary statute no longer qualify.11

       In Duquette, the First Circuit examined whether Maine’s burglary statute

contained the elements of generic burglary identified by the Supreme Court in

Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575 (1990). Duquette, 778 F.3d at 317–18.

The First Circuit determined that Maine’s burglary statute did indeed “set[ ] forth

the ‘generic burglary’ elements of (1) unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or

remaining in, (2) a building or structure, with (3) intent to commit a crime.” Id.12



11 Unlike its argument about Johnson, the government has not argued that the Mathis analysis
should not be applied to Casey’s sentence. Instead, it argues that Mathis does not alter the
Duquette analysis.
12 Under Maine’s burglary statute, an individual is guilty of burglary when she “enters or

surreptitiously remains in a structure knowing that that person is not licenced or privileged to
do so, with the intent to commit a crime therein.” 17–A M.R.S.A. § 401(1). The statute provides
that “structure” means “a building or other place designed to provide protection for persons or
property against weather or intrusion, but does not include vehicles and other conveyances
whose primary purpose is transportation of persons or property unless such vehicle or
conveyance, or a section thereof, is also a dwelling place.” 17-A M.R.S.A. § 2(24) (emphasis
added). In turn, a “dwelling place” means “a structure that is adapted for overnight
accommodation of persons, or sections of any structure similarly adapted.” 17-A M.R.S.A.
§ 2(10).

                                                                                              8

Consequently, the First Circuit concluded that a Maine burglary conviction

qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA. Id. at 318.

       The next year in Mathis, the Supreme Court ruled that Iowa’s burglary

statute, Iowa Code § 702.12, covered more conduct than generic burglary and

did not qualify as a predicate violent felony under the ACCA.13 Acknowledging

the wide range of land, water, and air vehicles specified in Iowa’s burglary

statute, the Supreme Court determined that the Iowa statute “defines one crime,

with one set of elements, broader than generic burglary—while specifying

multiple means of fulfilling its locational element, some but not all of which (i.e.,

buildings and other structures, but not vehicles) satisfy the generic definition.”

Mathis, 136 S. Ct. at 2250. Because Iowa’s burglary statute had a broader

locational element than generic burglary, the Court held that the Mathis’s prior

burglary convictions could not support an ACCA sentence. Id. at 2257.

       In the First Circuit, the “law of the circuit” doctrine makes a prior First

Circuit decision “inviolate absent either the occurrence of a controlling

intervening event (e.g., a Supreme Court opinion on the point; a ruling of the

circuit, sitting en banc; or a statutory overruling) or, in extremely rare

circumstances, where non-controlling but persuasive case law suggests such a

course.” United States v. Chhien, 266 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 2001). Thus, the

question here is whether the Supreme Court’s decision in Mathis constitutes “a

controlling intervening event” such that district courts in the First Circuit should


13 Iowa’s burglary statute defined an “occupied structure” as “any building, structure,
appurtenances to buildings and structures, land, water or air vehicle, or similar place adapted
for overnight accommodation of persons, or occupied by persons for the purpose of carrying on
business or other activity therein, or for the storage or safekeeping of anything of value.” Iowa
Code § 702.12.

no longer follow Duquette’s directive that Maine burglary qualifies as a violent

felony under the ACCA. Chhien, 266 F.3d at 11.

       In dictum,14 another judge in this District has determined that even after

Mathis, Duquette remains “the ‘law of the circuit’ and that this Court is bound

by it unless and until the First Circuit decides to revisit Duquette.” Dimott v.

United States, No. 2:06-cr-6-GZS, 2016 WL 6068114, at *3–4 (D. Me. Oct. 14,

2016), appeal docketed, No. 16-2289 (1st Cir. Oct. 25, 2016). The Dimott court

noted that, in light of Mathis, Maine’s burglary statute could be read as

“categorically reaching a broader range of places than generic burglary,” but

nonetheless concluded that “Duquette currently provides a binding answer to

that question within the First Circuit.” Dimott, 2016 WL 6068114, at *4. I follow

Dimott and apply Duquette. Maine’s burglary statute encompasses a narrower

ranger of places than the Iowa statute in Mathis, which covered “any building,

structure, [or] land, water, or air vehicle,” Iowa Code § 702.12. By contrast,

Maine burglary includes only “a building or other place designed to provide

protection for persons or property against weather or intrusion” and certain

“vehicles and other conveyances,” 17-A M.R.S.A. § 2(24), that are “adapted for

overnight accommodation of persons,” 17-A M.R.S.A. § 2(10).                      Given the

appreciable difference in locations covered by the Maine and Iowa burglary

statutes, I do not consider Mathis ipso facto a definitive ruling that Duquette is

wrong.


14I say dictum because the Dimott court first decided that the petition there was untimely. In
doing so, the court ruled that Mathis did not announce a new substantive rule that was
retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. Dimott, 2016 WL 6068114, at *3. The
government has made no such argument here.

                                                                                           10

       I believe that Mathis has, however, cast significant doubt on the continued

vitality of Duquette.15 In the wake of Mathis, Maine’s burglary statute, which

encompasses camping vehicles, trailers, sleeper trains, and airplanes and boats

with sleeping accommodations, seems to have a broader locational element than

generic burglary.16 But I leave that conclusion to the First Circuit.




15 Dimott observed that, although Duquette preceded both Johnson and Mathis, the Supreme
Court denied certiorari in Duquette, 778 F.3d 314 (1st Cir. 2015), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 262
(Oct. 5, 2015), a few months before deciding to review the Eighth Circuit's ruling in Mathis, 786
F.3d 1068 (8th Cir. 2015), cert. granted, 136 S. Ct. 894 (Jan. 19, 2016). Dimott, 2016 WL
6068114, at *4. “Given this timeline,” the court determined that Mathis did not overrule
Duquette. Dimott, 2016 WL 6068114, at *4. The Supreme Court itself, however, has “frequently
said that the denial of certiorari imports no expression of opinion upon the merits of a case.”
Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 456 (1953) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, I respectfully
disagree that either this court or the First Circuit should infer from the Supreme Court’s denial
of certiorari in Duquette, 136 S. Ct. 262, that Duquette survives Mathis.
16 In addition to arguing Duquette, the government has cited Lussier v. United States, No. 15-

2500 (1st Cir. June 20, 2016), as a post-Mathis First Circuit decision that Duquette still governs.
Gov’t Resp. in Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. to Correct Sentence at 8 (ECF No. 72). Lussier, however, was
decided before Mathis (June 20, 2016 vs. June 23, 2016). The government also cited United
States v. Herrold, 813 F.3d 595 (5th Cir. Feb. 12, 2016), cert. granted, judgment vacated, 2016
WL 4367616 (Oct. 11, 2016). Gov’t Resp. in Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. to Correct Sentence at 9–10
(ECF No. 72). That, too, was a pre-Mathis decision. In fact, in the wake of the Supreme Court’s
Mathis decision, other federal circuit courts have consistently applied Mathis to find state
burglary statutes insufficient as qualifying enumerated felonies. E.g., United States v. Ritchey,
No. 15-2460, 2016 WL 6247122, at *8 (6th Cir. Oct. 26, 2016) (concluding that Michigan’s
breaking and entering statute was broader than generic burglary and could therefore not serve
as a predicate offense under the ACCA); United States v. White, No. 15-4096, 2016 WL 4717943,
at *7-8 (4th Cir. Sept. 9, 2016) (determining that “the West Virginia’s burglary statute's reference
to a dwelling house ‘easily could cover’ enclosures that are excluded from the generic definition
of burglary, such as vehicles” and consequently did not constitute a violent felony under the
ACCA (citation omitted)); United States v. Smith, No. 15-3033, 2016 WL 4626561, at *1 (7th Cir.
Sept. 6, 2016) (“In light of Mathis, the government now concedes that it is unable to demonstrate
that Smith's conviction for second-degree Missouri Burglary qualifies as a predicate felony under
the Act.”); United States v. Door, No. 14-30170, 2016 WL 4207977, at *1 (9th Cir. Aug. 10, 2016)
(holding that, “in light of Mathis, Door's prior convictions for burglary in Washington are not
violent felonies”); United States v. Pledge, No. 15-2245, 2016 WL 3644648, at *1 (8th Cir. July 8,
2016) (per curiam) (ruling that, following Mathis, the defendant could not be classified as an
armed career criminal due to his prior conviction under Iowa’s burglary statute).
