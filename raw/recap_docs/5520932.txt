              MOTION FOR APPROVAL OF EXPENDITURE OF FUNDS
               FOR TRANSCRIPT OF STATE COURT PROCEEDING

         Now comes the Defendant in the above captioned matter by and through his

attorney and requests this Honorable Court to approve the expenditure of funds for a

transcript of the state suppression hearing.

         In support hereof, the Defendant submits the following:

         This indictment charges the Defendant with 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g)(1); Possession of a

Firearm and Ammunition by a Felon. It is anticipated that, if convicted the government will be

seeking a substantial term of imprisonment (in excess of 15 years) for the Defendant under the

guidelines and the applicable mandatory sentencing provisions.       Since the Defendant is

approximately 24 years old, if convicted he will most likely spend a substantial part of his

adulthood in prison. He has entered a plea of not guilty and intends to put the government to

its proof.

         The evidence against the Defendant consists in part of the testimony of a police

officer who stopped the vehicle in which the Defendant was a passenger.

         There has already been a suppression hearing in state court in connection with this

matter. That hearing was recorded on four-track tape by the state Court. In that hearing the

police officer referenced above along with other witnesses provided conflicting testimony with

regard to the initial stop of the vehicle. In its Memorandum in Support of it's Motion To

Suppress the Defendant makes several references to the state suppression hearing testimony. A

transcript of the state suppression hearing would assist the Court and the parties in

determining the exact testimony of the witnesses.

         The Defendant would request that an expenditure of amount not to exceed $1,000 be

authorized for the employment of a stenographer to transcribe the state suppression hearing

tapes.
