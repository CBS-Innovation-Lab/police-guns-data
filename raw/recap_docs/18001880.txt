         WRITS ACT, 28 U.S.C. § 1651, DENYING MOTION TO EXPUNGE
         CONVICTION, AND GRANTING PRO SE MOTION TO REDUCE
                                  SENTENCE

         On August 20, 2014, William Leland moved for reconsideration of his pro se

 motion for writ of audita querela, which asked the Court to recalculate his sentencing

 guideline range to eliminate a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, to

 grant a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, and to allow a further

 two-level reduction pursuant to Amendment 782 of the United States Sentencing

 Guidelines. Mr. Leland separately asks the Court to expunge his conviction for

 possession of a firearm by a felon. Finally, he later filed a separate pro se motion to

 reduce sentence. The Court denies the motion for reconsideration of its order denying

 the motion for writ of audita querela, denies the motion to expunge his firearms

 conviction, denies the motion based on ineffective counsel, but grants the motion for

 reduction of sentence under Guidelines Amendment 782 and reduces his sentence

 from 252 months to 201 months.

       A.    Motion and Order

       Sentenced on October 28, 2005 to 252 months of incarceration for seven federal

 felonies, representing his leadership role in a major drug trafficking conspiracy

 involving cocaine, methamphetamine, oxycodone, marijuana, and MDMA (Ecstasy)

 and possession of a firearm by a felon, William Leland has waged a determined and

 relentless campaign to obtain a court order reducing his sentence. The primary

 source of Mr. Leland’s discontent is that the sentence was more severe than the one

 he thought he was going to receive under the terms of the plea agreement with the

 Government.

             1.     The Plea Agreement

       The plea agreement provided in part:

             3. Pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(B) the parties agree to
       take the following positions at sentencing:

             A. The parties agree to recommend that the Court find that the
       Base Offense Level pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1 is 32 and that the
       amount of the narcotics and other illegal substances involved in all
       reasonably foreseeable acts or omissions of the defendant and other co-
       conspirators totals between 1,500 and 3,000 kilograms of marijuana on
       the drug equivalency table.

             B. The parties agree to recommend that the evidence does not
       support a finding that any dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was
       possessed in relation to any of the drug offenses.

              C. The parties agree to recommend that the Court find that the
       offense level should be increased by four (4) points under U.S.S.G. §
       3B1.1(a) because the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal
       activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise
       extensive.

             D. The Government agrees to recommend that the Court find
       that the Defendant has accepted responsibility for the offenses of

                                          2
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 3 of 76            PageID #: 1454



       conviction in the above-captioned Indictment, and that the Court should
       reduce by 3 levels Defendant’s Adjusted Offense Level under U.S.S.G. §
       3E1.1.

              The Government reserves the right not to recommend a reduction
       under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1 if, at any time between his/her execution of this
       Agreement and sentencing Defendant (a) fails to admit a complete
       factual basis for the plea; (b) fails to truthfully admit his/her conduct in
       the offenses of conviction; and (c) falsely denies or frivolously contests
       relevant conduct for which Defendant is accountable under U.S.S.G. §
       1B1.3. Defendant understands that he/she may not withdraw his/her
       guilty plea if, for any of the reasons listed above, the Government does
       not recommend that he/she receive a reduction in Offense Level for
       acceptance of responsibility.

       4. The Government and the Defendant agree to recommend that the
       Court impose a period of imprisonment within the applicable guideline
       range, in addition to restitution and supervised release to be determined
       by the Court at the time of sentencing. The parties agree not to seek
       any further additions or reductions to the guidelines, other than those
       set forth in section Three. The parties agree not to seek nor recommend
       any upward or downward departures. The parties expressly agree and
       understand that these recommendations will not be binding on the
       Court and should the Court reject the recommendations of the parties,
       Defendant will not thereby be permitted to withdraw his/her guilty plea.
       The parties agree and understand that the Court has the discretion to
       impose any lawful sentence.

 Agreement to Plead Guilty at 4-5 (ECF No. 207) (Plea Agreement).             Finally, in

 paragraph 6, Mr. Leland agreed not to “appeal or collaterally attack any matter

 pertaining to this prosecution and sentence as long as the sentence of imprisonment

 is less than 210 months.” Id. at 5.

              2.    The Rule 11 Hearing

       On January 27, 2004, the Court engaged Mr. Leland in an extensive Rule 11

 colloquy. Tr. of Proceedings at 1-29 (ECF No. 306). The Court specifically advised

 Mr. Leland that the statutory maximum for two of the counts was life imprisonment.



                                            3
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 4 of 76          PageID #: 1455



 Id. at 7:15-23. The Court warned Mr. Leland that depending on the drug quantity,

 there were statutory minimum sentences of either ten or five years. Id. at 8:21-9:8.

 The Court reviewed detailed contents of the plea agreement with Mr. Leland. First,

 the Court established that Mr. Leland was pleading guilty to the charged crimes

 because he was actually guilty and that he was truthfully admitting to the facts

 underlying the offenses:

       THE COURT: Now, Mr. Leland, have you pled guilty to Counts 1, 2, 3,
       6, 8, 10, and 14 of the second superseding indictment of this case because
       you are actually guilty?

       THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

 Tr. of Proceedings at 5:16-19 (ECF No. 306) (Rule 11 Hr’g).

 …………..

       THE COURT: Now, as a part of your pleading guilty, I must find there’s
       a factual basis for your guilty plea, and to assure myself there is such a
       factual basis, I will be asking you questions about the conduct that gave
       rise to these charges, and you must answer my questions truthfully. Do
       you understand?

       THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.

 Id. at 16:8-14. Later, the Court returned to the prosecution version of the offenses

 and asked Mr. Leland direct questions about the underlying facts:

       THE COURT: Now, Mr. Leland, have you had an opportunity to review
       [the] government’s version of the offense dated January 27, 2004?

       THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.

       THE COURT: I’m going to ask a very important question, Mr. Leland,
       and I want your honest answer. Is there any respect with which you
       disagree with what is set forth in government’s version of the offense
       dated January 27, 2004?



                                           4
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 5 of 76           PageID #: 1456



       THE DEFENDANT: No, sir.

       THE COURT: Is the information contained in the government’s version
       of the offense dated January 27, 2004, true to your own personal
       knowledge?

       THE DEFENDANT: Yes, it is.

 Id. 18:5-18. Before turning to the Plea Agreement, the Court directly asked Mr.

 Leland whether anyone had threatened him or attempted to force him in any way to

 plead guilty:

       THE COURT: Now, the next part of this process, Mr. Leland, is for me
       to assure myself that you’re pleading guilty today voluntarily, of your
       own free will. So I am going to ask you a number of questions directed
       to that issue. Has anyone threatened you or has anyone attempted to
       force you to get you in any way to plead guilty?

       THE DEFENDANT: No.

 Id. 18:24-19:5.

       The Court also questioned Mr. Leland closely about his understanding of the

 Plea Agreement’s sentencing provisions:

       THE COURT:           This contains a number of references to
       recommendations that the parties agree to make to the court concerning
       base offense levels and whether the evidence supports a finding of a
       dangerous weapon possessed in relation to the drug offense, increases
       in points, acceptance of responsibility, and other matters. Did you
       review that paragraph before coming into court today?

       THE DEFENDANT: Yes, I did.

       THE COURT: What I want you to understand, Mr. Leland, is this. That
       as far as sentencing is concerned, this plea agreement permits you and
       your lawyer, Mr. Largay, and the prosecutor to make recommendations
       to the court regarding sentencing, but the authority to determine the
       appropriate sentence in this case rests with me as the judge in this court.
       Do you understand that, sir?



                                           5
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 6 of 76         PageID #: 1457



       THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.

       THE COURT: If I do not accept the recommendations, even those
       recommendations that are set forth in paragraph 3, you will have no
       right to withdraw your guilty plea. Do you understand?

       THE DEFENDANT: Yes, I do.

 Id. at 22:24-23:19.

       The Court addressed with Mr. Leland the potential impact of the Sentencing

 Guidelines:

       THE COURT: I can’t determine the guideline sentence until I’ve read a
       presentence report the probation office will prepare and until I’ve given
       your lawyer and the prosecutor an opportunity to challenge the facts in
       the probation office report. After I determine what guideline does apply
       to the case, I still have the authority in some circumstances to impose a
       sentence that is more severe or it could be less severe than the sentence
       called for by the applicable guideline. Do you understand?

       THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.

       THE COURT: What I want you to understand, Mr. Leland, [is] that
       even if I impose a sentence that is more severe than the one called for
       by the applicable guideline, you will still not be permitted to withdraw
       your guilty plea. Do you understand?

       THE DEFENDANT: Yes, I do.

 Id. 23:25-24:15.

       Finally, the Court directly asked Mr. Leland whether there were any side deals

 not set forth in the Plea Agreement:

       THE COURT: Now, aside from this written plea agreement, has anyone
       made any promises to you in an effort to get you to plead guilty?

       THE DEFENDANT: No, sir.

       THE COURT: Has anyone made any promises to you as to what kind of
       sentence I will ultimately impose?

                                          6
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 7 of 76          PageID #: 1458




       THE DEFENDANT: No, sir.

       THE COURT: Has anyone made any promises to you, other than what
       is contained in paragraph 3 of the agreement to plead guilty? Has
       anyone made any promises to you, other than what is set forth there - -

       THE DEFENDANT: No.

       THE COURT: - - as to what the prosecutor’s recommendation will be?

       THE DEFENDANT: No.

 Id. 25:3-17.

                3.   The Presentence Report

       On May 4, 2004, the Probation Office (PO) issued its first version of the

 Presentence Report (PSR) in this case and it revised the PSR on May 26, 2004 and

 October 19, 2005. PSR at 2. The PSR contained some disturbing news. Regarding

 the PO’s comments on obstruction of justice, paragraph 60 of the PSR read:

       In March 2004, following his guilty plea, defendant Leland wrote a letter
       to members of the Hell’s Angels noting his desire to cause bodily injury
       to codefendant Robert Stewart, as Stewart provided incriminating
       information to authorities regarding Leland. Therefore, the defendant,
       directly or indirectly, attempted to threaten, intimidate or otherwise
       unlawfully influence a codefendant or witness. Further, in March 2004,
       defendant Leland disseminated discovery material to others, including
       prison inmates, known felons in the community and other Hell’s Angels.

 Id. at 17. The PO recommended that the Court impose a two-level enhancement for

 obstruction of justice and deny the three-level reduction for acceptance of

 responsibility. Id. at 18. The PO calculated Mr. Leland’s offense level as follows: (1)

 it began with a base offense level of 32 based on drug quantity, (2) it applied a two-

 level dangerous weapons enhancement, (3) it applied a four-level organizer or leader



                                           7
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 8 of 76           PageID #: 1459



 enhancement (4) it recommended a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice,

 and (5) it denied acceptance of responsibility. The result was a total offense level of

 40.   Id. at 17-18.   The PO calculated Mr. Leland’s criminal history category at

 Category II. Id. at 20. It arrived at a Guideline sentence range of imprisonment of

 between 324 and 405 months. Id. at 23.

              4.       The Motion to Withdraw the Guilty Plea

        On January 19, 2005, Mr. Leland moved to withdraw his guilty plea. Mot. to

 Withdraw Guilty Plea (ECF No. 279). In his motion, he argued that (1) he had

 discovered that his wife was involved in an affair with one of the Government’s

 confidential informants and that together they had plotted to put him in prison, (2)

 his wife had the opportunity and apparent desire to place methamphetamine in the

 vehicle in which he was traveling, (3) that there were repeated weight changes, color

 changes, and packing differences in the alleged methamphetamine found in the spare

 tire of the vehicle in which the Defendant was traveling, (4) that the Government

 improperly seized the Defendant’s camera and film, (5) that the then-recent issuance

 of the United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005) required that the Defendant be

 allowed to withdraw his guilty plea, (6) that the Government failed to provide the

 Defendant with all pertinent discovery, and (7) that Pamela Paradis, a co-conspirator,

 admitted she perjured herself when she testified at Mr. Leland’s detention hearing.

 Id. at 1-2. In the motion, Mr. Leland’s counsel wrote that “there are many issues with

 the discovery that the Defendant believes support his claim of innocence.” Id. at 3.

              5.       The Hearing on the Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea



                                           8
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 9 of 76          PageID #: 1460



       On March 10, 2005, the Court held an oral argument on the motion to

 withdraw the guilty plea at which Mr. Leland was present. Tr. of Proceedings (ECF

 No. 290). During that hearing, his counsel confirmed that Mr. Leland was “without

 knowledge that the methamphetamine was in the tire in the trunk of his car.” Id.

 Attach. 1 at 32:25-33:3. He also asserted that he was in fact innocent of any of the

 crimes to which he pleaded guilty, including the firearm possession charge. Id. at

 30:24-31:1 (“I conferred with him a moment ago, Your Honor.            He maintains

 innocence with respect to more than just that one crime”); 33:25-34:2 (THE COURT:

 “So he didn’t possess the firearm? MR. LARGAY: That’s what he maintains”).

              6.    The Order on the Motion to Withdraw Guilty Pleas

       On April 7, 2005, the Court denied Mr. Leland’s motion to withdraw his guilty

 pleas. Order on Def.’s Mot. to Withdraw Guilty Plea (ECF No. 291).

              7.    The Presentence Conference

       At the final Presentence Conference on October 24, 2005, the Court raised the

 question of the Probation Officer’s recommendation to impose an obstruction of

 justice enhancement. Tr. of Proceedings at 5:25-8 (ECF No. 341) (Presentence Conf.

 Tr.). The Court confirmed that Mr. Leland objected to the obstruction of justice

 enhancement on two grounds: “First, that the letter about Mr. Stewart is not as some

 would interpret it to be; and, secondly, that he didn’t disseminate discovery, rather,

 the discovery was stolen from his cell.” Id. at 6:11-14. The Government took the

 position that under the terms of the plea agreement, it could not argue for an




                                           9
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 10 of 76           PageID #: 1461



 obstruction enhancement. Id. at 6:15-20. The Court also discussed acceptance of

 responsibility. Id. at 9:4-20.

              8.     The Sentencing Hearing

       The Court sentenced Mr. Leland on October 27, 2005. Tr. of Sentencing Hr’g

 (ECF No. 339) (Sentencing Hr’g). During the sentencing hearing, the Court adopted

 much of what the parties had agreed to in the Plea Agreement in calculating the

 Guideline sentence range. The Court began with the base offense level of 32, Plea

 Agreement ¶ 3(A); it added a four-level enhancement for leadership role, id. ¶ 3(C);

 and, although the issue was a close one, the Court accepted the parties’ argument

 that the firearms enhancement would not apply. Id. ¶ 3(B).

                     a.     The Obstruction Enhancement

       This left two issues: whether Mr. Leland had attempted to obstruct justice and

 whether he should be accorded acceptance of responsibility. The obstruction of justice

 issue first related to a letter in Mr. Leland’s distinctive handwriting to a man named

 “David” discussing Robert Stewart, a codefendant and witness against Mr. Leland.

 Sentencing Hr’g at 62-63. Referring to Mr. Stewart, Mr. Leland’s letter stated in part:

       Sending some paperwork that you and others in your area will be
       interested in . . . That bastard has been a rat since 2000. He told a lot
       of lies about me.

 Id. at 62. Mr. Leland’s letter then referred to a man named Alan McDougal and said:

       Both of them have been rats for a long time . . . The club didn’t support
       me through this because of them, and now the club knows the difference.
       I hope they come around. Well, David, I always like you a lot and wanted
       you to know what he was. I pray I meet him in here someday. He thinks
       he’s tough. I’ll show the asshole what tough is. You take care of yourself.



                                           10
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 11 of 76         PageID #: 1462



 Id. Mr. Leland signed the letter “Your real friend, Bill Leland, Hells Angels.” Id. at

 62-63. Mr. Leland attached seven pages of investigative reports that detailed Mr.

 Stewart’s involvement in the greater conspiracy.      Id. at 63.   At the end of the

 investigative report, Mr. Leland wrote:

       Look at that. The asshole gave up his in-laws. What a nice guy.

 Id.

       A second matter was a letter dated April 26, 2004 that Mr. Leland wrote his

 son, Derek Leland, thanking him for “photocopying all that stuff on Omar and Donny

 Grace.” Id. Mr. Leland says that the information “is going to help me a lot.” Id. He

 asked his son to mark the information “Legal correspondence” in the lower right-hand

 corner and mail it to Walter Cobb at the same address as his, namely the Maine State

 Prison. Id. The Government produced evidence that Mr. Leland’s request to his son

 violated the prison’s mail policy. Id. Omar and Don Grace were both prosecuted,

 convicted and sentenced as members of Mr. Leland’s drug trafficking conspiracy. See

 United States v. Don Grace, Docket No. 1:07-cr-00007-JAW, Docket No. 1:02-cr-

 00017-JAW; United States v. Omar Grace, Docket No. 1:02-cr-00017-JAW.

       A third matter was the fact that when law enforcement executed a search

 warrant at the Old County Road, Hampden, Maine residence of a man named Thomas

 Dunroe, a known and convicted drug dealer, they came upon an extensive Drug

 Enforcement Agency (DEA) investigative report, detailing the status of a number of

 DEA investigations in the Bangor, Maine area. Sentencing Hr’g at 63-64. A cover

 letter in the report was from Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) Daniel Perry



                                           11
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 12 of 76           PageID #: 1463



 to Attorney Christopher Largay, who was Mr. Leland’s defense counsel, and the cover

 letter referenced the criminal docket number of this case. Id. at 64.

       Regarding Mr. Leland’s letter about Robert Stewart, the Court found that “it

 constitutes a threat against Mr. Stewart” and observed that “I can’t understand any

 other purpose in the letter other than to alert other individuals who may know Mr.

 Stewart that he was acting as a witness against Mr. Leland and to have them take

 the kinds of action that Mr. Leland promises to take.” Id. at 64-65. The Court noted

 that the threat against Mr. Stewart was serious enough in itself, but that Mr. Leland

 later filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea and if that motion had been successful,

 Mr. Stewart “would have been front and center during the course of that trial.” Id.

 at 65. The Court found the information that Mr. Leland had received from his son

 and had urged his son to send to Walter Cobb to involve Omar and Don Grace, “both

 of whom are mentioned as being connected with Mr. Leland in the drug distribution

 crime to which he has pleaded guilty.” Id. at 65. Finally, the Court said that “whoever

 sent [the DEA] information to Mr. Dunroe had the intent to obstruct or interfere with

 an ongoing governmental investigation.” Id. It offered two possibilities: Mr. Leland

 or Attorney Largay. Id. at 65. Although Mr. Napolitano offered a third possibility,

 namely another inmate, the Court noted that there was “no evidence other than what

 I have before me” and the “only inference I can draw is that it was sent to Mr. Leland

 and then found its way one way or the other from Mr. Leland’s cell to the Old County

 Road.” Id. at 66-67.




                                           12
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 13 of 76          PageID #: 1464



       Based on all of this information, the Court applied the two-level obstruction of

 justice enhancement under USSG § 3C1.1. Id. at 67-68. The Court concluded that

 Mr. Leland’s letter to “David” was a threat against a material witness, that his letter

 to Derek Leland was a violation of prison regulations and involved co-conspirators,

 and that Mr. Leland was involved in the dissemination of information he had received

 from his attorney that obstructed or attempted to obstruct an ongoing federal

 investigation of Bangor area drug dealing. Id. at 67-68.

                     b.    Acceptance of Responsibility

       Unlike the obstruction of justice enhancement, where the Government did not

 seek the enhancement pursuant to the terms of its Plea Agreement, the Government

 actively argued that Mr. Leland should not receive the three-level reduction for

 acceptance of responsibility under USSG § 3C1.1.        Id. at 69.   The Government

 contended that Mr. Leland had breached the Plea Agreement by frivolously filing his

 motion to withdraw his guilty plea and falsely contending that he was actually

 innocent of the charged crimes. Id. The Government also noted that as the Court

 had imposed the obstruction of justice enhancement, the Guidelines provide that

 acceptance of responsibility should ordinarily not be given. Id.

       The Court denied the acceptance of responsibility reduction because following

 the guilty plea, Mr. Leland had repeatedly falsely claimed his innocence in letters to

 the Court and by filing his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Id. at 73-78.

                     c.   Criminal History




                                           13
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 14 of 76         PageID #: 1465



       At the sentencing hearing, counsel agreed that Mr. Leland was a criminal

 history category I, not II as was set forth in the PSR. Id. at 78.

                     d.     Guideline Calculations

       The Court found the base offense level to be 32. Id. at 81-82. The Court applied

 the following enhancements: (1) a four-level organizer or leader enhancement under

 USSG § 3B1.1(a), and (2) a two-level obstruction of justice enhancement under USSG

 § 3C1.1. Id. at 82. The Court declined to apply the two-level dangerous weapons

 enhancement, and declined to allow a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Id.

 The total offense level was 38 and the criminal history category was I, resulting in a

 Guideline sentence of 235 to 293 months. Id. The Court imposed a 252-month

 sentence in the lower end of the applicable Guideline sentence range. Id. at 102.

       B.     Fourteen Post-Trial Motions

       Mr. Leland has never accepted the 252-month sentence and has kept the courts

 and Government busy responding to his numerous legal challenges to the sentence;

 in particular, he rankles at the Court’s obstruction of justice and acceptance of

 responsibility conclusions and has waged an unremitting and determined effort to

 force the Court to alter its judgment and impose a more lenient sentence.

       First, on October 31, 2005, he appealed to the First Circuit Court of Appeals

 the Court’s denial of his motion to withdraw the guilty pleas and he complained about

 the asserted ineffectiveness of his prior counsel. On September 22, 2006, the First

 Circuit rejected Mr. Leland’s complaint about the motion to withdraw his guilty pleas

 and concluded that his arguments about ineffective counsel were premature; it



                                           14
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 15 of 76          PageID #: 1466



 affirmed the judgment of conviction and sentence. United States v. Leland, 196 Fed.

 App’x 9 (1st Cir. 2006).

       Second, on January 29, 2007, acting on the First Circuit’s suggestion, Mr.

 Leland moved to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §

 2255. Leland v. United States, Docket No. 07-10-JAW, Mot. Under 28 U.S.C. § 2255

 to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence by a Person in Federal Custody (ECF No. 1).

 In that filing, Mr. Leland objected to the fact that he was not allowed to withdraw his

 guilty pleas and he says that he tried to appeal that decision but his lawyer failed to

 prosecute it after filing the notice of appeal. Id. at 5. He also complained that his

 attorney had convinced him to plead guilty and that he did not understand that in

 entering into the plea agreement, he was waiving his rights. Id. at 6. Mr. Leland

 finally contended that his lawyer delayed the filing of the motion to withdraw the

 guilty pleas and that the courts had held that delay against him in denying his

 motion. Id. at 8.

       The Court referred this motion to the Magistrate Judge for a recommended

 decision and on June 13, 2007, the Magistrate Judge issued an eleven-page decision,

 recommending that the § 2255 motion be denied. Recommended Decision on 28

 U.S.C. § 2255 Mot. (ECF No. 8). On June 20, 2007, Mr. Leland moved for this Judge

 to recuse himself from ruling on the § 2255 motion and objected to the Recommended

 Decision. Mot. for Recusal (ECF No. 9); Def.’s Objections to Recommended Decision

 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B) (ECF No. 10). On July 5, 2007, the Court issued a six-page

 ruling, affirming the Recommended Decision and denying the motion to recuse.



                                           15
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 16 of 76        PageID #: 1467



 Order on Pl.’s Mot. for Recusal and on Magistrate Judge’s Recommended Decision

 (ECF No. 13). Mr. Leland appealed that Order to the First Circuit Court of Appeals,

 Notice of Appeal (ECF No. 16), and on December 17, 2007, the First Circuit Court of

 Appeals denied his appeal in a brief opinion. J. (ECF No. 23).

        Third, on September 24, 2008, Mr. Leland moved for a sentence reduction. Def.

 William Leland’s Pro Se Mot. for Sentence Reduction (ECF No. 350). The basis of his

 motion was that the Court erred when it imposed the two-level obstruction of justice

 enhancement and denied the three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility

 and Mr. Leland urged the Court to impose the ten-year mandatory minimum term of

 incarceration. Id. at 1-7. In his motion, Mr. Leland repeatedly mentioned that AUSA

 Perry had told the Court that the Government was not seeking the enhancement. Id.

 at 1-2. He also claimed that he had no idea how the DEA information had ended up

 in Thomas Dunroe’s Hampden home and speculated that a man named Lance

 Palmer, apparently a friend of Mr. Dunroe’s, who was an inmate at the Maine State

 Prison while Mr. Leland was there, may have taken the discovery. Id. at 2-3. Mr.

 Leland also claimed that he should have been accorded acceptance of responsibility.

 Id. at 4-6.

        On October 28, 2008, the Court denied Mr. Leland’s motion for sentence

 reduction. Order Denying Def.’s William Leland’s Pro Se Mot. for Sentence Reduction

 (ECF No. 354). Stating for the first time what was to become a recurring theme, the

 Court explained to Mr. Leland that “the law severely constrains the ability of the

 sentencing court to reduce a sentence and the grounds upon which it may do so.” Id.



                                          16
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 17 of 76          PageID #: 1468



 at 3. The Court quoted 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c) as stating the general rule that a “court

 may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed.” Id. The Court

 then reviewed the narrow circumstances that the law allows a sentencing judge to

 revisit a sentence and determined that none of those circumstances was present in

 Mr. Leland’s case. Id. Finally, the Court observed that Mr. Leland had the right to

 challenge his sentence under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, but that he had already unsuccessfully

 done so, and the law requires him to obtain the approval of the appellate court before

 filing a second or successive § 2255 petition. Id. at 3-4.

       Fourth, on November 5, 2009, Mr. Leland filed an application for leave to file

 a second or successive motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Appl.

 for Leave to File a Second or Successive Mot. to Vacate, Set Aside or Correct Sentence

 Under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 by a Prisoner in Federal Custody (ECF No. 356). But Mr.

 Leland apparently quickly thought the better of it and withdrew the petition.

 Withdrawal of Appl. for Leave to File a Second or Successive Mot. to Vacate, Set Aside,

 or Correct Sentence Under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (ECF No. 357).

       Fifth, perhaps taking a cue from the Court’s October 28, 2008 opinion, Mr.

 Leland attempted to obtain the First Circuit Court of Appeals’ approval to file a

 second or successive petition under § 2255 based on newly discovered evidence and

 on December 10, 2009, the First Circuit denied his application, explaining that

 because the new evidence relates to sentencing issues and has no bearing on his

 conviction, it “does not meet the stringent gatekeeping requirements applicable to

 successive § 2255 petitions.” J. at 1 (ECF No. 359).



                                            17
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 18 of 76           PageID #: 1469



       Sixth, having failed to obtain the approval of the First Circuit Court of Appeals,

 on January 6, 2010, Mr. Leland returned to this Court in an attempt to obtain

 approval for a second or successive motion to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.

 Appl. for Leave to File a Second or Successive Mot. to Vacate, Set Aside or Correct

 Sentence Under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 by a Prisoner in Federal Custody (ECF No. 360). On

 February 9, 2010, the Court denied Mr. Leland’s application for a second or successive

 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Order on

 Appl. for Leave to File a Second or Successive Mot. to Vacate, Set Aside or Correct

 Sentence Under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 by a Prisoner in Fed. Custody (ECF No. 363). Again,

 on February 9, 2010, in a six-page decision, the Court explained to Mr. Leland that it

 was “without authority to act on his petition.” Id. at 4-5. This was because Mr.

 Leland’s direct appeal had been denied and his first § 2255 petition had been denied

 as well. Id. The Court quoted the authorizing statute:

       Before a second or successive application permitted by this section is
       filed in the district court, the applicant shall move in the appropriate
       court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider
       the application.

 Id. at 5 (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(3)(A)). In other words, the Court explained to

 Mr. Leland, “[b]efore this Court may act on his petition, the Court of Appeals must

 first act favorably; here, the Court of Appeals has acted but unfavorably.” Id.

       Seventh, on March 29, 2010, Mr. Leland filed another motion for resentencing.

 Mot. for Resentencing (ECF No. 364). In this motion, he reiterated his position that

 he knew nothing about Thomas Dunroe, that he merited a ten-year mandatory

 minimum sentence, that he had made progress in jail and had learned his lesson, and

                                           18
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 19 of 76                      PageID #: 1470



 that the Court should “find it in your heart” to consider resentencing him. Id. at 1-4.

 He attached an affidavit from Thomas Dunroe, who swore that he does not know Mr.

 Leland, never met him, and never received anything in the mail from him. Id. Attach.

 1, Aff. of Thomas Dunroe at 1 (First Dunroe Aff.). On March 30, 2010, the Court

 denied Mr. Leland’s motion. Order Denying Pro Se Mot. to Reduce Sentence (ECF No.

 365). In an eight-page opinion, the Court noted that it had already issued two orders

 in which it had explained to him that it did not have the authority to reduce his

 sentence, but it again reviewed the narrow circumstances where the law grants a

 sentencing judge such authority and found that none of those circumstances applied.

 Id. at 1-8. The Court ended by stating:

        The Court takes Mr. Leland at his word and congratulates him for his
        post-incarceration efforts at rehabilitation, but those efforts will have to
        be their own reward.

 Id. at 7-8.

        Eighth, on June 23, 2010, Mr. Leland filed a motion to reduce sentence under

 Rule 60. Mot. for Relief from a Final J. Under Rule 60(b)/(d) (ECF No. 366). He

 again attached an affidavit from Thomas Dunroe that contained essentially the same

 information as the affidavit attached to the March 29, 2010 motion. 1 Id. Attach. 1,




 1       On close examination, the first and second affidavits appear to be signed by different people
 despite the fact that both were supposedly signed on February 12, 2009 by Thomas Dunroe.
         In the first affidavit, Mr. Dunroe misspells his own last name. He adds an “s” to Dunroe,
 making his last name “Dunroes.” In the second affidavit, he correctly spells his last name—without
 the “s”. Furthermore, even though the signatures may be the handwriting of the same person, there
 are subtle odd differences between the Dunroe signatures on both affidavits. See First Dunroe Aff. at
 2; Second Dunroe Aff. at 2.
         Equally odd, the signatures of “Rose Marie Brooks”, the notary public before whom both
 affidavits were signed, are entirely different and do not appear to be those of the same person. See
 First Dunroe Aff. at 2; Second Dunroe Aff. at 2.

                                                  19
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 20 of 76          PageID #: 1471



 Aff. of Thomas Dunroe at 1 (Second Dunroe Aff.). Also, Mr. Leland denied that his

 letter to “David” about Robert Stewart was threatening. Id. at 2. On September 7,

 2010, the Court denied this motion. Order Denying Mot. for Relief from Final J.

 Under Rule 60(b)/(d) (ECF No. 371). The Court explained again in detail that it did

 not have the authority to reduce his sentence, but it also addressed his assertion that

 the letter to Mr. Stewart was not threatening. Id. at 1-6. The Court pointed out that

 in the letter, Mr. Leland had called Mr. Steward a “bastard” and a “rat”, that he said

 Mr. Stewart had “told a lot of lies about me”, that Mr. McDougal and Mr. Stewart had

 been “rats for a long time”. Id. at 3. Mr. Leland also told “David” that the “club” did

 not support him because of “them”, presumably Mr. Stewart and Mr. McDougal, and

 now the club “knows the difference.” Id. Mr. Leland prayed that he would encounter

 Mr. Stewart in prison so that he could “show the asshole what tough is.” Id.

       In the opinion, the Court noted that other courts had imposed an obstruction

 of justice enhancement in similar situations and that this Court had done so in

 another case as well. Id. (citing United States v. Belskis, 477 F. Supp. 2d 237, 244-47

 (D. Me. 2007) (applying the obstruction of justice enhancement when the defendant

 called a confidential informant, accused her of being a DEA agent, and told her she

 was “going to fucking get it”). But more to the point, the Court noted that Mr. Leland

 “keeps filing the same motion, earnestly repeating his contention about the Dunroe

 papers.” Id. at 5. The Court commented that it “remained convinced that Mr. Leland

 knows full well that he was very angry with Mr. Stewart and that he threatened to

 harm him.” Id. The Court concluded, “[i]n short, for the last time, the Court cannot



                                           20
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 21 of 76          PageID #: 1472



 grant Mr. Leland’s repeated motions because it does not have the authority to change

 his sentence and because if it could, it would not.” Id. at 6.

       Ninth, undeterred, on September 24, 2010, Mr. Leland moved this Court to

 reconsider its order denying his motion for Rule 60 relief. Pro Se Appl. to Recons.

 Pet’r’s Rule 60(b) (d) Mot. (ECF No. 374). On October 29, 2010, the Court denied the

 motion. Order Denying Mot. for Recons. (ECF No. 376).

       Tenth, on November 15, 2010. Mr. Leland filed the same motion for

 reconsideration with the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. Pro Se Mot. for Relief

 Under 60(b) (d) (ECF No. 377). Once the Court determined that Mr. Leland had filed

 the motion as a duplicate in this Court, the Court struck the motion on December 22,

 2010. Order to Strike Mot. to Reduce Sentence (ECF No. 381).

       Eleventh, on November 23, 2011, Mr. Leland filed a motion to amend the PSR

 on the ground that his sentence violated the terms of the Plea Agreement and that

 the PSR attributed “ghost drugs”, namely drugs supplied by someone else and

 distributed by other members of his conspiracy.        Pet. to Amend the Presentence

 Investigation Report at 2-5 (ECF No. 382). Mr. Leland also asserted that Deputy

 Chief Julie Morse of the District of Maine PO informed him that this Court “has the

 jurisdiction to amend the P.S.I.” and that she further agreed that his objections were

 “not resolved prior to sentencing.” Id. at 4-5 (emphasis in original). On January 4,

 2012, the Court denied Mr. Leland’s motion to amend the PSR. Order on Mot. to

 Amend Presentence Report (ECF No. 384). The Court noted that Mr. Leland had

 raised the Plea Agreement issue numerous times before, that it had been consistently



                                            21
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 22 of 76          PageID #: 1473



 rejected, and that the drug quantity calculation was consistent with the precise terms

 of the Plea Agreement. Id. at 2-3. The Court also noted that it was too late for Mr.

 Leland to raise questions about drug quantity and that he should have done so when

 he appealed his sentence to the Court of Appeals. Id. at 3. Finally, the Court rejected

 Mr. Leland’s characterization of Deputy Chief Morse’s September 19, 2011 letter and

 the Court reiterated that it does not have the authority to rewrite a PSR over six

 years after a sentencing. Id. at 4.

       Twelfth, on January 19, 2012, Mr. Leland filed a motion for downward

 departure. Mot. for Downward Departure Based on Extra Ordinary Confinement of

 Fed. Inmate in a Non-Federal Pre-Trial Institution (ECF No. 385). Citing United

 States v. Brinton, 139 F.3d 718 (9th Cir. 1998), Mr. Leland suggested that because he

 was held in state prison during pretrial and presentencing phases, he should have

 received a downward departure. Id. at 1-7. On March 5, 2012, the Court denied his

 motion. Order on Mot. for Downward Departure (ECF No. 388). The Court reminded

 Mr. Leland that it does not have the authority to reduce his sentence. Id. at 2. It

 noted that in any event, the Brinton case would not have provided him any relief

 because the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals expressed skepticism about a district

 judge’s decision to downward depart to account for time the defendant had spent in

 state prison and the Ninth Circuit instructed the sentencing judge to reconsider the

 ruling. Id. at 2-3.

       Thirteenth, on February 23, 2012, Mr. Leland filed a motion for order of

 transfer. Mot. for Order of Transfer (ECF No. 387). In that motion, Mr. Leland asked



                                           22
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 23 of 76            PageID #: 1474



 the Court to order the Bureau of Prisons to transfer him either to state prison in

 Maine or to federal prison in Berlin, New Hampshire. Id. at 1-5. On April 11, 2012,

 the Court denied Mr. Leland’s motion, explaining that the Bureau of Prisons, not the

 sentencing judge, has the authority to place an inmate. Id. at 1-3.

       Fourteenth, on February 3, 2014, the First Circuit Court of Appeals denied Mr.

 Leland’s motion to correct sentence, noting that the motion was “in substance an

 application for leave to file a second or successive application under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.”

 J. at 1 (ECF No. 391).

       C.     The Fifteenth Motion: Petition for Writ of Audita Querela

       Mr. Leland’s fifteenth motion before either this Court or the Court of Appeals

 is his motion for writ of audita querela. Pet. for Writ of Audita Querela Pursuant to

 the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651 (ECF No. 392) (Def.’s Pet.). In his petition, Mr.

 Leland says that “two (2) men were in prison and unavailable at the time of

 sentencing that have since been freed and have signed sworn affidavits to prove

 Petitioner did not commit Obstruction of Justice.” Id. at 2. He maintains that “the

 Sixth Amendment requires juries, not judges, find facts relevant to sentencing.” Id.

 Mr. Leland again denies knowing Thomas Dunroe or sending discovery to him and

 he again insists that his letter to Robert Stewart was not threatening. Id. at 6-7. Mr.

 Leland says that he entered into an oral plea agreement and that oral and written

 plea agreements are different. Id. at 6, 8. Mr. Leland then argues that Attorney

 Largay, his initial counsel, and Attorney Napolitano, his second lawyer, were

 ineffective. Id. at 10-11. He asked the Court to reduce his sentence to “time served”



                                            23
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 24 of 76         PageID #: 1475



 or 159 months. Id. at 12. Mr. Leland asserts that the Court erred in relying on

 statements in the PSR that he contested, that the Court’s enhancement findings were

 insufficient, and that his sentence is too disparate from the sentences of other

 members of the conspiracy.      Id. at 13-17.    Finally, Mr. Leland recalculates his

 sentence omitting the two-level obstruction of justice enhancement, granting the

 three-level acceptance of responsibility reduction, and reducing his sentence in

 accordance with Amendment 782, resulting in a new Guideline range of 108 to 135

 months. Id. at 18. He requests “immediate release.” Id.

       D.      The Court’s Order on the Petition for Writ of Audita Querela

       On January 14, 2015, citing eleven of its prior orders, the Court denied Mr.

 Leland’s petition for writ of audita querela, Order on Pet. for Writ of Audita Querela

 Pursuant to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651 (ECF No. 407).

       E.      Motion for Reconsideration

       On February 6, 2015, Mr. Leland filed a motion for reconsideration. Mot. to

 Recons. Pet’r’s Writ of Audita Querela Pursuant to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651

 (ECF No. 408) (Def.’s Mot.). Mr. Leland complains bitterly that the “merits of this

 motion have never been ruled on.” Id. at 1 (emphasis in original). He argues:

       1) He has “repeatedly submitted ‘4’ four sworn affidavits proving he did

            not commit what the court said he did, which was obstruction of

            justice;” id.;

       2) The “prosecutor told the court multiple times that the government

            did not seek the enhancement;” id.;



                                           24
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 25 of 76           PageID #: 1476



       3) Mr. Leland “has submitted Supreme Court caselaw that states that

          a judge is an impartial arbiter and should only rule on the charges

          brought on by the government;” id. at 1-2;

       4) Mr. Leland “has submitted caselaw that states that informing

          someone that they are under investigation is not Obstruction of

          Justice,” that he “didn’t do that as the court accused him, but even if

          he did, it is not Obstruction of Justice,” id. at 2;

       5) Mr. Leland is “claiming Robert Napolitano was ineffective in these

          motions, yet the government is misleading this court by telling you

          that you’ve ruled on this allegation already. When in fact, this court

          has ruled on the case petitioner filed against Chris Largay,

          petitioner’s first counsel,” id.;

       6) Mr. Leland says he was “deprived of this right to Due Process when

          the court surprised him and the prosecutor when he was charged

          with the crime of Obstruction of Justice at his sentencing. Petitioner

          was not allowed to defend himself against these charges.           The

          prosecutor objected, but the court wouldn’t listen.” Id. (emphasis in

          original);

       7) Mr. Leland says he is a pro se litigant and therefore, if he mislabeled

          his motion, the Court has the obligation to “re-label it and either rule

          on the merits of his motion or send it to the proper court so that they

          can rule on the merits of his motion. That has never happen[ed]!

             That is why this petitioner has filed motion after motion.” Id. at 3

             (emphasis in original);

       8) Mr. Leland says that he is “Not Guilty of Obstruction of Justice and

             should not be doing 21 years in prison when he was promised by the

             United States Government that he would receive the minimum

             mandatory 10 year sentence. Id. (emphasis in original);

       9) Mr. Leland asserts that “[i]f the court would only rule on the merits

             and look at the proof that petitioner keeps submitting to this court,

             petitioner would never file another motion.” Id.

       F.       A Letter Writing Campaign

       With Mr. Leland’s motion for reconsideration, the Court received numerous

 letters from his family and friends, asking the Court to impose a time served

 sentence:

       1) Letter dated February 15, 2015 from “Goodin” signed by “a concerned

             community member, friend, a mother, a family member”;

       2) Letter dated February 24, 2015 from Matt Leland, Mr. Leland’s youngest

             brother;

       3) Letter dated February 23, 2015 from Linda M. Smithson;

       4) Letter undated from Thomas B. Leland, Mr. Leland’s brother;

       5) Letter dated February 23, 2015 from Stacey Leland, Mr. Leland’s sister in

             law;

       6) Letter dated February 23, 2015 from Brenda O’Brien, Mr. Leland’s cousin;

        7) Letter dated February 24, 2015 from Molly Dunbar;

        8) Letter undated from Virginia King, mother in law to Mr. Leland’s brother;

             and

        9) Letter undated from Allie Wilcox, Sr.

 II.    DISCUSSION

        The Court disagrees with Mr. Leland’s remonstration that it has never

 explained why it cannot change his sentence. This Court and the Court of Appeals

 have issued ruling after ruling, explaining that once a defendant exhausts a direct

 appeal and once a defendant has filed an unsuccessful habeas corpus petition under

 § 2255, the sentencing judge has virtually no authority to alter an imposed sentence.

 Nevertheless, the Court will again set forth why it cannot legally change Mr. Leland’s

 sentence for the reasons he has cited and why those reasons are in any event

 insufficient.

        A.    The Writ of Audita Querela

        “The writ of audita querela, introduced during the reign of Edward III, is

 sometimes available to reopen a judgment when an important matter concerning a

 defendant’s case has arisen since the entry of judgment.” Trenkler v. United States,

 536 F.3d 85, 90 n.2 (1st Cir. 2008). The First Circuit described a writ of audita

 querela, part of the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651, as “‘a common law writ

 constituting the initial process in an action brought by a judgment defendant to

 obtain relief against the consequences of the judgment on account of some matter of

 defense or discharge arising since its rendition and which could not be taken



                                          27
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 28 of 76                         PageID #: 1479



 advantage of otherwise.’”2 United States v. Holder, 936 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1991)

 (quoting BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 120 (5th ed. 1979)). In Holder, the First Circuit

 explained:

         [I]f available at all [in criminal proceedings], the writ of audita querela
         can only be available where there is a legal objection to a conviction,
         which has arisen subsequent to that conviction, and which is not
         redressable pursuant to another post-conviction remedy.

 Id. at 5 (emphasis in original).3 Put differently, to obtain relief under audita querela,

 a defendant must point to something “occurring since his conviction that would

 render his conviction illegal.” Id. To assume that the writ could be available in some

 cases, however, does not mean that it is available in Mr. Leland’s case.4

         In any case, it is not. Although the First Circuit has stated that the writ of

 audita querela may be available to “reopen a judgment when an important matter

 concerning a defendant’s case has arisen since entry of the judgment”, Trenkler, 536



 2        The Holder Court noted that the writ of audita querela has been abolished under the civil
 rules. Holder, 936 F.2d at 2 (citing FED. R. CIV. P. 60(b) (now (e)). However, the First Circuit observed
 that in 1954, the United States Supreme Court held that the writ of coram nobis was still available in
 criminal proceedings and the First Circuit concluded that the writ of audita querela may still be
 available in criminal proceedings. Id.
 3        The First Circuit did not rule that the writ of audita querela is viable. The First Circuit
 “emphasize[d] that nothing herein is meant to suggest our affirmative resolution of the difficult
 question of the survival and availability of this ancient and some might think outmoded writ.” Holder,
 936 F.2d at 2. Following the First Circuit’s lead, the Court assumes without deciding that a writ of
 audita querela is potentially available to Mr. Leland.
          A cousin of the writ of audita querela is the writ of coram nobis. The difference between the
 writ of coram nobis and the writ of audita querela is considered to be one of timing. The writ of coram
 nobis may be used by a rendering court to “correct its own judgment on the basis of some patent error
 affecting the validity or regularity of that judgment.” Trenkler, 536 F.3d at 90 n.2. As noted, the writ
 of audita querela, in contrast, may be available to “reopen a judgment when an important matter
 concerning a defendant’s case has arisen since entry of the judgment.” Id.
 4        Mr. Leland cites Kessack v. United States, No. CO5-1828Z, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7739 (W.D.
 Wash. Jan. 18, 2008) as support for his petition. Def.’s Pet. at 1. However, as the district court in
 Rhode Island observed, Kessack’s “holding that the unavailability of § 2255 relief justifies proceeding
 under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651, is contrary to the law of this circuit.” Manjarres v. United
 States, CR No. 00-049-ML, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36214, at *15 (D.R.I. Apr. 13, 2010).

                                                   28
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 29 of 76                         PageID #: 1480



 F.3d at 90 n.2, the Court has noted that the writ of audita querela “does not and

 cannot, under any stretch of imagination, provide a purely equitable basis for relief

 independent of any legal defect in the underlying judgment”, Holder, 936 F.3d at *3.

         The First Circuit further explained that a writ of audita querela is not

 available to a petitioner when other remedies, such as a § 2255 petition, exist. See

 Trenkler, 536 F.3d at 97 (“[W]hen a statute—like section 2255—specifically addresses

 a particular class of claims or issues, it is that statute, not the All Writs Act, that

 takes precedence. The armamentarium of common-law writs . . . is thus available

 only to fill whatever interstices exist in the post-conviction remedial scheme made

 available to federal prisoners by way of section 2255.” (internal citation omitted)).

 The First Circuit directed, “[w]here a prisoner has filed a motion for relief under one

 of the common law writs, the court must examine the substance of the motion to

 determine whether the claim is one that would be cognizable under section 2255.”

 United States v. Rivera-Lebron, 410 Fed. Appx. 352, 353 (1st Cir. 2011).5

         The first problem is that to the extent Mr. Leland has raised or could have

 raised these issues, he cannot raise them again through a writ of audita querela and

 to the extent he has not raised them previously, he must pursue his claims under §

 2255. With one possible exception, all of the issues that Mr. Leland lists in his motion

 for writ of audita querela and his motion for reconsideration are equitable, were

 available to him at the time of sentencing, and could have been presented either to



 5       Even if the Court were to conclude that Mr. Leland’s claims are cognizable under § 2255, Mr.
 Leland has already filed multiple § 2255 petitions, and to the extent that he wishes to file a successive
 petition, he must first obtain approval from the First Circuit. See 28 U.S.C. § 2255(h).

                                                    29
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 30 of 76                        PageID #: 1481



 the Court of Appeals on direct appeal or to this Court and the Court of Appeals under

 his § 2255 petition.6

        As of October 2005 or shortly thereafter, Mr. Leland was aware: (1) that the

 Court, not a jury, had made the Guideline determinations; (2) that he maintained

 that he had not sent the investigative material to Mr. Dunroe, (3) that he contended

 he had entered into a so-called oral plea agreement, (4) that he thought his first

 lawyer had been ineffective, (5) that he thought his second lawyer had been

 ineffective, (6) that he believed the Court had relied on the PSR to make factual

 findings, (7) that he believed the Court had failed to adequately explain its rulings,

 (8) that the prosecutor had told the Court that the Government was not seeking the

 obstruction of justice enhancement, (9) that in his view, the Court had ruled on issues

 not raised by the parties, (10) that in his view, sharing investigative material with a

 third person is not obstruction of justice, and (11) that he said he did not know about

 the obstruction of justice possibility until the sentencing hearing.

        Here, Mr. Leland points to nothing occurring “subsequent to the conviction”

 that would render it illegal, thus rendering his petition and motion eligible for

 dismissal under audita querela on that basis alone. See Holder, 936 F.2d at 5.

 Whatever else may be said about these issues, Mr. Leland knew about them a long

 time ago and nearly fifteen years after his sentence, he demands that the Court rule




 6       The only possible exception is his later procuring of the affidavits from Mr. Dunroe and others
 about the dissemination of investigative material, which the Court separately addresses. But Mr.
 Leland’s “‘4’ four sworn affidavits” supposedly “proving he did not commit what the court said he did,
 which was Obstruction of Justice” are new facts, not new law, and the Supreme Court and the First
 Circuit require new law for a writ of audita querela. Morgan, 346 U.S. at 511; Hager, 993 F.2d at 5.

                                                   30
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 31 of 76         PageID #: 1482



 on them pursuant to a petition for a writ of audita querela. None of the issues he

 raises presents the Court with law that has changed since his sentencing.

       Nevertheless, because Mr. Leland is a pro se defendant, the Court considers

 his claims as if filed as a petition for a writ of coram nobis, which was available at

 common law to correct errors of fact, see United States v. Morgan, 346 U.S. 502, 507

 (1954)..

       Addressing coram nobis, the First Circuit set forth the applicable standards:

       [T]he writ of coram nobis is an unusual legal animal that courts will use
       to set aside a criminal judgment of conviction only “under circumstances
       compelling such action to achieve justice.”

 Hager v. United States, 993 F.2d 4, 5 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting Morgan, 346 U.S. at

 511). The Hager Court explained:

       Those circumstances include an explanation of why a coram nobis
       petitioner did not earlier seek relief from the judgment, a showing that
       the petitioner continues to suffer significant collateral consequences
       from the judgment, and a demonstration that an error of “the most
       fundamental character,” relevant to the plea decision, occurred.

 Id. (quoting in part Morgan, 346 U.S. at 512); Manjarres, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS

 36214, at *14.

       The Court accepts for purposes of this Order that Mr. Leland is suffering

 “significant collateral consequences” from the errors he contends the Court has made.

 It turns therefore to whether these purported errors were in fact errors at all, much

 less errors of “a fundamental character.” Id.

       B.     Claimed Errors

              1.    The Role of the Judge in Guideline Findings



                                          31
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 32 of 76         PageID #: 1483



       In his motion, Mr. Leland says that “the Sixth Amendment requires juries, not

 judges, to find facts relevant to sentencing.” Def.’s Pet. at 2. He is wrong. The

 Supreme Court has determined that juries, not judges, must find facts relevant to the

 application of a statutory maximum and a statutory minimum. Apprendi v. New

 Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000) (statutory maximum); Alleyne v. United States, 133 S. Ct.

 2151 (2013) (statutory minimum). The basis of the Supreme Court’s rulings is that

 “any fact that, by law, increases the penalty for a crime is an ‘element’ that must be

 submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt.” Butterworth v. United

 States, 775 F.3d 459, 462 (1st Cir. 2015) (quoting Alleyne, 133 S. Ct. at 2155). The

 First Circuit has distinguished jury findings that determine statutory maximums and

 minimums from judicial findings that determine the application of provisions of

 advisory Guideline provisions. United States v. Correy, 773 F.3d 276, 280 n.4 (1st

 Cir. 2014) (“[F]actual findings made for purposes of applying the Guidelines, which

 influence the sentencing judge’s discretion in imposing an advisory Guidelines

 sentence and do not result in the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence, do

 not violate the rule in Alleyne”).

              2.     Claimed Surprise and Due Process Deprivation

       Mr. Leland’s next contention is that he was “deprived of his right to Due

 Process when the court surprised him and the prosecutor when he was charged with

 the crime of Obstruction of Justice at his sentencing. Petitioner was not allowed to




                                          32
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 33 of 76                           PageID #: 1484



 defend himself against these charges. The prosecutor objected, but the court wouldn’t

 listen.” Def.’s Mot. at 2 (emphasis in Defendant’s motion). This is simply not correct.7

         The PSR contained the following statement in paragraph 60:

         In March 2004, following his guilty plea, defendant Leland wrote a letter
         to members of the Hell’s Angels noting his desire to cause bodily injury
         to codefendant, Robert Stewart, as Stewart provided incriminating
         information to authorities regarding Leland. Therefore, the defendant,
         directly or indirectly, attempted to threaten, intimidate or otherwise
         unlawfully influence a codefendant or witness. Further, in March 2004,
         defendant Leland disseminated discovery material to others, including
         prison inmates, known felons in the community and other Hell’s Angels.

 PSR ¶ 60. In the PSR, the PO recommended application of the two-level obstruction

 of justice enhancement. Id. ¶ 70. The PSR confirmed that Mr. Leland objected to the

 application of the obstruction of justice enhancement. Id.; Second Addendum to the

 PSR dated October 19, 2005 at 2.

         On October 24, 2005, the Court held a presentence conference with counsel,

 including Mr. Leland’s new lawyer, Robert Napolitano, to discuss issues likely to

 come up at Mr. Leland’s sentencing. Presentence Conf. Tr. at 1-31. Contrary to Mr.

 Leland’s contention that the obstruction of justice enhancement first arose at the

 sentencing hearing itself, the PO’s recommendation of an obstruction of justice

 enhancement was a primary issue under discussion at the Presentence Conference.




 7        Mr. Leland is correct only about the allegations involving Omar and Don Grace. These
 allegations arose after the presentence conference. But he is simply incorrect that the possibility of
 an obstruction of justice enhancement arose for the first time at the sentencing hearing. The record
 reflects that the Court engaged in a detailed discussion about the possibility of an obstruction of justice
 enhancement at the presentence conference before the sentencing hearing based on the contents of the
 revised PSR, which itself had been available before the presentence conference.

                                                    33
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 34 of 76         PageID #: 1485



 Id. at 5:25-9:3. At the Presentence Conference, the Court characterized the parties’

 positions:

       THE COURT:

       Let’s turn to the next question here, and let me be - - let me try and
       understand what remains in terms of the objections and what doesn’t.
       Under the terms of the presentence investigation report, there has been
       a recommendation that an obstruction of justice enhancement apply to
       Mr. Leland on two bases: First, a letter that he wrote about Robert
       Stewart, a codefendant; and second, an allegation that he disseminated
       discovery that had been provided to him by the government prior to trial
       and prior, obviously, to the plea.

       The defendant, as I understand it, has objected to the application of the
       obstruction of justice enhancement on two grounds: First, that the letter
       about Mr. Stewart is not as some would interpret it to be; and, secondly,
       that he didn’t disseminate discovery, rather, the discovery was stolen
       from his cell.

       And the government, as I understand it, has taken the position that
       under the terms of its plea agreement it cannot argue for obstruction.

       Have I correctly stated the positions of the parties?

       MR. NAPOLITANO: Yes - -

       MR. PERRY: That’s correct, Your Honor.

       MR. NAPOLITANO: - - at least that’s my position.

 Id. at 5:25-6:21. The Court informed counsel that if Mr. Leland objected to the

 contents of the PSR either regarding the letter about Mr. Stewart or the

 dissemination of discovery, the Court “will have no factual basis upon which to make

 a decision about obstruction unless somebody presents evidence to me.” Id. at 7:18-

 24. Mr. Napolitano confirmed that “that would be his position.” Id. at 7:25.




                                          34
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 35 of 76            PageID #: 1486



       To place the parties’ positions into context, the Government entered into a Plea

 Agreement with Mr. Leland, which in Section Three contained a number of

 agreements about what the Government would recommend to the Court at the

 sentencing hearing. Plea Agreement at 4-5.       The Plea Agreement also specifically

 provided that “[t]he parties agree not to seek any further additions or reductions to

 the guidelines, other than those set forth in section Three. The parties agree not to

 seek nor recommend any upward or downward departures.”               Id. at 5.   At the

 Presentence Conference, AUSA Perry indicated to the Court that the Government

 viewed the Plea Agreement as prohibiting its support of the PO’s obstruction of justice

 enhancement.     Presentence Conf. Tr. at 7:11-12 (“Under the terms of the plea

 agreement, we are not advocating that obstruction . . . .”).

       In light of the Government’s position, the Court raised the question of how it

 could rule on the applicability of the obstruction enhancement if Mr. Leland, which

 he promised to do, objected to the contents of the PSR. Id. at 7:16-24 (THE COURT:

 “I don’t know what the facts are, and I - - if Mr. Leland at the time of sentencing says,

 look, I don’t agree with the terms - - what is contained in the presentence

 investigation report regarding either the letter to Mr. Stewart - - about Mr. Stewart

 or the dissemination of discovery, then I will have no factual basis upon which to

 make a decision about obstruction unless somebody presents evidence to me”). AUSA

 Perry said that he needed time to “mull over” the Government’s position on whether

 it could present evidence on obstruction of justice to the Court at the sentencing

 hearing without violating the terms of the Plea Agreement. Id. at 8:19-21.



                                            35
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 36 of 76         PageID #: 1487



       At the sentencing hearing, AUSA Perry observed that paragraph five of the

 Plea Agreement allowed the Government to present evidence to the Court, if the

 Court requested it and therefore, he proceeded to move a series of exhibits into

 evidence concerning the PO’s obstruction of justice enhancement. Sentencing Tr. at

 56-60. Mr. Leland’s counsel did not object to the admission of any of the Government’s

 exhibits. Id. at 59-60. After the Government’s exhibits were admitted into evidence,

 the Court specifically asked Mr. Leland’s counsel whether he had anything further

 on this issue and Attorney Napolitano responded: “No, your Honor, not at this time.”

 Id. at 60. The Court reviewed the admitted exhibits, the standards for an obstruction

 of justice enhancement, and found that Mr. Leland had obstructed justice under

 USSG § 3C1.1. Id. at 60-68.

       The recited record conclusively demonstrates that Mr. Leland’s allegations

 concerning the obstruction of justice enhancement are false.         Contrary to his

 assertion, Mr. Leland’s counsel had prior notice of the PO’s obstruction of justice

 recommendation in the PSR and, at the Presentence Conference, the Court brought

 this issue to the attention of Attorney Napolitano and discussed with counsel how

 they wished to proceed. Contrary to Mr. Leland’s assertion, the prosecutor had been

 placed on notice of the potential for an obstruction of justice enhancement, had

 considered how to respond to the PO recommendation, and had presented evidence of

 the facts underlying the recommendation at the sentencing hearing. Contrary to Mr.

 Leland’s assertion, the Court did not refuse to allow Mr. Leland to defend himself. In

 fact, the Court specifically asked Attorney Napolitano whether he had anything to



                                          36
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 37 of 76           PageID #: 1488



 present on the obstruction of justice issue and Attorney Napolitano declined to

 present any evidence. Contrary to Mr. Leland’s assertion, the prosecutor did not

 object to the enhancement. Bound by the terms of the Plea Agreement not to seek

 the enhancement, AUSA Perry was careful to confirm that the Government was not

 asking the Court to impose the enhancement, but AUSA Perry never objected to the

 Court’s imposition of the enhancement. Finally, contrary to Mr. Leland’s assertion,

 the Court never refused to listen to the prosecutor or to defense counsel on the

 obstruction of justice issue. In fact, the Court solicited argument both from the

 Government and from defense counsel and both declined. Furthermore, while the

 Court was announcing its decision, both the prosecutor and defense counsel

 interrupted the Court and in one case, corrected one of the Court’s observations, and

 in another case, argued for a different interpretation of the facts. Mr. Leland’s

 accusation that the Court “wouldn’t listen” is false.

              3.     The Oral versus Written Plea Agreement

       In his petition and motion, Mr. Leland draws a distinction between an oral and

 written plea agreement. Def.’s Pet. at 6 (“Petitioner agreed to plead guilty in an oral

 plea agreement on October 27, 2005 after 2 years and 7 months in custody”)

 (emphasis in original); Id. at 8 (“The oral and written plea agreements are different”).

 He says that during his discussions with AUSA Perry leading up to his agreement to

 plead guilty, AUSA Perry made all manner of promises, including that he would

 receive a sentence of only ten years and that the federal prosecutor would not indict




                                           37
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 38 of 76           PageID #: 1489



 his son, Derek Leland.     Id..   Mr. Leland also accuses his then defense counsel,

 Christopher Largay, of deceiving him. Id. at 9.

       The Court rejects Mr. Leland’s claims. Mr. Leland’s claims of side agreements

 with the prosecution run counter to the express terms of the Plea Agreement itself:

       12. Defendant understands that there are no further or other promises
       or agreements, either express or implied, other than those contained in
       this Agreement and that none will be made except in writing signed by
       all parties.

 Plea Agreement at 7. Furthermore, Mr. Leland affirmatively represented to the Court

 that he had read the Agreement, that he understood the contents of the Agreement,

 that he had signed the Agreement voluntarily, and that in signing the Agreement, he

 intended to agree to all its terms and conditions. Rule 11 Hr’g at 19:6-20:3. Moreover,

 the Court expressly asked Mr. Leland whether the federal prosecutor had made any

 side agreements and Mr. Leland assured the Court that aside from the written plea

 agreement, no one had made any promises to him in an effort to get him to plead

 guilty and no one had made any promises to him as to what the prosecutor’s

 recommendation would be at sentencing. Id. at 25:3-6, 10-17.

       During the Rule 11 hearing, the Court repeatedly told Mr. Leland that he had

 to tell the Court the truth. Mr. Leland is now alleging that the federal prosecutor

 supposedly made promises to Mr. Leland that Mr. Leland failed to mention at the

 Rule 11 hearing and his current assertions run flatly contrary to what Mr. Leland

 repeatedly told the Court was true on January 27, 2004. Put differently, either Mr.

 Leland was not telling the truth to the Court then or he is not telling the truth to the

 Court now.

                                           38
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 39 of 76          PageID #: 1490



       The reason that the Court engages in a detailed and extensive colloquy with

 each defendant who is pleading guilty, including Mr. Leland, is to make absolutely

 certain that the defendant’s guilty plea is knowing and voluntary. To make that

 assessment, the Court must rely on a defendant telling the Court the truth at the

 time of the guilty plea; specifically at each Rule 11, the Court focuses on whether

 there are any side deals that could affect the legality of the guilty plea. Faced with

 an irreconcilable conflict between what Mr. Leland told the Court was true while

 standing before the Court on January 24, 2007 and what Mr. Leland is now telling

 the Court is true having received his sentence, there is no reason to conclude that Mr.

 Leland has demonstrated that his current version is true. The Court rejects Mr.

 Leland’s contentions that there were side deals with the prosecutor and relies on what

 Mr. Leland himself told the Court was true when he entered his guilty plea and what

 Mr. Leland himself assured the Court was true about the Plea Agreement.

              4.     Judicial Reliance on the Contents of the PSR

       In his petition, Mr. Leland instructs the Court that once “a defendant objects

 to factual statements in the PSR [as Petitioner did about threatening a codefendant

 and sending six pages of discovery to Thomas Dunroe], then the sentencing court may

 not rely on those assertions; instead the government must prove them by a

 preponderance of the evidence.” Def.’s Pet. at 14 (quoting United States v. Replogle,

 628 F.3d 1026, 1029 (8th Cir. 2011) (emphasis added by Mr. Leland)).

       First of all, the Eighth Circuit case of Replogle does not represent the law of

 the First Circuit. Under First Circuit law, a “PSR generally bears ‘sufficient indicia



                                           39
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 40 of 76             PageID #: 1491



 of reliability to permit the district court to rely on it at sentencing.” United States v.

 Prochner, 417 F.3d 54, 65-66 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting United States v. Cyr, 337 F.3d

 96, 100 (1st Cir. 2003)). Although a defendant may object to the contents of the PSR,

 “if [his] objections to the PSR are merely rhetorical and unsupported by

 countervailing proof, the district court is entitled to rely on the facts in the PSR.” Id.

 at 66 (quoting Cyr, 337 F.3d at 100). In the First Circuit, “[s]pecial weight is given to

 those portions of the PSR to which no countervailing proof is offered.” United States

 v. Sicher, 576 F.3d 64, 71 (1st Cir. 2009). Here, Mr. Leland offered no countervailing

 proof to the contents of the PSR regarding his letter about Mr. Stewart and regarding

 the discovery found by law enforcement in Mr. Dunroe’s home. Therefore, the Court

 was entitled to accept the facts in the PSR under First Circuit law.

       But more to the point, the Court did precisely what Mr. Leland now contends

 it should have done. At the Presentence Conference, even though it could have relied

 on the contents of the PSR absent countervailing evidence from Mr. Leland, the Court

 informed counsel that if Mr. Leland objected to the contents of the PSR either

 regarding the letter about Mr. Stewart or the dissemination of discovery, the Court

 “will have no factual basis upon which to make a decision about obstruction unless

 somebody presents evidence to me.” Presentence Conf. Tr. at 7:18-24. Therefore, at

 the sentencing hearing, the Government presented the Court—without objection

 from Mr. Leland—with a series of exhibits that were admitted into evidence and that

 addressed the facts underlying the PO’s recommendation that the Court impose an

 obstruction of justice enhancement. Sentencing Tr. at 56-60. The Court reviewed



                                            40
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 41 of 76          PageID #: 1492



 those exhibits and made factual findings that substantiated the imposition of an

 obstruction of justice enhancement. Id. at 60-68. As the Court complied to the letter

 with what Mr. Leland now says it should have done, he gains nothing from his

 objection.

              5.     Inadequate     Enhancement        Findings    and    Inadequate
                     Evidence

       For the first time in this long saga, Mr. Leland claims that the Court’s findings

 respecting the factual requirements for the obstruction of justice findings were

 insufficient. Def.’s Pet. at 14-16. The Court rejects this belated complaint. The

 Court’s discussion of the obstruction of justice enhancement runs eight pages.

 Sentencing Tr. at 60-68. The Court reviewed the exhibits that the Government moved

 into evidence, quoted USSG § 3C1.1, read the Commission commentary to this

 provision, and cited First Circuit caselaw in arriving at its conclusion. Id. The Court

 rejects Mr. Leland’s contention that its discussion of the obstruction of justice

 enhancement was inadequate.

       Mr. Leland asserts that “[t]he Court admits in the sentencing transcripts on

 page 57, lines 5 through 11 and again on page 60, lines 19 through 22, and for a third

 time on page 66, lines 7 & 8, that there is no evidence to support the two (2) point

 level enhancement.” Def.’s Pet. at 16. At page 57, however, the Court was referring

 to the fact that, as the Court told counsel at the presentence conference, before the

 Government admitted its exhibits into evidence, the only document before the Court

 was the PSR and if Mr. Leland objected to the admission of the exhibits, the Court

 would have no basis to make factual findings. Sentencing Tr. at 57 (“On the other

                                           41
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 42 of 76            PageID #: 1493



 hand, the Court doesn’t have any actual information other than what is set forth in

 the Presentence Investigation Report, and it is important for its own determination

 as to whether an obstruction of justice charge enhancement should be applied in this

 case to obtain the information that is appropriate. So with that understanding, you

 may proceed”). Directly after this comment, the Government moved into evidence

 numerous underlying exhibits on which the Court relied in imposing the

 enhancement. Id. at 58-60. Here, the Court was only stating what Mr. Leland earlier

 said it should have stated: that if objected to, the Court would not rely on the contents

 of the PSR alone in imposing the enhancement and would require actual evidence,

 which the Government then supplied.

       The colloquy on page 60 relates to the Court’s clarification about an assertion

 in the PSR, namely that “David”, the recipient of the Leland letter about Robert

 Stewart, was a member of the Hells Angels. Id. at 60. AUSA Perry and Attorney

 Napolitano informed the Court that “David” was not a member of the Hells Angels

 and that the Court should not draw that inference from the Leland letter. Id. at 60-

 61. The Court agreed not to do so. Id. at 61 (“All right. So I can’t make that

 inference”). Contrary to Mr. Leland’s contention, the Court did not state on page 60

 of the sentencing transcript that it had no evidence of obstruction of justice; the Court

 merely established with counsel what fair inferences it could draw from the evidence

 that was before the Court. Once counsel agreed that the Court should not infer that

 “David” was a member of the Hells Angels, the Court agreed on the record not to draw

 that inference.



                                            42
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 43 of 76          PageID #: 1494



       The reference on page 66 of the transcript to an absence of evidence bears a

 word of explanation. One of the reasons the PO recommended an obstruction of

 justice enhancement was that investigative papers AUSA Perry sent to Mr. Leland’s

 attorney, Christopher Largay, had been discovered in Thomas Dunroe’s Hampden

 home. PSR ¶ 60. In discussing this issue, the Court observed that “the information

 . . . has found its way to Thomas Dunroe who was under investigation at the time,

 and during a search of his apartment detailed information of the status of DEA

 investigations in this area was uncovered.” Sentencing Tr. at 66. The Court noted

 that “[c]learly, whoever sent that information to Mr. Dunroe had the intent to

 obstruct or interfere with an ongoing governmental investigation . . . .” Id. The Court

 identified two possible senders, Attorney Largay and Mr. Leland, and commented “I

 know of no other conclusion I could reach.” Id.

       At that point Attorney Napolitano interrupted and suggested a third

 possibility: another inmate may have sent the investigative report to Mr. Dunroe. Id.

 at 66. Attorney Napolitano agreed that there was no reason to accuse Attorney

 Largay of supplying Mr. Dunroe with this investigative information.         Id.   As a

 practical matter, this narrowed the possible senders to either Mr. Leland or to some

 unknown inmate who presumably entered Mr. Leland’s cell, stole the papers, and

 sent them to Mr. Dunroe, who was a possible target of the ongoing investigation. The

 Court observed that it was a logical inference that Mr. Leland, who presumably

 received the reports from Attorney Largay, was responsible for sending them out. Id.




                                           43
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 44 of 76          PageID #: 1495



       Rejecting Attorney Napolitano’s contention that the Court should infer that

 someone other than Mr. Leland had sent the investigative reports, the Court noted

 that “I have no evidence one way or the other on that”, meaning evidence as to who

 was the source of the investigative report; to which Attorney Napolitano replied,

 “That’s correct.” Id. The Court went on to say that it was able to draw an inference

 from what was before it, that it had given Attorney Napolitano an opportunity to

 present evidence, but there was “no evidence other than what I have before me,”

 again, referring to the absence of any evidence of another possible culprit.        Id.

 (emphasis supplied).

       Mr. Leland badly misreads this colloquy. The Court had before it evidence that

 AUSA Perry had sent sensitive investigative information to Mr. Leland’s then

 attorney and that this information had turned up in Hampden, Maine at the home of

 a known drug dealer. Once Attorney Largay was eliminated as the sender of the

 information to Mr. Dunroe, the Court could easily infer that Mr. Leland, the

 presumed recipient of the information, was the sender.

       Against this inference, the Court told Attorney Napolitano that if Mr. Leland

 wanted the Court to draw a different conclusion, he was free to present any evidence

 that would tend to show that Mr. Leland was not the actual sender. But Mr. Leland

 declined to present any evidence on this issue at all. Mr. Leland himself did not deny

 being the sender at the sentencing hearing. He did not tell the Court that he did not

 know Thomas Dunroe. He did not tell the Court that others had access to his cell and

 may have sent out the discovery material. He did not call a prison official to describe



                                           44
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 45 of 76          PageID #: 1496



 access to cells or the prison’s mail system. He did not say (and has never said) who

 was the likely culprit. He did not attempt to call Mr. Dunroe or anyone else to clear

 up where Mr. Dunroe obtained those documents. At the sentencing hearing, the

 Court was left with only an attorney’s argument, unsupported by any evidence, that

 speculated that some unknown person, not his client, may have been the source of

 the investigative material. Given the logical inference that someone who received a

 package is the most likely person to have forwarded it and in the absence of any

 countervailing evidence, the Court maintained its finding that it was likely Mr.

 Leland was the source of the investigative information found in the Dunroe house.

       In short, the Court rejects Mr. Leland’s contention that during the sentencing

 hearing, the Court had confessed that it had no evidence of the source of the

 investigative reports.   To be precise, at the sentencing hearing, the Court had

 evidence that Mr. Leland was the likely source and had no evidence to the contrary.

              6.     The Court as Impartial Arbiter

       In both his petition and his motion for reconsideration, Mr. Leland accuses the

 Court of violating its obligation to act as an impartial arbiter. Def.’s Pet. at 11-12;

 Def.’s Mot. at 1-2. Mr. Leland explains that because “the parties both agreed that the

 Petitioner should not have received the Obstruction of Justice enhancement”, the

 Court violated the “Neutral Arbiter” rule by imposing an enhancement that the

 parties agreed should not apply. Def.’s Pet. at 11-12.

       Mr. Leland’s argument on this point reveals a fundamental misunderstanding

 about the Court’s, the parties’, and the PO’s roles at sentencing. The criminal rules



                                           45
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 46 of 76         PageID #: 1497



 provide for different types of plea agreements. By far the most commonly used in the

 District of Maine is found in Rule 11(c)(1)(B), where the parties have the right to

 make non-binding recommendations to the sentencing judge.          FED. R. CRIM. P.

 11(c)(1)(B) (“such a recommendation or request does not bind the court”). A second

 plea agreement that is exceedingly rare in the District of Maine is found in Rule

 11(c)(1)(C), where the parties make sentencing recommendations that bind the

 sentencing judge, if the judge accepts the plea agreement.         FED. R. CRIM. P.

 11(c)(1)(C). Mr. Leland entered into the first, non-binding type of plea agreement,

 not the second, binding type of agreement. Plea Agreement at 4 (“Pursuant to Fed.

 R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(B), the parties agree to take the following positions at

 sentencing”).

       The effect of Rule 11(c)(1)(B) is that the sentencing judge may accept or reject

 the parties’ sentencing recommendations and impose a more severe (or less severe)

 sentence than the one the parties recommend. Mr. Leland’s Plea Agreement makes

 it abundantly clear that the parties are making recommendations to the Court on

 sentencing and that their recommendations are not binding on the Court. Each of

 the sentencing positions on the Guidelines in the Plea Agreement starts with the

 phrase: “The parties agree to recommend that the Court find . . . .” Plea Agreement

 at 4-5.   But any doubt is removed by additional language in Mr. Leland’s Plea

 Agreement:

       The parties expressly agree and understand that these
       recommendations will not be binding on the Court and should the Court
       reject the recommendations of the parties, Defendant will not thereby
       be permitted to withdraw his/her guilty plea. The parties agree and

                                          46
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 47 of 76          PageID #: 1498



       understand that the Court has the discretion to impose any lawful
       sentence.

 Plea Agreement at 5.

       To make certain that a defendant understands that the Court retains the

 discretion to impose a harsher or more lenient sentence than the one recommended

 by the parties, at the Rule 11 the Court reviews this principle with counsel and the

 defendant. In Mr. Leland’s case, the Court engaged in the following colloquy with

 counsel:

       THE COURT: Does this plea agreement in any way inhibit my
       discretion in sentencing, Mr. Perry?

       MR. PERRY: It does not, Your Honor.

       THE COURT: Mr. Largay?

       MR. LARGAY: No, Your Honor.

 Rule 11 Tr. at 22:10-14. The Court also directly addressed Mr. Leland:

       THE COURT: Now, I also want you to turn, if you would Mr. Leland, to
       page 4 paragraph 3 of the agreement to plead guilty. Do you see that,
       sir?

       THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.

       THE COURT:           This contains a number of references to
       recommendations that the parties agree to make to the court concerning
       base offense levels and whether the evidence supports a finding of a
       dangerous weapon possessed in relation to the drug offense, increases
       in points, acceptance of responsibility, and other matters. Did you
       review that paragraph before coming to court today?

       THE DEFENDANT: Yes, I did.

       THE COURT: What I want you to understand Mr. Leland is this. That
       as far as sentencing is concerned, this plea agreement permits you and
       your lawyer, Mr. Largay, and the prosecutor to make recommendations

                                         47
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 48 of 76           PageID #: 1499



       to the court regarding sentencing, but the authority to determine the
       appropriate sentence in this case rests with me as the judge in this court.
       Do you understand, sir?

       THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.

       THE COURT: If I do not accept the recommendations, even those
       recommendations that are set forth in paragraph 3, you will have no
       right to withdraw your guilty plea. Do you understand?

       THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.

 Id. at 22:20-23:19.

       After the guilty plea, the PO performs an investigation and prepares a PSR,

 which makes recommendations to the Court regarding the Guideline calculations and

 its sentencing recommendations. FED. R. CRIM. P. 32(d). In making its Guideline and

 sentencing recommendations, the PO is not bound by the agreements of the parties,

 and the parties have a right to object to the PO’s recommendations. FED. R. CRIM. P.

 32(g). The Rule provides that if the sentencing judge is contemplating a possible

 departure from the sentencing range on a ground not identified by the PO or by the

 parties, the judge is required to inform the parties. FED. R. CRIM. P. 32(h). Although

 it does not happen that often, occasionally, as in this case, the PO will make a

 Guideline recommendation to the Court that differs from what the parties have

 recommended in a plea agreement, and the law contemplates that the Court may

 hear evidence and must rule on those and other disputes at the sentencing hearing.

 FED. R. CRIM. P. 32(i)(3).

       Here, the Court followed the exact procedure contemplated by the criminal

 rules. The PO performed its investigation and recommended that the Court impose



                                           48
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 49 of 76          PageID #: 1500



 a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, the parties were allowed to review

 the PSR and to object to the PO recommendation, the Court made certain that the

 parties were aware before the sentencing hearing that it was considering the

 obstruction of justice enhancement, the parties were given the opportunity to present

 evidence and to argue the proposed enhancement, and the Court ruled on the

 enhancement, setting forth in detail its factual and legal findings. There is nothing

 unusual about this general process and in following this procedure, the Court was not

 abrogating the right to determine the issues that required resolution.         It was

 complying with standard procedure, where the parties and the PO have the right to

 present issues for resolution to the Court. None of this should come as a surprise to

 Mr. Leland because this procedure is explicit in his Plea Agreement and was

 explained to him during the Rule 11 hearing. The Court rejects his contention that

 it violated the so-called neutral arbiter rule.

              7.     The Obstruction of Justice Enhancement

       The real source of Mr. Leland’s discontent is that he believes the Court unfairly

 found that he obstructed justice. The Court has repeatedly endeavored to explain to

 Mr. Leland why it reached this conclusion but without success. It will try again.

       There was no indication in either Mr. Leland’s January 27, 2004 Plea

 Agreement or at his January 27, 2004 Rule 11 that he might be subject to a two-level

 enhancement for obstruction of justice. The Plea Agreement makes no mention of it.

 Plea Agreement at 1-8. It did not come up during his Rule 11. Rule 11 Tr. at 1-29.




                                            49
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 50 of 76          PageID #: 1501



 This is because the conduct that undergirded the obstruction of justice enhancement

 had either not occurred or not been discovered.

        To the Court’s knowledge, the first mention of a possible obstruction of justice

 enhancement appeared in the PSR at paragraph 60:

        In March 2004, following his guilty plea, defendant Leland wrote a letter
        to members of the Hell’s Angels noting his desire to cause bodily injury
        to codefendant, Robert Stewart, as Stewart provided incriminating
        information to authorities regarding Leland. Therefore, the defendant,
        directly or indirectly, attempted to threaten, intimidate or otherwise
        unlawfully influence a codefendant or witness. Further, in March 2004,
        defendant Leland disseminated discovery material to others, including
        prison inmates, known felons in the community and other Hell’s Angels.

 PSR ¶ 60. The PSR isolates two instances of potential obstruction: the March 2004

 Leland letter and the dissemination of discovery. Id. These were the issues that the

 Court raised to the parties at the Presentence Conference on October 24, 2005.

 Presentence Conf. Tr. at 5:25-9:3.

                      a.   Robert Stewart

        At the sentencing hearing, the Government introduced the letter that Mr.

 Leland wrote to David in March 2004 and two investigation reports that Mr. Leland

 attached to that letter. As noted earlier, the letter was in Mr. Leland’s handwriting

 to a man named “David” discussing Robert Stewart, a codefendant and witness

 against Mr. Leland. Sentencing Hr’g at 62-63. Referring to Mr. Stewart, Mr. Leland’s

 letter stated in part:

        Sending some paperwork that you and others in your area will be
        interested in . . . That bastard has been a rat since 2000. He told a lot
        of lies about me.

 Id. at 62. Mr. Leland then referred to a man named Alan McDougal and said:

                                           50
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 51 of 76         PageID #: 1502



       Both of them have been rats for a long time . . . The club didn’t support
       me through this because of them, and now the club knows the difference.
       I hope they come around. Well, David, I always liked you a lot and
       wanted you to know what he was. I pray I meet him in here someday.
       He thinks he’s tough. I’ll show the asshole what tough is. You take care
       of yourself.

 Id. Mr. Leland signed the letter “Your real friend, Bill Leland, Hells Angels.” Id. at

 62-63. Mr. Leland attached seven pages of investigative reports that detailed Mr.

 Stewart’s involvement in the greater conspiracy.      Id. at 63.   At the end of the

 investigative report, Mr. Leland wrote:

       Look at that. The asshole gave up his in-laws. What a nice guy.

 Id.

       To place this letter in perspective, Robert Stewart was a codefendant in this

 case. Second Superseding Indictment (ECF No. 60). On September 24, 2003, a grand

 jury indicted Mr. Stewart for conspiring with Mr. Leland to distribute cocaine, id.at

 2 (Count Three), and multiple other drug trafficking counts. Id. at 3-6. On January

 6, 2004 and again on January 22, 2004, the Government filed prosecution versions on

 Mr. Stewart’s case, both of which among other things confirmed that Mr. Stewart had

 been supplying Mr. Leland with cocaine. Gov’t’s Version of the Offense at 1 (ECF No.

 143) (ECF No. 193). On January 23, 2004, the Government filed an Agreement to

 Plead Guilty and Cooperate executed by Mr. Stewart in which Mr. Stewart agreed to

 testify about his involvement and the involvement of others in the violations of law

 set forth in the indictment, Agreement to Plead Guilty and Cooperate (ECF No. 200),

 and on the same day, Mr. Stewart pleaded guilty to five drug trafficking counts in the

 superseding indictment. Minute Entry (ECF No. 203).

       Jury selection had been scheduled for the case against Mr. Leland for January

 29, 2004. Notice of Hr’g (ECF No. 198). In the Government’s trial brief, it stated:

       The evidence also is expected to show that in approximately January
       2003, Leland began obtaining cocaine from Robert Stewart for
       distribution.    Stewart supplied cocaine to Leland on numerous
       occasions. After one occasion, Leland ruined the cocaine while trying to
       process it. In an attempt to get out of paying for this cocaine, Leland
       devised a story that he lost the cocaine. As a result of his drug dealings
       with Stewart, Leland amassed a debt of approximately $16,000.

 Gov’t’s Trial Br. at 5-6 (ECF No. 186). Mr. Leland pleaded guilty on January 27,

 2004, four days after Mr. Stewart had pleaded guilty and two days before jury

 selection. Minute Entry (ECF No. 205). Mr. Leland admitted a prosecution version,

 which stated in part:

       The testimony and evidence also would show, in substance, that at least
       from January 2003 through March 2003, this defendant was obtaining
       cocaine from [a] third individual and directly and indirectly distributing
       the cocaine in Maine.

 Gov’t’s Version of the Offense at 1 (ECF No. 206). The PSR later details Mr. Stewart’s

 involvement in Mr. Leland’s drug dealing conspiracy. PSR at 15. The upshot is that

 Mr. Stewart was a significant potential witness against Mr. Leland: Mr. Stewart had

 sold Mr. Leland cocaine, Mr. Leland owed him either $15,000, id., or $16,000 for

 cocaine, Gov’t’s Trial Br. at 5-6, Mr. Stewart had pleaded guilty to multiple drug

 trafficking counts, including one that alleged he was involved in a drug trafficking

 conspiracy with Mr. Leland, and Mr. Stewart was prepared to testify against Mr.

 Leland in the upcoming trial. Although Mr. Stewart was not the only reason Mr.

 Leland decided to plead guilty, his anticipated testimony against Mr. Leland would

 have been compelling evidence and must have contributed to Mr. Leland’s decision to

                                          52
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 53 of 76          PageID #: 1504



 plead guilty. Mr. Leland had every reason to be upset with Mr. Stewart and as Mr.

 Leland’s March 2004 letter establishes, he was.

       During the sentencing hearing, the Court reviewed the obstruction of justice

 provision of the Guidelines:

       If (1) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded or attempted to
       obstruct of impede the administration of justice during the course of the
       investigation, prosecution or sentencing of the instant offense of
       conviction, and (2) the obstructive conduct related to (A) the defendant’s
       offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (B) a closely related
       offense, increase the offense level by 2 levels.

 See Sentencing Tr. at 61 (quoting USSG § 3C1.1).           The Court turned to the

 commentary to § 3C1.1 and observed that the United States Sentencing Commission

 lists the following examples of obstruction of justice:

       [T]hreatening, intimidating, or otherwise unlawfully influencing a co-
       defendant, witness or juror, directly or indirectly, or attempting to do
       so[.]

 USSG § 3C1.1, n.4(A). The Court reviewed the decisions of other courts and noted

 that in 1997, the First Circuit held in United States v. McMinn, 103 F.3d 216 (1st Cir.

 1997) that threatening letters to a prospective witness constituted obstruction of

 justice. Sentencing Tr. at 64. The Court also cited United States v. Bush, a Third

 Circuit case, for the same conclusion, where a defendant threatened a prosecutor and

 another person. Id.

       At the sentencing hearing, the Court concluded that Mr. Leland’s letter

 constituted a threat against Mr. Stewart, who had been a potential witness against

 him. Id. at 64-65. The Court noted that the threat was of particular concern because

 Mr. Leland later filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea and, if that motion had

                                            53
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 54 of 76         PageID #: 1505



 been successful, the Government would likely have called Mr. Stewart as a witness.

 Id. at 65. As the Court has previously explained, based on the threat alone, the Court

 did and would have imposed the obstruction of justice enhancement in Mr. Leland’s

 case. See Order Denying Mot. for Relief from Final J. under Rule 60(b)/(d) at 2-5

 (ECF No. 371).

         In his petition, Mr. Leland lists five reasons that the Court erred when it

 imposed the two-level obstruction of justice enhancement for the Stewart letter: (1)

 the sentencing judge “claims Petitioner sent a letter to a Hells Angel threatening

 Robert Stewart”; (2) Mr. Leland wrote the letter to David, a friend of his, because

 David had been told that Robert Stewart was going to harm Mr. Leland and Mr.

 Leland had “gotten a beating while a federal detainee at the Maine State Prison

 because Robert Stewart told people that Petitioner was a rat”; (3) Mr. Leland “knew

 Stewart was in federal prison in Raybrook, NY and could have gotten word to inmates

 at that prison that Stewart co-operated with the government and told on many

 people”, but Mr. Leland “never told anyone and Stewart did his time and was

 released”; and (4) three people visited Mr. Stewart on December 17, 2011 and Mr.

 Stewart assured them that he had never been threatened by Mr. Leland; and (5) Mr.

 Leland “never threatened Robert Stewart or told anyone else to hurt him”. Def.’s Pet.

 at 7.

         Regarding the first issue—that the sentencing judge wrongfully assumed that

 David was a member of the Hells Angels, the Court earlier addressed this contention

 and it is simply incorrect. What actually happened is that the Court asked counsel



                                          54
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 55 of 76            PageID #: 1506



 whether it could “infer that David in the letter . . . is a member of the Hell’s Angels.”

 Sentencing Tr. at 60. In response, AUSA Perry and Attorney Napolitano informed

 the Court that “David” was not a member of the Hells Angels and that the Court

 should not draw that inference from the Leland letter. Id. at 60-61. The Court agreed

 not to do so. Id. at 61 (“All right. So I can’t make that inference”).

       Regarding the second issue—that Mr. Stewart had threatened Mr. Leland and

 that Mr. Leland had been beaten in Maine State Prison because Mr. Stewart had

 falsely told other people that Mr. Leland had cooperated with the Government, this

 explanation only serves to further illuminate why Mr. Leland was angry with Mr.

 Stewart and why Mr. Leland threatened him. Mr. Leland’s effort to excuse his threat

 is unavailing.

       Regarding the third issue—that Mr. Leland knew where Mr. Stewart was

 incarcerated and could have but did not cause him harm while Mr. Stewart was in

 jail, this has nothing to do with the imposition of the obstruction of justice

 enhancement at the time of Mr. Leland’s sentencing. Although the Court is pleased

 that Mr. Leland did not later actually beat Mr. Stewart or order his beating, the

 obstruction of justice enhancement is applicable to a threat against a witness. The

 fact the threat was never carried out does not diminish its potential impact or negate

 the application of the enhancement. USSG § 3C1.1, n. 4(A) (“threatening . . . a co-

 defendant, witness . . . or attempting to do so”).

       The same logic applies to the fourth issue—the three witness affidavits that

 Mr. Leland attached to his petition. Again, the Court is pleased that Mr. Leland



                                            55
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 56 of 76          PageID #: 1507



 never actually beat Mr. Stewart and Mr. Stewart was never aware that Mr. Leland

 had made the threat. But the issue is not whether the threat was effective; the issue

 was whether the threat was made, and it was. United States v. Trinidad-Acosta, 773

 F.3d 298, 317-20 (1st Cir. 2014) (rejecting argument that a threat against a potential

 witness to a third party is not obstruction of justice).

       Finally, the Court rejects Mr. Leland’s assertion that he “never threatened

 Robert Stewart or told anyone else to hurt him.” Def.’s Pet. at 7. In the March 2004

 letter to David, Mr. Leland calls Mr. Stewart a “rat” and a “bastard”. He accuses Mr.

 Stewart of telling “a lot of lies about me.” He encloses investigative information that

 confirms that Mr. Stewart cooperated with the Government. He ends by saying: “I

 pray I meet him in here someday. He thinks he’s tough. I’ll show the asshole what

 tough is.” No matter what Mr. Leland now says, that is a threat. Also, sending

 investigative information about a cooperating codefendant to a third party confirms

 the witness’s cooperation and invites retribution.

       Mr. Leland has never really explained why he wrote this letter to David, a

 person Mr. Leland describes as a friend. To this day, (other than knowing who David

 is not—namely, he is not a Hells Angel), the Court does not even know who David is,

 what David’s last name is, where David lives, and what, if any, relationship he has

 had to this case. Nearly ten years after his sentencing, Mr. Leland makes the belated

 assertion that the reason he wrote the letter to David and enclosed investigative

 information about Robert Stewart was that Mr. Stewart had falsely claimed that Mr.

 Leland was a cooperator and, as a result, Mr. Leland had received a jailhouse beating



                                            56
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 57 of 76           PageID #: 1508



 due to Mr. Stewart’s false accusation. Why it was necessary to tell David, who

 presumably was not in jail, that Mr. Stewart was a rat, a liar and a bastard, to provide

 documentary evidence to David confirming that Mr. Stewart had cooperated with the

 Government, and to assure David that if Mr. Leland met Mr. Stewart in prison, he

 would assault Mr. Stewart remains a mystery to this day. But none of this changes

 the plain fact that Mr. Leland threatened Mr. Stewart in his March 2004 letter and

 thus merited an obstruction of justice enhancement on that basis alone.

       The Court’s conclusion is consistent with other cases where courts have held

 that if a defendant threatens a witness, the defendant merits an obstruction of justice

 enhancement. See Trinidad-Acosta, 773 F.3d at 317-20 (affirming obstruction of

 justice enhancement for threat against prospective government witness); United

 States v. McMinn, 103 F.3d 216, 218-19 (1st Cir. 1997) (affirming obstruction of

 justice enhancement for letters threatening a prospective government witness);

 United States v. Lagasse, 87 F.3d 18, 23-24 (1st Cir. 1996) (affirming obstruction of

 justice enhancement where defendant called a witness a “rat” and assaulted him in

 prison); United States v. Sabatino, 943 F.2d 94, 100-02 (1st Cir. 1991) (affirming

 obstruction of justice enhancement where defendant said that a witness would “end

 up taking a one-way walk through the woods” and another witness would “get his”);

 United States v. Belskis, 477 F. Supp. 2d 237, 245-46 (D. Me. 2007) (imposing

 obstruction of justice enhancement where defendant accused a witness of being a

 DEA agent and said “You are all going to fucking get it”).

                     b.     Thomas Dunroe



                                           57
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 58 of 76                      PageID #: 1509



        For some time, Mr. Leland has been obsessed with the Thomas Dunroe

 incident where investigative reports that AUSA Perry sent to Attorney Largay, Mr.

 Leland’s then lawyer, were found in Thomas Dunroe’s Hampden home.8 This Court

 has explained to Mr. Leland on more than one occasion that his written threat against

 Robert Stewart was enough by itself to impose the obstruction of justice

 enhancement. Even if Mr. Leland were able to convince the Court that he had

 nothing to do with Mr. Dunroe’s possession of the investigative reports, it would not

 matter. The threat against Mr. Stewart was and is enough:

        Regarding the second point, however, Mr. Leland tenaciously holds to
        the belief that the reason he received an enhancement for obstruction of
        justice and denial of acceptance was solely because of the discovery
        documents that law enforcement found in the Hampden, Maine home of
        Thomas Dunroe. Mr. Leland has presented an affidavit from Thomas
        A. Dunroe stating that he does not know Mr. Leland, has never talked
        to him, never corresponded with him, never received anything in the
        mail from him, and does not know what he looks like. Def.’s Mot., Aff.
        of Thomas Dunroe Attach. 1. With this evidence, which is consistent
        with his earlier factual representations, Mr. Leland seeks
        reconsideration of the Court’s sentencing decision to impose a two-level
        increase for obstruction of justice and to deny a three-level reduction for
        acceptance of responsibility.

        So that it is clear. The Court did not impose the two-level enhancement
        under U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1 primarily because of the information found in
        Mr. Dunroe’s Hampden home. At the October 27, 2005 sentencing, the
        Government introduced into evidence a letter written in Mr. Leland’s
        hand to a man named “David.” Tr. of Sentencing Hearing at 59 (Docket
        # 339). In the letter dated March 2004, Mr. Leland states that he is
        enclosing some “paperwork that you and others in your area will be
        interested in.” Id. at 62. He refers specifically to Robert Stewart and
        says that “[t]hat bastard has been a rat since 2000. He told a lot of lies


 8       In his motion for reconsideration, Mr. Leland asserts that he “submitted caselaw that states
 that informing someone that they are under investigation is not Obstruction of Justice.” Pet’r’s Mot.
 for Recons. at 2. The Court scrutinized Mr. Leland’s petition and could find no such cited authority
 and doubts that it exists.

                                                  58
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 59 of 76          PageID #: 1510



       about me.” Id. He also mentions an Alan McDougal and writes that
       “[b]oth of them have been rats for a long time.” Id. He writes:

       The club didn’t support me through this because of them, and now the
       club knows the difference. I hope they come around. Well, David, I
       always liked you a lot and wanted you to know what he was. I pray I
       meet him in here someday. He thinks he’s tough. I’ll show the asshole
       what tough is.

       Id. It was signed: “Your real friend, Bill Leland, Hells Angels.” Id.

       Attached to the March 2004 letter was a report of an investigation that
       detailed in a total of seven pages, Mr. Stewart’s role in the drug
       distribution conspiracy. Id. at 63. At the end of the report, a comment
       appears in Mr. Leland’s handwriting: “Look at that. The asshole gave
       up his in-laws. What a nice guy.” Id.

       The Court found that Mr. Leland’s March 2004 letter to “David”
       amounted to a threat against Robert Stewart. Id. at 64-65. On
       September 26, 2003, a federal grand jury charged that Robert Stewart
       had conspired with Mr. Leland to engage in a drug dealing conspiracy.
       Second Superseding Indictment at 2-3 (Docket # 60). On January 21,
       2004, as trial approached for Mr. Leland, the Government revealed that
       its case against Mr. Leland included evidence that Mr. Stewart supplied
       cocaine to Mr. Leland for distribution. Gov’t’s Trial Br. at 5-6 (Docket #
       186). On January 23, 2004, Mr. Stewart pleaded guilty. Minute Entry
       (Docket # 203). With trial scheduled to start on January 29, 2004, Mr.
       Leland pleaded guilty to seven counts in the Second Superseding
       Indictment on January 27, 2004. Minute Entry (Docket # 205).

       Comment four to U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1, the obstruction of justice
       enhancement, expressly states that the provision applies to
       “threatening, intimidating or otherwise unlawfully influencing a co-
       defendant [or] witness,… directly or indirectly, or attempting to do so.”
       U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1 Comment 4(a). The First Circuit has observed that
       “threatening letters” sent to “a prospective government witness” can
       constitute obstruction of justice within the meaning of § 3C1.1. United
       States v. McMinn, 103 F.3d 216, 218-19 (1st Cir. 1997). It has upheld
       an obstruction of justice enhancement when a defendant characterized
       another prisoner -- just as Mr. Leland characterized Mr. Stewart -- as a
       “rat,” United States v. Lagasse, 87 F.3d 18, 23-24 (1st Cir. 1996), and
       when a defendant told a witness she would “end up taking a one-way
       walk through the woods.” United States v. Sabatino, 943 F.2d 94, 100-
       01 (1st Cir. 1991). This Court has applied the same enhancement in

                                          59
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 60 of 76            PageID #: 1511



       similar situations. See United States v. Belskis, 477 F. Supp. 2d 237,
       246-47 (D. Me. 2007).

       The Court considered Mr. Leland’s threatening letter to Mr. Stewart to
       be particularly egregious because it contained both a direct and indirect
       threat against a central witness and co-defendant. Mr. Leland’s later
       motion to withdraw his guilty plea increased the risk that if the motion
       had been successful and the threat had been carried out or even
       communicated to Mr. Stewart, the Government could have been
       deprived of Mr. Stewart’s testimony at a later trial. Mr. Leland’s direct
       threat against Mr. Stewart and his decision to let “David” and people “in
       [his] area” know about Mr. Stewart, Sentencing Tr. at 62, compelled the
       application of § 3C1.1. The Court’s imposition of an obstruction of justice
       enhancement also resulted in its decision to deny a three-level reduction
       for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1. See U.S.S.G.
       3E1.1, Comment 4 (stating that “[c]onduct resulting in an enhancement
       under § 3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice)
       ordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility
       for his criminal conduct”).

       Mr. Leland’s threat to Mr. Stewart in his own handwriting was the
       primary basis for the obstruction of justice enhancement and the denial
       of acceptance of responsibility. Mr. Leland’s other actions, including the
       Dunroe papers, were cumulative. Thus, even if the Court concluded that
       Mr. Leland is correct that he had nothing to do with appearance of the
       papers in Mr. Dunroe’s house, the sentencing result for Mr. Leland
       would be unchanged.

       This is the last time the Court will explain this in writing. It is done all
       it can do to set the record straight; yet, Mr. Leland keeps filing the same
       motion, earnestly repeating his contention about the Dunroe papers.
       The Court remains convinced that Mr. Leland knows full well that he
       was very angry with Mr. Stewart and that he threatened to harm him.
       Mr. Leland must also know that his threat was distinctly unwise
       because consistent with the Sentencing Guidelines and First Circuit
       authority, the Court did what it would do in any other similar case: it
       imposed a higher sentence against Mr. Leland. The law simply does not
       allow defendants who are awaiting sentence to write out threats against
       central witnesses and the law extracts an additional punishment
       against those who do so. Once again, the Court remains encouraged by
       Mr. Leland’s assurances that he has changed his ways and now stands
       ready to live a productive and law-abiding life. However, as the Court
       wrote earlier, his rehabilitation will have to be its own reward.



                                           60
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 61 of 76           PageID #: 1512



         In short, for the last time, the Court cannot grant Mr. Leland’s repeated
         motions because it does not have the authority to change his sentence
         and because if it could, it would not.

 Order Denying Mot. for Relief from Final J. Under Rule 60(b)/(d) at 2-6 (ECF No.

 371).

         Furthermore, at the sentencing hearing, the evidence demonstrated that the

 investigative material in Mr. Dunroe’s house had been forwarded by AUSA Perry to

 Mr. Leland’s then attorney, Christopher Largay. The Court assumed without dispute

 that Attorney Largay had not spread this confidential material around the Bangor

 area. Instead, it was logical that Attorney Largay sent this investigative material to

 Mr. Leland and, once in Mr. Leland’s possession, the investigative material had found

 its way to Mr. Dunroe’s Hampden, Maine residence. Once the Court reached the

 conclusion that the material was likely the same material that Attorney Largay had

 sent Mr. Leland, the Court inferred that Mr. Leland was responsible for its

 safekeeping. There were at least four possibilities: (1) that Mr. Leland deliberately

 sent the material to Mr. Dunroe, (2) that Mr. Leland deliberately sent the material

 to someone who then shared it with Mr. Dunroe, (3) that Mr. Leland deliberately

 allowed someone in the jail to take the material and disperse it, or (4) that someone

 in the jail stole the material from Mr. Leland without his knowledge or consent and

 sent it to Mr. Dunroe or someone else, who then sent it to Mr. Dunroe.

         Mr. Leland has repeatedly pointed to a February 9, 2009 affidavit signed by

 Thomas Dunroe that Mr. Leland claims exonerates him from being the source of the

 dissemination of the investigative material. The Dunroe affidavit states (1) that Mr.



                                            61
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 62 of 76                  PageID #: 1513



 Dunroe does not know Mr. Leland, and (2) that Mr. Leland did not mail him anything,

 including the investigative material. Pet’r’s Mot. Attach. 3 Aff. of Thomas Dunroe at

 1-2.9 Even if accepted, Mr. Dunroe’s affidavit eliminates only the possibility that Mr.

 Leland directly sent the material to Mr. Dunroe. The other alternatives remain

 viable: (1) that Mr. Leland deliberately sent the material indirectly to Mr. Dunroe,

 (2) that Mr. Leland deliberately sent material to someone other than Mr. Dunroe and

 that it ended up with Mr. Dunroe, (3) that Mr. Leland allowed someone to take the

 material and that person sent the material to Mr. Dunroe or to a third party, or (4)

 that someone took the material from Mr. Leland’s cell without his consent and sent

 it to Mr. Dunroe or to a third party who sent it to Mr. Dunroe.10 Mr. Dunroe never

 mentions in his affidavit where he got the material.

        At the sentencing hearing, Mr. Leland elected to remain silent on this issue.

 He did not address the Dunroe material during his allocution and he presented no

 evidence at all on the issue, no witnesses, no documents indicating that he had

 complained of the theft to prison authorities, nothing. The Court had evidence from

 Mr. Leland’s letter to “David” that Mr. Leland was disseminating investigative

 material to third parties and from Mr. Leland’s letter to his son Derek that he was

 sending "stuff“ about Omar and Don Grace to someone at Maine State Prison in

 violation of prison policy. Therefore, his dissemination of investigative material




 9      As noted earlier, there are oddities about the two Dunroe affidavits that give the Court
 considerable pause. See supra note1.
 10     In a motion filed on September 24, 2008, Mr. Leland implied that a man named Lance Palmer
 sent the investigative material to Mr. Dunroe. Def. William Leland’s Pro Se Mot. for Sentence
 Reduction at 5 (ECF No. 350). He does not reassert this claim in the pending petition.

                                               62
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 63 of 76        PageID #: 1514



 would be consistent with his other documented actions. Long after the sentencing

 hearing, Mr. Leland has strenuously claimed that he had nothing to do with the

 dissemination of the material. Mr. Leland’s protestations of innocence regarding his

 role in the dissemination of the material that was found in the Dunroe house have

 come far too late, have not convinced the Court that he had nothing to do with the

 dissemination and, in any event, as the Court has written and re-written, it does not

 matter. The Dunroe evidence was cumulative. Mr. Leland sealed the applicability

 of the obstruction of justice enhancement when he sealed the letter to David

 threatening Mr. Stewart.

                    c.      Omar and Don Grace

       The third incident upon which the Court relied in assessing an obstruction of

 justice enhancement on Mr. Leland involved two codefendants, Omar and Don Grace.

 This was new information that was not discussed during the presentence conference,

 but the Government introduced the information at the sentencing hearing without

 objection from Mr. Leland.

       Mr. and Ms. Grace were a married couple; each was involved in the Leland

 drug trafficking conspiracy, Ms. Grace much more than Mr. Grace. See United States

 v. Donald Grace, Docket No. 1:02-cr-00017-JAW (D. Me.). They were charged by

 criminal complaint on November 16, 2001 before Mr. Leland was charged by criminal

 complaint on April 7, 2003. Ms. Grace pleaded guilty on October 7, 2002 and was

 sentenced on January 8, 2003 to 130 months. J. (ECF No. 48-1:02-cr-00017-JAW).




                                          63
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 64 of 76        PageID #: 1515



 Mr. Grace pleaded guilty on July 9, 2003 and was sentenced on March 30, 2004 to

 twenty-eight months. J. (ECF No. 100-1:02-cr-00017-JAW).

       At Mr. Leland’s sentencing hearing, the Government introduced a letter dated

 April 26, 2004 from Mr. Leland to his son Derek Leland, thanking him for

 “photocopying all that stuff on Omar and Donny Grace.” Sentencing Tr. at 63. Mr.

 Leland commented that “[i]t is going to help a lot.” Id. Mr. Leland did not say what

 the “stuff” was. Mr. Leland asked his son Derek to send the information to an

 attorney, marked “Legal correspondence,” in the lower right-hand corner, and to mail

 it to Walter Cobb at the Maine State Prison, where Mr. Leland himself was housed

 at the time. Id. According to John Shedd, a correctional investigator, Mr. Leland’s

 request to his son to copy and forward material as legal correspondence violated the

 prison’s mail policy. Id.

       At the sentencing, the Court did not separately discuss Mr. Leland’s letter to

 Derek Leland, except to note that the Government had moved it into evidence. As

 the Court noted earlier, Mr. Leland’s letter to Derek Leland enclosing “stuff” about

 Mr. and Ms. Grace again confirms his willingness to distribute material to third

 parties on other members of his conspiracy.

                     d.      Conclusion: Obstruction of Justice Enhancement

       For reasons this Court has explained to Mr. Leland in detail, the Court

 imposed the obstruction of justice enhancement against him at the sentencing

 hearing because the evidence demonstrated that his conduct merited the

 enhancement.



                                         64

              8.     Acceptance of Responsibility

       Mr. Leland demands that the Court “give him the three (3) point reduction he

 was promised for his guilty plea.” Pet’r’s Mot. at 7. He also claims that the three-

 level reduction was “agreed upon in the oral plea agreement.” Id. at 11. Here, he is

 presumably referring to the three-level reduction under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1. The Court

 has already discussed its conclusions that it has accepted Mr. Leland’s Rule 11

 assurance that no such oral plea agreement existed.

       Turning to the terms of the written plea agreement, paragraph 3(D) provided:

       The Government agrees to recommend that the Court find that the
       Defendant has accepted responsibility for the offenses of conviction in
       the above-captioned Indictment, and that the Court should reduce by 3
       levels Defendant’s Adjusted Offense Level under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1.

       The Government reserves the right not to recommend a reduction under
       U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1 if, at any time between his/her execution of this
       Agreement and sentencing Defendant (a) fails to admit a complete
       factual basis for the plea; (2) fails to truthfully admit his/her conduct in
       the offenses of conviction; and (c) falsely denies or frivolously contests
       relevant conduct for which Defendant is accountable under U.S.S.G. §
       1B1.3.

 Plea Agreement at 4.

       In light of this provision, unlike the obstruction of justice enhancement, AUSA

 Perry took the position the Government was able to argue under the terms of the plea

 agreement whether the Court should accord Mr. Leland a three-level reduction for

 acceptance of responsibility. Sentencing Tr. at 69-70. AUSA Perry argued against

 the three-level reduction for acceptance because after Mr. Leland entered his guilty

 plea, he continued to assert his innocence, because he had written the Court and

 attempted to deflect his criminal responsibility to the prosecutor, to his ex-wife, and

                                           65
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 66 of 76          PageID #: 1517



 to “just about everybody but himself”, and because he obstructed justice. Id. at 70-

 72. Attorney Napolitano did not separately argue the applicability of the acceptance

 of responsibility reduction. Id. at 73 (“THE COURT: Would you like to be heard on

 [acceptance], Mr. Napolitano? MR. NAPOLITANO: No, your Honor, you have the

 facts.”).

        After reciting the language of U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1, the Court observed that if Mr.

 Leland had simply remained silent after he had entered his plea, the Court would

 have granted him acceptance. Id. at 74. But Mr. Leland had not remained silent.

 Instead, he had engaged in a “sort of campaign” by writing letters, including letters

 to the Court. Id. The problem was that “in some of the letters he wrote to me and

 some of the letters he wrote elsewhere, and what he did in court, he essentially denied

 what he admitted to at the time of his earlier plea.” Id. at 74-75. The Court noted

 that contrary to the terms of his plea agreement, he wrote on March 11, 2004 that

 “I’m saying that I wasn’t the leader or organizer of anything.” Id. at 75 (quoting

 Gov’t’s Ex. 18). He wrote that he knew of “only a little over 200 grams of meth and

 he implies that perhaps his ex-wife [Genessa], planted it.” Id.

        One factor a court must examine in determining whether to grant a motion to

 withdraw a guilty plea is whether the defendant is claiming he is actually innocent

 of the crimes to which he pleaded guilty. See Order on Def.’s Mot. to Withdraw Guilty

 Plea at 5, 12-13 (citing United States v. Padilla-Galarza, 351 F.3d 594, 597 (1st Cir.

 2003); United States v. Gonzalez, 202 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 2000); United States v.

 Richardson, 225 F.3d 46, 51 (1st Cir. 2000)) (ECF No. 291). Accordingly, at Mr.



                                           66
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 67 of 76         PageID #: 1518



 Leland’s sentencing the Court returned to what Mr. Leland had maintained when he

 filed his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Sentencing Tr. at 73-78. The Court noted

 that at the oral argument on the motion to withdraw the guilty plea, the Court asked

 Attorney Largay whether Mr. Leland was saying that he was actually innocent of the

 charges or was just maintaining that the Government could not prove them. Id. at

 75-76. After consulting with Mr. Leland, Attorney Largay stated: “Well, I conferred

 with him a moment ago, your Honor. He maintains innocence with respect to more

 than just that one crime. That’s what I was thinking previously.” Id. at 76 (quoting

 Oral Argument on Mot. to Withdraw Guilty Plea 30:24-31:2 (ECF No. 290) (Tr.

 Withdrawal of Plea Mot.)). The Court closely questioned Mr. Largay as to whether

 Mr. Leland “saying someone else did it, ‘I’m innocent,’ is that right?” Id. at 77

 (quoting Tr. Withdrawal of Plea Mot. at 33:14-19). Mr. Largay responded, “That is

 what he is maintaining, Your Honor.” Tr. Withdrawal of Plea Mot. at 33:20-21. The

 Court pressed Attorney Largay whether Mr. Leland was even claiming actual

 innocence on the firearm charge and Mr. Largay responded that he was. Id. at 33:22-

 24.

       Last, the Court turned to a letter Mr. Leland had authored entitled, “The Fall

 of an Angel” in which Mr. Leland elaborated why he contended that other people were

 responsible for the crimes to which he had pleaded guilty. Sentencing Tr. at 77. The

 Court agreed with AUSA Perry that “in that eight-page letter, he blame[d] . . .

 virtually everybody but himself.” Id.




                                          67
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 68 of 76            PageID #: 1519



       Based on this cumulative evidence, the Court concluded at the sentencing

 hearing that “it is abundantly clear, absolutely clear, without any wiggle room here

 that he is not entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility because he

 doesn’t accept responsibility.” Id. at 78.

       In his pending motion, Mr. Leland has provided the Court with no reason to

 revisit its finding at the time of sentencing that he had not accepted responsibility for

 the offenses of conviction as required under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1 for a three-level

 reduction. Mr. Leland’s only current charge is that the Court and the Government

 violated the terms of his plea agreement in failing to accord him the three-level

 reduction, but in fact, Mr. Leland himself violated the terms of the plea agreement

 by attempting to withdraw his plea and repeatedly asserting that he was not guilty

 of the crimes to which he had pleaded guilty.         As the Court stated during the

 sentencing hearing, Mr. Leland is “not entitled to a reduction for acceptance of

 responsibility because he doesn’t accept responsibility.” Id. at 78; see U.S.S.G. §

 3E1.1, n. 1(A) (In determining whether a defendant qualifies under subsection (a),

 appropriate considerations include, but are not limited to the following: (A) truthfully

 admitting the conduct comprising the offense(s) of conviction . . . .”).

              9.     Ineffective Assistance of Counsel

       Mr. Leland now says that Attorney Robert Napolitano was ineffective in

 representing him at his sentencing. Def.’s Pet. at 10-11; Def.’s Mot. at 2. However

 Mr. Leland wishes to characterize it, this motion “is in substance an application for

 leave to file a second or successive application under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.” J. at 1 (ECF



                                              68
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 69 of 76           PageID #: 1520



 No. 391); see Trenkler, 536 F.3d at 97 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Melton v. United States,

 359 F.3d 855, 857 (7th Cir. 2004)) (“Any motion filed in the district court that imposed

 the sentence, and substantively within the scope of § 2255 ¶ 1, is a motion under §

 2255, no matter what title the prisoner plasters on the cover”) (emphasis in original).

 His attempt to charge Attorney Napolitano, as opposed to his earlier counsel Attorney

 Largay, with ineffective assistance of counsel is barred because it is too late, because

 it is a second or successive petition on a sentencing issue, and because he is in the

 wrong court; that is, he has not obtained the First Circuit’s prior permission to file

 the petition. 18 U.S.C. § 2255(f), (h); 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(3)(A) (a petitioner must

 obtain advance approval of the appellate court before proceeding with a successive §

 2255 petition).

              10.    Disparate Sentences

        In his petition, Mr. Leland argues that his sentence of 252 months was

 disparate from other similarly-situated codefendants. Def.’s Pet. at 16-17. Mr. Leland

 does not specifically mention any codefendants, what their sentences were, and why

 his sentence was unlawfully disparate. Id. Mr. Leland’s argument is too undeveloped

 to state a legal contention. Specifically, Mr. Leland points to no other defendant who

 carried his set of enhancements, resulting in a Guideline sentence of 235 to 293

 months.

 III.   MOTION TO EXPUNGE CONVICTION

        A.    The Motion




                                           69
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 70 of 76          PageID #: 1521



       By letter motion dated February 23, 2015, Mr. Leland asked the Court to

 expunge his conviction on the felon in possession charge. Def.’s Mot. to Expunge

 Conviction (ECF No. 411). Mr. Leland explained that under Bureau of Prisons (BOP)

 rules, he is not entitled to receive a twelve-month reduction in sentence because of

 the firearms conviction but that his case manager told him that if the Court expunged

 the conviction, he could receive the twelve-month credit under BOP rules. Id. at 1-2.

 Mr. Leland asserts that at the sentencing hearing or the Rule 11 colloquy, he

 informed the Court that he was not guilty of some of the charges but that he pleaded

 guilty to save his son. Id. at 1. He argues that his firearms conviction was based on

 a receipt and he objects to the use of a receipt to establish possession. Id. To his

 motion, Mr. Leland attached another letter addressed to this Judge, which goes into

 detail about his view that his sentence was improperly enhanced, that he never

 obstructed justice, that he was not a leader or manager, that he never possessed some

 of the drugs as charged, and that his drug quantity was improperly enhanced by ghost

 drugs. Id. Attach. 1 Letter from William Leland to Judge Woodcock at 1-6 (Feb. 18,

 2015). Mr. Leland also attached a BOP denial of his request for a § 3621(e) offense

 review. Id. Attach. 2 Req. for § 3621(e) Offense Review at 1-2 (Nov. 18, 2014).

       B.     The Felon in Possession Offense

       On September 26, 2003, a federal grand jury indicted Mr. Leland for being a

 felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g). Second Superseding

 Indictment at 6-7 (ECF No. 60).        Count Fourteen of the second superseding

 indictment charged that Mr. Leland had been convicted of a crime publishable by



                                           70
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 71 of 76        PageID #: 1522



 imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, specifically Receiving Stolen Property,

 Superior Court, Penobscot County, March 22, 1983, Docket Number CR-83-216. Id.

 It further charged that in or about December 2002 in the District of Maine, Mr.

 Leland knowingly possessed in and affecting interstate commerce the following

 firearms: (1) a Colt, MK IV, .45 cal. pistol, Serial Number FC25560, (2) a Ruger,

 GP100, .357 mag. Cal. revolver, Serial Number 171-97086, and (3) a Beretta, Model

 9000S, .40 caliber pistol, Serial Number SN011117. Id.

       On January 27, 2004, Mr. Leland entered a plea of guilty to the firearm charge

 along with a number of other charges. Minute Entry (ECF No. 205). The Government

 prepared a prosecution version of the offenses for purposes of the Rule 11 hearing.

 Gov’t’s Version of the Offense (ECF No. 206). Regarding the firearms possession

 charge, the prosecution version reads:

       The evidence and testimony also would show that as of 2002 and 2003,
       the defendant had been convicted of a crime which under the laws of the
       State of Maine was then punishable by imprisonment for a term
       exceeding one year, specifically, Receiving Stolen Property, Superior
       Court, Penobscot County, March 22, 1983, Docket Number CR-83-216,
       and that the defendant knowingly possessed the three firearms listed in
       Count Fourteen and that none of the firearms were manufactured in
       Maine. The evidence would show that the defendant either gave, or
       received, each firearm as a gift.

 Id. at 2. During the Rule 11 hearing, Mr. Leland assured the Court that he was

 pleading guilty because he was actually guilty. Rule 11 Hr’g 5:16-19. After being

 reminded that he had to be honest with the Court, Mr. Leland confirmed that he had

 read the Government’s Version of the Offense and that he did not disagree with any




                                          71
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 72 of 76           PageID #: 1523



 of the contents of the Government’s Version and that the contents of the

 Government’s Version were true to his own personal knowledge. Id. 18:5-18.

       C.       Expunging the Firearms Conviction

       Mr. Leland cites no authority for his request that the Court expunge his

 firearms conviction and the Court could find none. There is very limited statutory

 authority for a federal court to expunge a criminal record and none of those provisions

 applies here. See 28 U.S.C. § 534(a) (requiting the Attorney General to “acquire,

 collect, classify and preserve” criminal identification records); 5 U.S.C. § 552a(d),

 (g)(1)(C) (allowing claims to amend public records that are inaccurate); 21 U.S.C. §

 844a(j) (allowing for expungement of civil penalty records in certain drug possession

 cases); 10 U.S.C. § 1565(e) (requiring the Secretary of Defense to expunge the records

 of a DNA analysis when a court overturns a military conviction); 18 U.S.C. § 3607(c)

 (authorizing a federal court to expunge the record of the disposition of a Controlled

 Substance Act offense when the person received pre-judgment probation, was less

 than twenty-one years old at the time of the offense, and the person applies for the

 expungement order); 42 U.S.C. § 14132(d) (permitting the Director of the FBI to

 expunge DNA records of individuals in certain cases where the convictions were

 overturned).

       Mr. Leland’s request for expungement is bottomed on the ancillary

 consequences within the BOP of his conviction and he makes an equitable plea for

 the Court’s intervention. However, in United States v. Coloian, 480 F.3d 47 (1st Cir.

 2007), the First Circuit joined those circuits that have concluded that a district court



                                           72
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 73 of 76            PageID #: 1524



 does “not have jurisdiction to consider [a defendant’s] request for the expungement of

 his criminal record on equitable grounds.” Id. at 52; Boroian v. Mueller, 616 F.3d 60,

 67 (1st Cir. 2010) (addressing identification records of convicted felons). As this Court

 owes allegiance to the pronouncements of law from the First Circuit, the Court

 concludes that it must dismiss Mr. Leland’s motion for expungement because the

 Court has no jurisdiction to consider it.

 IV.   MOTION FOR SENTENCE REDUCTION PURSUANT TO 18 U.S.C. §
       3582(c)(2)

       On November 4, 2014, Mr. Leland filed a pro se motion under Amendment 782

 and ineffective counsel. Habeas Corpus Mot. to Correct Sentence under Amendment

 782 and Ineffective Assistance of Counsel (ECF No. 398). In the motion, he makes

 two arguments, one successful, one not. The unsuccessful argument is his claim of

 ineffective counsel. The Court addressed this issue in this Order and denies that part

 of his motion.

       Mr. Leland, however, has stated a valid claim for sentence reduction under

 Amendment 782 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines. See U.S. SENTENCING

 GUIDELINES MANUAL app. C, Amendment 782 (2014). So long as the effective date of

 the order is November 1, 2015 or later, under Amendment 782, the Sentencing

 Commission has allowed for a two-level reduction in the calculation of the base

 offense level for defendants like Mr. Leland. U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10(d), (e)(1). As Mr.

 Leland’s total offense level was 38 and the criminal history category was I, his

 Guideline sentence range was from 235 to 293 months and the Court imposed a 252-

 month sentence in the lower end of the applicable Guideline sentence range.


                                             73
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 74 of 76           PageID #: 1525



 Sentencing Tr. at 102. If the two-level reduction is applied, Mr. Leland’s total offense

 level is reduced to 36. As his criminal history category remains Category I, the newly

 calculated Guideline sentence range is 188 to 235 months. In Mr. Leland’s case, the

 PO recalculated Mr. Leland’s sentence to equal 201 months, proportionally reducing

 Mr. Leland’s sentence.      Revised Presentence Investigation Report—2014 Drug

 Reduction Act (revised Feb. 23, 2015) (RPSR). The Court appointed David Beneman,

 the Federal Defender for the District of Maine, as Mr. Leland’s counsel in this matter,

 see Order Appointing Counsel Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) (ECF No. 401), and

 Federal Defender Beneman has indicated no objection to the proposed reduction to

 201 months.

       The Sentencing Commission made such reductions contingent upon the

 sentencing judge’s evaluation of the particular defendant. The Guidelines direct the

 Court to review the statutory factors in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), to assess any public

 safety considerations, and to evaluate the defendant’s post-sentencing conduct before

 acting on motion for reduction. U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10(e)(1)(B). The statutory factors in

 § 3553(a) include such factors as the defendant’s history and characteristics, the

 nature and circumstances of his offenses, the need to protect the public from future

 crimes of the defendant, the need to provide the defendant with educational training

 or corrective treatment. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).

       The Court has repeatedly told Mr. Leland that it has been pleased to learn he

 has done so well during incarceration. Mr. Leland is now older, and presumably

 wiser, than he was at the October 27, 2005 sentencing hearing. There is no evidence



                                           74
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 75 of 76           PageID #: 1526



 that he has violated BOP rules or has been anything other than the model prisoner

 he claims to be. The many letters that the Court received in his favor from relatives

 and friends indicate that, once released, Mr. Leland will have a strong support group.

 Although Mr. Leland’s crimes were serious and merited a significant penalty, the

 Court takes him at his word that he is a changed man, that he excommunicated

 himself from the Hells Angels, that he has taken advantage of numerous educational

 and drug rehabilitation classes, including classes on residential wiring and rebuilding

 electric motors, that he has tutored others, and that he has earned a certificate for

 paralegal studies. Finally, the newly-calculated sentence, combined with ongoing

 supervised release, should be an effective deterrent for Mr. Leland.        The Court

 suspects that having once traveled down the road of criminality and realized its

 repercussions, Mr. Leland is not likely to travel down that same road again. The

 Court’s biggest concern about Mr. Leland is his obstinate refusal to accept this Court’s

 and the First Circuit’s rulings denying his complaints about his sentence. Perhaps

 now that his sentence has been reduced to 201 months, a substantial reduction, Mr.

 Leland will finally reconcile himself to the reduced sentence and will stop, as he

 promised, his relentless and unproductive post-judgment filings.

       The Court therefore grants his motion for sentence reduction under

 Amendment 782 of the Guidelines and reduces his sentence to 201 months.

 Contemporaneous with this opinion, the Court has issued an Order Regarding Motion

 for Sentencing Reduction Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) reducing Mr. Leland’s

 sentence from 252 months to 201 months. With this opinion and result, the Court



                                           75
Case 1:03-cr-00033-JAW Document 412 Filed 04/21/15 Page 76 of 76        PageID #: 1527



 hopes that Mr. Leland is finally able to turn his attention away from attempting to

 relitigate the past and instead face the more urgent and immediate task of preparing

 for the future.

 V.    CONCLUSION

       The Court DENIES the Motion to Reconsider Petitioner’s Writ of Audita

 Querela Pursuant to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651 (ECF No. 408).

       The Court DENIES Defendant’s Motion to Expunge Conviction (ECF No. 411).

       The Court DENIES in part and GRANTS in part Defendant’s Habeas Corpus

 Motion to Correct Sentence under Amendment 782 and Ineffective Assistance of

 Counsel (ECF No. 398). The Court DENIES so much of the motion as demands relief

 based on ineffective assistance of counsel and GRANTS so much of the motion as

 demands relief pursuant to Amendment 782 of the United States Sentencing

 Commission Guidelines and reduces William Leland’s period of incarceration from

 252 to 201 months.
