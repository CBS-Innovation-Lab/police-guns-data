                 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                      DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

            v.                               Case No. 06-cr-227-01-SM

Marcos Nieves

                                    ORDER

      Defendant Nieves’ motion to continue the final pretrial conference and trial

is granted (document 8). Trial has been rescheduled for the May 2007 trial

period. Defendant Nieves shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights not later than

March 8, 2007. On the filing of such waiver, his continuance shall be effective.

      The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18

U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would

unreasonably deny defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances.

      Final Pretrial Conference: April 16, 2007 at 4:00 p.m.

      Jury Selection: May 1, 2007 at 9:30 a.m.
