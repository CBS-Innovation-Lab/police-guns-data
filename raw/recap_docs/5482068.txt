STATEMENT OF REASONS

VH COURT BETERMINATIONS OF R.ESTITUTION
A E Restituu'on Not Applicable.
B Total Arnount of Restitution:

C Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

1 i:l For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

2 ll For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of tile victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3){B).
3 l:] For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh

the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(l)03)(ii).

4 l:] Restitu‘u'on is not ordered for other reasons. (Explain.)

D l:l Partial restitution is ordered for these reasons (lS U.S.C. § 3553(c)):
