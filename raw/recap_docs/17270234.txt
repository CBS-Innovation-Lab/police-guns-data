UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

V. CR NO. O3-108~OlT

GERALD TAYLOR

ORDER DENYING PETITIONER’S MOTION FOR MODIFICATION
OF SENTENCE PURSUANT TO 18 U.S.C. §3582(€)

On February 13, 2004, Gerald Taylor pled guilty to a charge of
possessing a firearm after having been convicted of a felony in
violation of 21 U.S.C. §922(g)(l). Taylor’s guideline range was
determined to be 77 to 96 months based on a net offense level of 21
and a criminal history category of VI. Taylor was sentenced to 77
months.

Taylor has filed a motion to reduce his sentence, pursuant to
18 U.S.C. §3582(c), on the ground that, under Amendment 709 to the
guidelines adopted. November 1, 2007, he would have a lesser
criminal history category which, in turn, would result in a lower
guideline range.

Unfortunately for Taylor, Amendment 709 is not listed in
U.S.S.G. §1B1.10 as one of the amendments having retroactive
effect. Consequently, the amendment is not retroactively
applicable to Taylor’s case. See e.g. United States v. Cabrera-
Polo, 376 F.3d 29, 33 (lst Cir. 2003).

For all of the foregoing reasons, the Motion. to Modify
Sentence is hereby denied.
