               RECOMMENDED DECISION ON 28 U.S.C. § 2255 MOTION

       Cosme Sanchez Ramirez was convicted of offenses involving his unlawful possession of

a firearm and making a false statement in connection with the attempted acquisition of a firearm,

in violation of provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 922, and making a false claim of citizenship, in

violation of 18 U.S.C. § 911. See United States v. Sanchez-Ramirez, 570 F.3d 75, 77 (1st Cir.

2009). Following denial of his direct appeal, Sanchez Ramirez filed a motion to vacate his

conviction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255. (ECF No. 262.) This court denied the motion on its

merits, (ECF No. 277) and denied a certificate of appealability. Sanchez Ramirez began an

appeal of that decision. On March 1, 2011, the First Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the

appeal pursuant to Fed. R.App.P. 42(b) after construing Sanchez Ramirez’s February 1, 2011,

letter to that court as a pro se motion for voluntary dismissal. (ECF No. 285.) Approximately a

week later Sanchez Ramirez filed an unsigned motion to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal in

this court. On March 10, 2011, I entered an order giving Sanchez Ramirez until March 24, 2011,

to explain what relief he sought in his unsigned motion. (See ECF No. 289.) On March 21,

2011, Sanchez Ramirez filed a response indicating that he wanted this court to vacate the

judgment and mandate entered by the First Circuit Court of Appeals and reinstate his appeal.

(ECF No. 291.) On April 8, 2011, I entered an order explaining that this court could not reinstate

his appeal in the court of appeals; that type of relief, if it came at all, would have to come from

the court of appeals itself. Ultimately the defendant requested that this court reopen its own

judgment in his Section 2255 petition. The presiding judge denied his request, denied a

certificate of appealability, and denied a motion for reconsideration, the last event occurring on

December 11, 2012. Sanchez Ramirez filed an appeal of the decision denying his request to

reopen. Ultimately the Court of Appeals denied a certificate of appealability (ECF No. 312),

effectively terminating Sanchez Ramirez’s appeals and attempts to reopen to the original Section

2255 merits decision which had denied relief.

       On October 24, 2013, almost one year after the previous activity, Sanchez Ramirez filed

another motion to vacate his judgment. (ECF No. 320.) This time he asserts a right to relief

under the newly minted United States Supreme Court decisions, Alleyne v. United States, 133 S.

Ct. 2151 (2013) and Descamps v. United States, 133 S. Ct. 2276 (2013). However, the pending

motion constitutes a “second or successive motion” under 28 U.S.C. § 2244, and consequently

this court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the motion, pursuant to 2244(b)(3)(A), which provides:

“Before a second or successive application permitted by this section is filed in the district court,

the applicant shall move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district

court to consider the application.” See also First Circuit Local Rule 22.1. The pending motion

attacks the same amended criminal judgment as the first motion did, and the first motion

terminated with a judgment on the merits. See United States v. Barrett, 178 F.3d 34, 43 (1st Cir.

1999) (“[A] numerically second petition is not ‘second or successive’ if it attacks a different

criminal judgment or if the earlier petition terminated without a judgment on the merits.”)

(quoting Pratt v. United States, 129 F.3d 54, 60 (1st Cir. 1997) (quotation marks omitted)). None

of the reasons for determining that a motion is not “second or successive” applies here. See id. at

43-44.

         Until the Court of Appeals authorizes this court to determine the matter, this court does

not have jurisdiction to decide whether Alleyne constitutes a new rule that is to be applied

retroactively to a second or successive petition. Section 2244(b)(3) deprives this court of

jurisdiction to make such a determination at this point in the litigation. See Pratt, 129 F.3d at 57.

Rather, the statute grants jurisdiction instead to the Court of Appeals, and requires a prima facie

showing before the Court of Appeals may authorize the district court to consider a second or

successive motion. “The court of appeals may authorize the filing of a second or successive

application only if it determines that the application makes a prima facie showing that the

application satisfies the requirements of this subsection.” 28 U.S.C. §2244(b)(3)(C).

Accordingly I recommend that this court summarily dismiss this petition.

                                             Conclusion

         For the reasons stated above, no evidentiary hearing is warranted under Rule 8 of the Rules

Governing Section 2255 Cases, and I recommend that the Court deny Sanchez Ramirez’s motion for

habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. I further recommend that the Court deny a certificate of

appealability pursuant to Rule 11 of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Cases because there is no

substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. §

2253(c)(2).

                                              NOTICE

                A party may file objections to those specified portions of a magistrate
         judge’s report or proposed findings or recommended decisions entered pursuant to
         28 U.S.C. 636(b)(1)(B) for which de novo review by the district court is sought,
         together with a supporting memorandum, within fourteen (14) days of being
         served with a copy thereof. A responsive memorandum shall be filed within
         fourteen (14) days after the filing of the objection.

             Failure to file a timely objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to de
      novo review by the district court and to appeal the district court's order.
