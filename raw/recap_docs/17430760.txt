                    ORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS INDICTMENT

       Claiming violations of his due process and Second Amendment rights, Curtis Todd

Zetterman moves to dismiss the indictment charging him with violating federal criminal law by

possessing a firearm after having been committed to a mental institution. The Court denies the

motion based on its prior rulings in United States v. Murphy and United States v. Small.

I.     STATEMENT OF FACTS

       A.      Procedural History

       On April 19, 2009, a federal grand jury indicted Curtis Zetterman for possession of a

firearm after having been committed to a mental institution, a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(4).

Indictment (Docket # 3).     On February 19, 2010, Curtis Zetterman moved to dismiss the

indictment on two grounds: first, that application of § 922(g)(4) to the facts in this case would

violate Mr. Zetterman’s due process rights under the Fifth Amendment of the United States

Constitution; and, second, that application of § 922(g)(4) to the facts in this case deprives Mr.

Zetterman of his Second Amendment right to bear arms. Mot. to Dismiss Indictment (Docket #

51) (Def.’s Mot.). The Government responded on February 19, 2010. Gov’t’s Resp. to Def.’s

Mot. to Dismiss Indictment (Docket # 56). Mr. Zetterman replied on March 4, 2010. Def.’s

       B.      Mr. Zetterman’s Proffer

       Mr. Zetterman says that on April 26, 2006 he was admitted on an emergency basis to

Acadia Hospital pursuant to 34-B M.R.S.A. § 3863, a Maine statute that allows for emergency

hospitalization based on the asserted belief of an applicant that a person is mentally ill and

because of the illness poses a likelihood of serious harm, a doctor’s written certification to the

same effect, and judicial approval of the application. Def.’s Mot. at 4; 34-B M.R.S.A. § 3863(1),

(2), (3).   Mr. Zetterman acknowledges that the “Application for Emergency Involuntary

Admission to a Mental Hospital was made by a crisis clinician, was certified by a Medical

Doctor, and certified as to regularity by a District Court judge.” Def.’s Mot. at 4. Mr. Zetterman

“voluntarily participated in treatment while at Acadia Hospital and was discharged by that

hospital on April 20, 2006.” Id. Mr. Zetterman was arrested on October 20, 2008 by police who

were “responding to a report of threatening behavior by Mr. Zetterman against another person.”

Id.

       C.      Legal Contentions

       Mr. Zetterman contends that to treat an emergency psychiatric commitment under Maine

statutory law as a commitment under federal criminal law violates his right to due process and

“renders the statute, as so construed, unconstitutional.” Id. at 3. He says despite the fact he was

never allowed a commitment hearing, the preemptory emergency process in Maine results in a

“permanent deprivation of liberty without the process due under the Fifth Amendment.” Id.

       Mr. Zetterman’s Second Amendment argument is that criminalizing the possession of

firearms by any person “who has been committed to a mental institution,” 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(4),

violates the Second Amendment, because it “creates an over-broad deprivation of a core

constitutional right that does not withstand intermediate scrutiny.” Id. at 4. This is so, he claims,

because “many who are mentally ill are not also dangerous.” Id.

II.    DISCUSSION

       This is not the first time the Court has addressed these arguments. In United States v.

Murphy, CR-09-157-B-W, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11364 (D. Me. Feb. 3, 2010) and United

States v. Small, CR-09-184-B-W 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13698 (D. Me. Feb. 16, 2010), the

Court addressed the same due process and Second Amendment issues that Mr. Zetterman raises

here. Mr. Zetterman does not contend that there are factual differences between his case and the

Murphy and Small cases that would command a different decision, and the Court perceives none.

Accordingly, the Court applies the same reasoning in Murphy and Small to the same issues

presented here and arrives at the same result.

III.   CONCLUSION

       The Court DENIES the Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss the Indictment (Docket # 51).

       SO ORDERED.
