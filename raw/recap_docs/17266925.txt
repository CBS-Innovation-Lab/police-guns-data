UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

V. Cr. NO. 97-102T

LUIS PINET

ORDER DENYING MOTION TO APPOINT COUNSEL

Luis Pinet has filed a motion for appointment of counsel in
order to file a motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to 18
U.S.C. §3582(c)(2). A review of the record indicates that the
defendant is ineligible for a reduction in sentence pursuant to 18
U.S.C. §3582(c) because he is classified as a career offender and
his sentencing guideline remains unchanged. Therefore, the motion

to appoint counsel is denied.
