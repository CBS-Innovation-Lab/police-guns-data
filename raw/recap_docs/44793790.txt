                       ORDER ON SENTENCING ISSUES

      Applying binding First Circuit law, the Court concludes that a defendant who

has four state of Maine burglary convictions is subject to the enhanced penalty

provisions of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) and its corresponding guideline

provision. The Court does not conclude that the defendant possessed a firearm in

connection with another felony offense, obstructed justice, or should be denied

acceptance under the guidelines.

I.    GENERAL BACKGROUND

      On November 10, 2016, a federal grand jury indicted Jonathan Bowers for

possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a number of felonies, an alleged

violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). Indictment (ECF No. 1). On September 14, 2017,

Mr. Bowers pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm. Minute Entry

(ECF No. 56). On February 7, 2018, the Court held a presentence conference and

counsel requested that the Court schedule an evidentiary hearing to resolve some

sentencing issues. Minute Entry (ECF No. 67); Notice of Hr’g (ECF No. 68). After

some delay, the Court held the evidentiary hearing on July 24, 2018. Minute Entry
(ECF No. 82). A transcript of the hearing was filed on August 7, 2018. Tr. of

Proceedings, Evidentiary Hr’g (ECF No. 85) (Tr.).

         On September 4, 2018, the parties filed simultaneous memoranda. Mem. in

Aid of Sentencing (ECF No. 86) (Def.’s Mem.); Gov’t’s Sentencing Mem. (ECF No. 87)

(Gov’t’s Mem.). On September 18, 2018, the parties filed simultaneous responses.

Reply Mem. in Aid of Sentencing (ECF No. 88) (Def.’s Opp’n); Gov’t’s Sentencing Resp.

(ECF No. 89) (Gov’t’s Opp’n). On September 26, 2018, Mr. Bowers filed a personal

narrative and a narrative from Deputy Sheriff Jeremy A. York.            My Personal

Narrative, Def.’s Ex. 1 (ECF No. 90) (Def.’s Statement); Id. Narrative for Dep. Jeremy

A. York, Def.’s Ex. 2 (York Narrative).

II.      THE LEGAL ISSUES

      The parties briefed the following legal issues:

      (1) whether Mr. Bowers is subject to the provisions of the Armed Career Criminal

Act (ACCA);

      (2) whether Mr. Bowers used his firearm in connection with another felony and is

subject to a four-level sentencing enhancement under United States Sentencing

Commission Guideline (U.S.S.G.) § 2K2.1(b)(6)(B);

      (3) whether Mr. Bowers is subject to a two-level sentencing enhancement under

U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1; and

      (4) whether Mr. Bowers is entitled to a three-level reduction for acceptance of

responsibility under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1.

III.     THE ARMED CAREER CRIMINAL ACT



                                             2
        A.      Background

        Known as the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), title 18 of United States

Code section 924(e) provides enhanced penalties for illegal firearm possession:

        In the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of this title and has
        three previous convictions by any court referred to in section 922(g)(1)
        of this title for a violent felony . . . committed on occasions different from
        one another, such person shall be fined under this title and imprisoned
        not less than fifteen years, and, notwithstanding any other provision of
        law, the court shall not suspend the sentence of, or grant a probationary
        sentence to, such person with respect to the conviction under section
        922(g).

§ 924(e)(1). 1 ACCA defines “violent felony” as:

        [A]ny crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year
        . . . that--

        (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or
        otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of
        physical injury to another . . . .

§ 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). 2 This clause is known as the enumerated clause, because it lists

specific crimes that qualify as ACCA predicates. See Dimott v. United States, 881

F.3d 232, 234 (1st Cir. 2018) (discussing the enumerated clause). In addition to the

ACCA, the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines have a provision that




1        Section 924(e)(1) includes “a serious drug offense” as a potential predicate. But Mr. Bowers
has not previously been convicted of any drug offenses, so the Court limits its analysis to the burglary
convictions.
2        Section 924(e)(2)(B)(i) contains a definition of “violent felony” that includes a felony that “has
as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of
another.” Section 924(e)’s “force clause” is not at issue in this case. Also, § 924(e)(2)(C) addresses
juvenile convictions and is not relevant here. In Johnson v. United States, __ U.S. __, 135 S. Ct. 2551
(2015), the United States Supreme Court invalidated the so-called residual clause of § 924(e)(2)(B)
holding that it violated the Constitution’s guarantee of due process. The residual clause is not at issue
in this case.

                                                    3
dovetails with the ACCA and enhances the calculation of the sentencing guideline

range for a person subject to the ACCA. U.S.S.G. § 4B1.4 (Armed Career Criminal).

      Mr. Bowers’ Presentence Investigation Report details his criminal record.

Presentence Investigation Report (PSR). Relevant to his ACCA status, the PSR lists

the following burglary convictions:

      (1) 5/12/2010 (Date of Arrest): Count 1: Burglary (Class B), Kennebec
          County Superior Court, Augusta, Maine, Docket No. 2010-CR-00335;
          07/08/10: Ct. 1: 5 years DOC (Department of Corrections), all but 6
          months suspended, 3 years probation.

      (2) 6/29/2006 (Date of Arrest): Count 2: Burglary (Class B), Count 4:
          Burglary (Class C), Kennebec County Superior Court, Augusta,
          Maine, Docket No.: 2006-CR-00660; Counts 2: 4 years DOC, all but
          60 days suspended, 3 years probation, $17,150 restitution; Count 4:
          60 days concurrent to Count 2;

      (3) 6/15/2006 (Date of Arrest): Count 1: Burglary (Class C), Kennebec
          County Superior Court, Augusta, Maine, Docket No.: 2006-CR-
          00747; Count 1: 60 days jail to be served concurrently with CR-06-
          660 and each other.

PSR ¶¶ 30-31, 36. The Government and Mr. Bowers disagree as to whether these

four burglary convictions qualify him for ACCA status.

      B.     The Positions of the Parties

             1.    Jonathan Bowers’ Position

      Although Mr. Bowers concedes that he has four prior burglary convictions from

the state of Maine, he maintains that his burglary convictions do not count as ACCA

predicates because Maine’s definition of “structure” is broader than the generic

definition of structure allows. Def.’s Mem. at 7-8. Thus, he contends, the Court may




                                         4
examine so-called Shepard 3 documents. Id. at 8-9. Mr. Bowers argues that an

examination of the Rule 11 colloquy for his June 15, 2006 burglary demonstrates that

he entered into a storage trailer, not a dwelling, which he contends does not fit within

the generic definition of burglary. Id.

             2.      The Government’s Position

      From the Government’s perspective, the issue begins and ends with Mr.

Bowers’ convictions for burglary under state of Maine law. Gov’t’s Mem. at 5-7. The

Government points out that in United States v. Duquette, 778 F.3d 314, 318 (1st Cir.

2015), the First Circuit concluded that Maine’s burglary statute “is indivisible and

that [it] falls within the generic definition of burglary as defined by Taylor [v. United

States, 495 U.S. 575 (1990)].” Id. at 7. In the Government’s view, Duquette “remains

controlling precedent in this circuit.” Id. Furthermore, the Government contends

that under Supreme Court authority, Descamps v. United States, 570 U.S. 254, 261

(2013) and Mathis v. United States, __ U.S. __, 136 S. Ct. 2243, 2248 (2016), “the

proffered Shepard documents cannot be considered, and the defendant’s attempt at

collateral attack in his forum must fail.” Id. The Government maintains that Mathis

did not overrule Duquette and therefore Mr. Bowers’ “Maine burglary convictions

qualify as ACCA predicates.” Id.

             3.      Jonathan Bowers’ Opposition

      In his response, Mr. Bowers argues that in Duquette, the First Circuit did not

“look at or consider the definitions of “structure” and “dwelling place.” Def.’s Opp’n



3     Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13 (2005).

                                               5
at 4-5. Mr. Bowers says that in Mathis, the Supreme Court provided “a new and

different task for determining whether the ‘means’ in the Maine burglary statute—

and not the ‘elements’—require this court to find that the Maine burglary statute

qualifies for purposes of the ACCA.” Id. at 5. Mr. Bowers observes that in Mathis,

the United States Supreme Court “held that an Iowa burglary statute that contained

a similar definition of ‘structure’ to the Maine statute did not quality for ACCA

purposes because it provided for alternative means for commission of burglary, which

were broader in definition than the generic definition of burglary.” Id. (citing Mathis,

136 S. Ct. at 2257).      He also contends that Mathis authorized the Court’s

consideration of the Shepard documents that he provided. Id. at 6 (citing Mathis, 137

S. Ct. at 2257, n.7). Mr. Bowers concedes that “Duquette may still be good law for the

proposition that when the elements of the crime are viewed on the face of the statute

alone, then Maine’s burglary statute is a generic statute.” Id. However, he argues

that “Mathis . . . requires an additional analysis of alternative means of

communication, which were not considered by the Duquette court.” Id. When the

Mathis analysis is performed, he writes, “it is clear that the alternative locational

means of committing burglary in Maine make the statute broader than the generic

version and Maine’s burglary statute can no longer qualify for ACCA purposes.” Id.

             4.     The Government’s Opposition

      The Government responds that “Duquette is still controlling precedent in the

First Circuit and must, therefore, be applied in this case.” Gov’t’s Opp’n at 1. In

support, the Government cites Dimott, 881 F.3d at 234 n.1. Id. The Government



                                           6
notes that in his dissent, Judge Torruella observed that the district court is still

bound by the circuit rule in Duquette despite Mathis. Id. (citing Dimott, 881 F.3d at

246) (Torrurella J., dissenting)). Moreover, the Government argues that “Mathis

decides nothing new” and is a mere “reassertion of the rules set forth in Taylor.” Id.

at 2. “Simply put, since Mathis has not changed the ruling of Taylor on which

Duquette was based, there is no basis in Mathis for now ignoring Duquette.” Id.

      In addition, the Government says that Mr. Bowers’ argument is foreclosed by

his concession that the Maine burglary statute is an indivisible statute. Id. With

that concession, the Government argues, Mr. Bowers may not look outside the statute

itself under Taylor and Mathis. Id. To do so, in the Government’s view, would require

the Court to make a forbidden “factual determination of the nature of the places he

burglarized.” Id. at 3.

      Finally, the Government rejects Mr. Bowers’ position that because at the Rule

11, the state prosecutor described the structure Mr. Bowers burglarized as a storage

trailer, this means that the structure was mobile. Id. In the Government’s words,

“just as wood can become a house, so too can a once mobile object become a stationary

structure.” Id. Thus, “even if Bowers is to be believed, it does not necessarily follow

that the places he burglarized were not structures within the meaning of Taylor,

Mathis, and Duquette.” Id.

      C.     DISCUSSION

      On its face, the resolution of this issue appears easy. The ACCA applies if a

defendant has previously committed at least three violent felonies.        The ACCA



                                          7
defines a “violent felony” to include “burglary,” and Mr. Bowers had been convicted of

four burglaries, all felonies, before committing his present felony of being a felon in

possession of a firearm crime. The conclusion that Mr. Bowers is subject to the

enhanced sentencing provisions of the ACCA would seem a foregone conclusion.

      But something so significant in the law is rarely so simple. In Taylor, the

United States Supreme Court addressed the problem that “[t]he word ‘burglary’ has

not been given a single meaning by the state courts; the criminal codes of the States

define burglary in many different ways.”       495 U.S. at 580.     The Taylor Court

concluded that the term, “burglary,” “must have some uniform definition independent

of the labels employed by the various States’ criminal codes.”        Id. at 592. The

Supreme Court adopted the following “generic” definition of “burglary” for purposes

of the ACCA: “An unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or

other structure, with intent to commit a crime.” Id. at 598.

      Significantly, for purposes of Mr. Bowers’ argument, the Supreme Court

elected not to limit the generic definition of burglary to buildings, but included

“structures.” Id. (citing W. LAFAVE & A. SCOTT, SUBSTANTIVE CRIMINAL LAW § n.3, §§

8.13(c), p. 471(1986) (“modern statutes ‘typically describe the place as a ‘building’ or

‘structure’”)). The Taylor Court also established an analytic framework under which

the question of whether a state burglary statute constitutes a generic burglary that

the ACCA recognizes as a predicate felony. The Supreme Court wrote that if the state

statute is narrower than a generic burglary, there is “no problem, because the

conviction necessarily implies that the defendant has been found guilty of all the



                                           8
elements of generic burglary.” Id. at 599. “And if the defendant was convicted of

burglary in a State where the generic definition of has been adopted, with minor

variations in terminology, then the trial court need find only that the state statute

corresponds in substance to the generic meaning of burglary.” Id.

      In 2015, in Duquette, the First Circuit directly addressed whether a conviction

under the Maine burglary statute is a proper ACCA predicate. 778 F.3d 314. The

state burglary statute for Mr. Bowers’ and Mr. Duquette’s convictions is 17-A M.R.S.

§ 401. Mr. Bowers was convicted of violating both 17-A M.R.S. § 401(1)(A) and §

401(1)(B)(4):

   1. A person is guilty of burglary if:

   A. The person enters or surreptitiously remains in a structure knowing
      that that person is not licensed or privileged to do so, with the intent to
      commit a crime therein. Violation of this paragraph is a Class C crime;
      or

   B. The person violates paragraph A and:

      (4) The violation is against a structure that is a dwelling place. Violation
      of this subparagraph is a Class B crime.

To be guilty of a § 401(1)(B)(4) violation, Mr. Bowers first had to be guilty of violating

§ 401(1)(A). Like Mr. Bowers, Mr. Duquette was convicted of violating. § 401(1)(A).

      In Duquette, the First Circuit ruled:

      By its clear and unambiguous terms, the statute [17-A M.R.S. § 401(1)]
      contains all of the elements of "generic burglary" that the Supreme
      Court set forth in Taylor. Duquette, in fact, concedes this in his brief.
      See Appellant's Br. at 8 (quoting Taylor, 495 U.S. at 599 . . . ("The
      statutory elements match the elements of 'generic burglary' defined as
      'unlawful or unprivileged entry to a building or structure with the intent
      to commit a crime.'")). We find, therefore, that this statutory definition



                                            9
      of burglary "substantially corresponds to 'generic' burglary." Taylor, 495
      U.S. at 602 . . . .

778 F.3d at 318. The First Circuit made its holding plain: “because Maine’s burglary

statute sets forth the definition of ‘generic burglary’ under Taylor, a conviction under

that statute qualifies as a “violent felony” under the ACCA.” Id. Applying Duquette

to Mr. Bowers’ case, his four Maine burglary convictions count as ACCA predicates

and he is therefore subject to the mandatory provisions of the law and the Armed

Career Criminal provision of the Guidelines.

      Mr. Bower, however, urges the Court to discount Duquette because after the

First Circuit issued Duquette, the United States Supreme Court decided Mathis and,

in Mr. Bowers’ view, Mathis dictates a different result. Mr. Bowers is not the first to

attack Duquette following Mathis. The judges in this District have issued a number

of opinions after Mathis, addressing issues similar to the issue Mr. Bowers is raising;

each applies Duquette. Yeaton v. United States, No. 2:04-cr-00123-GZS, 2:16-cv-

00333-GZS, 2017 WL 1194185, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47386 (Mar. 30, 2017),

affirmed 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66365 (May 2, 2017) (certificate of appealability

granted); McCurdy v. United States, Nos. 1:06-cr-00080-JAW, 1:15-cv-00532-JAW,

2017 WL 74695, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1947 (D. Me. Jan. 6, 2017); Collamore v.

United States, Nos. 2:10-cr-158-GZS, 2:16-cv-259-GZS, 2016 WL 6304668, 2016 U.S.

Dist. LEXIS 148757 (D. Me. Oct. 27, 2016); United States v. Casey, Nos. 2:11-cr-216-

DBH, 2:16-cv-346-DBH, 2016 WL 6581178, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 153085 (D. Me.

Nov. 3, 2016); Dimott v. United States, Nos. 2:06-cr-26-GZS, 2:16-cv-347-GZS, 2016

U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142354 (Oct. 14, 2016). In explaining why it is following Duquette,

                                          10
the Court can do no better than what it and the other district judges have already

done.

        In Dimott, the First Circuit addressed appeals in the Dimott, Casey, and

Collamore cases but did not directly reach the Mathis argument because of issues

unique to those cases. 881 F.3d at 233-43. In dissent, Judge Torruella observed that

in Casey, the district court concluded it was “bound by this Circuit’s precedent to find

that Maine burglary is generic and also falls under the enumerated clause.” Id. at

246 (Torruella, J., dissenting). Judge Torruella wrote that “[t]he district court was

correct in its ruling given its boundaries.” Id. Judge Torruella suggested that the

First Circuit itself is not “so constrained” in assessing the continued vitality of its own

precedent. Id. The lesson from Judge Torruella’s dissent in Dimott is that if Duquette

is to be revisited, the First Circuit, not a district court, must do so.

        Although the appeal in McCurdy has been dismissed, the district court docket

sheet reflects that Mr. Yeaton appealed the district court decision to the First Circuit

and that his appeal is still pending before the Circuit. Yeaton v. United States, No.

2:04-cr-00123-GZS-1, Notice of Appeal (ECF No. 55). The Government states that a

similar question is now pending before the United States Supreme Court in United

States v. Stitt, 860 F.3d 854 (6th Cir. 2017), cert. granted 138 S. Ct. 1592 (2018), and

is scheduled for oral argument before the high court on October 9, 2018. 4 Based on


4       While this Order was being drafted, the Supreme Court of the United States heard two cases
concerning the ACCA and the implication of prior burglary convictions. United States v. Stitt, 860 F.3d
854 (6th Cir. 2017), cert. granted, 138 S. Ct. 1592 (No. 17-765); United States v. Sims, 854 F.3d 1037
(8th Cir. 2017), cert. granted, 138 S. Ct. 1592 (No. 17-766). At oral argument for the consolidated case
involving the Sims’ and Stitts’ petitions, Justice Alito stated, “a majority of the Court really hates
ACCA and is picking it apart bit by bit by bit.” Tr. 25:12-15. While it is difficult to read the tea leaves
from an oral argument, Justice Alito’s comments suggest that the Supreme Court may further narrow

                                                   11
these developments, the status of the Maine burglary statute as an ACCA predicate

may well be clarified by the Supreme Court or by the First Circuit before Mr. Bowers

is scheduled for a sentencing hearing, and if so, this Court will of course follow the

lead of the higher appellate courts to which it owes allegiance. For now, by the same

token, the Court is required to, and will, apply First Circuit precedent in Duquette for

purposes of its sentencing of Mr. Bowers unless and until the Supreme Court eclipses

the First Circuit or the First Circuit overrules itself. The Court concludes that Mr.

Bowers is subject to the provisions of the ACCA and to the corresponding Guideline

provision for Armed Career Criminals.

IV.    USE OF A FIREARM IN CONNECTION WITH ANOTHER FELONY

       UNDER § 2K2.1(b)(6)(B)

       A.      Background

       Section 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) of the Guidelines states:

       If the defendant used or possessed any firearm . . . in connection with
       another felony offense; or possessed . . . any firearm . . . with knowledge,
       intent, or reason to believe that it would be used or possessed in
       connection with another felony offense, increase by 4 levels.

In the PSR, the Probation Office considered but rejected this enhancement based on

its view of the circumstances of Mr. Bowers’ firearm possession. PSR ¶ 21. The

Government contends that the Court should impose the four-level enhancement

because “the defendant illegally used the gun in his altercation with Mr. Taylor”




the applicable predicate state convictions for ACCA. It may be sensible to wait for the Supreme Court
to issue an opinion on Sims and Stitt before sentencing Mr. Bowers. According to the PSR, Mr. Bowers
has been detained since September 14, 2017 and therefore, he is not in imminent danger of overstaying
his sentence, whichever guideline range applies.

                                                 12
which it maintains constituted a violation of a variety of Maine state criminal laws.

Gov’t’s Mem. at 2-3. 5 Mr. Bowers objects, contending that Mr. Bowers did not draw

his firearm and, if he did, his resort to a firearm was a response to aggressive behavior

by Justin Taylor and therefore, Mr. Bowers was acting in self-defense. Def.’s Opp’n.

at 1-2.

          In its response, the Government concedes that even if the video does not show

Mr. Bowers “fully produc[ing] his firearm and point[ing] the muzzle at Mr. Taylor

before Mr. Taylor struck Mr. Bowers with a wrench[,]” Gov’t’s Opp’n at 3-4, Mr.

Bowers, nevertheless, reached behind his back with his right hand and pulled his

hand up, an act that the Government contends is “consistent with attempting to draw

the firearm from the holster Bowers admitted he was wearing all day.” Id. at 4. The

Government argues that the “salient fact” is Mr. Taylor’s testimony that Mr. Bowers

had threatened to kill him, which then caused Mr. Taylor to strike Mr. Bowers with

the wrench. Id. Threatening to kill Mr. Taylor while putting his hand on his gun

constitutes, in the Government’s view, the commission of one of a number of state




5        The Government says that Mr. Bowers’ actions violated the following Maine criminal laws:
Threatening with a Dangerous Weapon, 17-A M.R.S. § 209, Reckless Conduct with a Dangerous
Weapon, 17-A M.R.S. § 211, Aggravated Reckless Conduct, 17-A M.R.S. § 213, and Terrorizing, 17-A
M.R.S. § 210. Criminal Threatening, Reckless Conduct, and Terrorizing are all Class D crimes;
Aggravated Reckless Conduct is a Class B crime. Under Maine law, a Class D crime—without more—
is not a felony; a Class B crime is a felony. See 17-A M.R.S. § 1252(2)(B), (D). However, under section
1252(4), if the state of Maine pleads and proves that a Class D crime was committed with the use of a
dangerous weapon, “then the sentencing class for such crime is one class higher than it would
otherwise be.” § 1252(4). Therefore, if Mr. Bowers used a dangerous weapon when he committed the
acts that would constitute any of the Class D crimes, the penalty would rise to Class C, which is a
felony. See § 1252(2)(C) (“In the case of a Class C crime, the court shall set a definite period not to
exceed 5 years”).

felonies. Id. The Government urges the Court to reject Mr. Bowers’ denials as

incredible. Id.

      Mr. Bowers sees the same evidence very differently. He says that during the

entirety of the video, “the gun is never drawn.” Def.’s Opp’n at 2 (emphasis in

original). Mr. Bowers contends that Mr. Taylor was the aggressor and when he

reached toward his back, he was “mere seconds away from being struck with a

wrench.” Id. Mr. Bowers urges the Court to reject Mr. Taylor’s testimony about

events off-camera as incredible. Id.

      B.     The July 24, 2018 Evidentiary Hearing

      On July 24, 2018, the Court held an evidentiary hearing at which Mr. Taylor,

Kara Cunningham, and Mr. Bowers testified. Tr. 19:20-119:24. In addition, the

parties admitted twenty exhibits, including a DVD of a surveillance video of the

incident of April 9, 2016. See Court Ex. List (ECF No. 84). The video contains no

audio. DVD of Surveillance Video of Apr. 9, 2016 Incident, Gov’t’s Ex. 1. Mr. Taylor

is the owner of an auto mechanic garage in Chelsea, Maine where the April 9, 2016

incident took place, and Mr. Taylor was involved in the altercation with Mr. Bowers.

Tr. 20:8-11, 21:14-22:23. Ms. Cunningham is Mr. Taylor’s girlfriend, and she was

working at Mr. Taylor’s garage the morning of April 9, 2016. Id. 62:25-72:25.

      C.     The DVD

      The admitted DVD is from a security camera located above one of the bays in

the garage. Gov’t’s Ex. 1. It is 8 minutes and 52 seconds long. It shows Mr. Bowers

cleaning up and shoveling some debris and placing it in a barrel. In the bay is also



                                        14
Katelyn Taylor, Mr. Taylor’s younger sister, and Mr. Bowers’ son. 6 After Mr. Bowers

is finished cleaning, he mills about the bay for a while. His son appears and then

goes outside. Mr. Taylor backs a vehicle into the bay and uses a hand jack to lift it

and let it down and Mr. Taylor drives the vehicle out of the garage. At this point, Mr.

Bowers, his son and Ms. Taylor are momentarily in the bay. Mr. Taylor comes in

briefly and leaves again. For a short time, Mr. Bowers and Ms. Taylor are in the bay

and then Mr. Taylor reenters, and goes into another bay. Mr. Bowers goes in and out

of the area where Mr. Taylor is located, but neither is visible. According to the video

time, this part of the DVD ends at 3:01:46.

       The next part of the DVD begins at 3:06:45. It shows Mr. Taylor and Mr.

Bowers standing on the far side of the bay, having a discussion. Mr. Taylor has what

it later confirmed as a wrench in his right hand. Ms. Taylor is standing facing Mr.

Bowers to the left side of Mr. Taylor. There is a black dog lying on the bay floor

between Mr. Taylor and Ms. Taylor. Mr. Bowers steps away twice, first at 3:07:27,

returning at 3:07:32, and he momentarily walks away at 3:07:42-43. Mr. Bowers

stands with his legs crossed and his left arm resting against a stack of tires.

       At 3:07:58, Mr. Taylor becomes animated. Even though there is no audio, it

appears that Mr. Taylor is raising his voice and he begins waving the wrench and

moving toward Mr. Bowers. At 3:08:00, Mr. Taylor starts walking toward Mr. Bowers

and gesticulating. The videotaped portion of this part of the encounter lasts only

about seven seconds. Ms. Taylor steps between her brother and Mr. Bowers at


6      The video has no audio, but during his testimony, Mr. Taylor identified the young woman as
Katelyn, his younger sister, and the boy as Mr. Bowers’ son. Tr. 23:23-24:11.

                                               15
3:08:00. She is initially facing Mr. Bowers and she holds him at arm’s length with

both arms at 3:08:02. She then positions herself between the two men with her right

arm on her brother’s chest and her left arm on Mr. Bowers’ chest. Mr. Taylor breaks

over his sister’s arm and lunges at Mr. Bowers, striking him with the wrench. The

three disappear out the bay door at 3:08:09 with Mr. Bowers backing up and Mr.

Taylor moving forward.

      Focusing on Mr. Bowers, he is wearing a t-shirt that is not tucked in. At

3:07:58, when Mr. Taylor becomes animated and waves the wrench, Mr. Bowers takes

his right hand and pulls up the right rear side of his t-shirt, seeming to reach for his

gun, which is in a holster on his right rear hip. In doing so, he pulls the t-shirt up

over the holster, exposing it. He does not, however, pull out the firearm. He pushes

Ms. Taylor’s arms away and backs up one large step. As Mr. Taylor continues to

approach, Mr. Bowers reaches again for the holster, and about at the same moment

Mr. Taylor lunges toward him. The three disappear out the bay with Mr. Taylor

swinging the wrench and Mr. Bowers flailing his arms.

      According to the PSR, Mr. Taylor hit Mr. Bowers on the head with the wrench

one to three times, and knocked him unconscious. PSR ¶ 8. While Mr. Bowers was

on his back, Mr. Taylor hit him with his fists one to three more times. Id. The PSR

says that Mr. Bowers “reportedly possessed a handgun in his hand while on the

ground and unconscious.” Id. This is not shown, however, in the DVD.

      Based on the DVD alone, the Court would not conclude that Mr. Bowers

possessed the firearm in connection with another felony. The crimes of Criminal



                                          16
Threatening, 17-A M.R.S. § 209, Reckless Conduct, 17-A M.R.S. § 211, and

Terrorizing, 17-A M.R.S. § 210, are all Class D crimes, which are misdemeanors

under Maine law. 17-A M.R.S. § 1252(2)(D) (“In the case of a Class D crime, the court

shall set a definite period of less than one year”). To elevate a Class D crime to a

Class C crime, which is a felony, the state of Maine must prove that the defendant

committed the crime “with the use of a dangerous weapon.” 17-A M.R.S. § 1252(4).

The DVD reveals no evidence that Mr. Bowers used his firearm to commit any of

these crimes.

      Aggravated reckless conduct is a Class B crime and is a felony. 17-A M.R.S. §

213(2); 17-A M.R.S. § 1254(2)(B) (“In the case of a Class B crime, the court shall set a

definite period not to exceed 10 years”). However, to be guilty of aggravated reckless

conduct, a defendant “with terroristic intent engages in conduct that in fact creates a

substantial risk of serious bodily injury to another person.” 17-A M.R.S. § 213(1).

The DVD itself, however, does not reveal that Mr. Bowers was engaged in conduct

that created a substantial risk of bodily injury to Mr. Taylor. If anything, Mr. Taylor,

by initiating contact with Mr. Bowers and swinging a wrench at him, was the

aggressor and it was Mr. Bowers who sustained a serious bodily injury.

      D.     The Testimonial Hearing

      As Mr. Taylor recalled it, he and Mr. Bowers were arguing because Mr. Bowers

had been rude to a customer. Tr. 21:17-22. Mr. Taylor testified that the argument

“escalated quickly” and he told Mr. Bowers that he would “call the cops if he didn’t

leave.” Id. 21:23-25. He said that Mr. Bowers was “still walking back and forth



                                          17
arguing, ripped his sweatshirt off, wanting to fight.” Id. 21:24-22:1. Mr. Taylor said

that Mr. Bowers was “acting like he wanted to fight,” “kept reaching for his gun,”

“went to pull the gun,” and “that’s when I swung.” Id. 22:4-7. Mr. Taylor testified

that Mr. Bowers told him, “I will fucking kill you,” and that he reached for his gun.

Id. 26:21-27:1. As he recalled it, Mr. Bowers reached for his gun, which caused Mr.

Taylor to start swinging. Id. 26:24-27:5.

      On cross-examination, Mr. Taylor acknowledged that in one of his earlier

statements, he had written that Mr. Bowers had pulled his gun and that he hit Mr.

Bowers after that.    Id. 38:22-39:5.   However, during his testimony, Mr. Taylor

admitted that the video reveals he had begun hitting Mr. Bowers before Mr. Bowers

pulled his gun. Id. 38:6-9. He admitted that his written statement to the sheriff’s

office made no mention of Mr. Bowers’ threat. Id. 38:12-39:2. He also agreed that he

had told Agent Christopher Concannon that he only swung the wrench after Mr.

Bowers had pulled a gun. Id. 40:15-17.

      During his testimony, Mr. Bowers recalled the details of the argument between

Mr. Taylor and himself, and Mr. Taylor telling him to leave his premises. Id. 90:5-

24. Mr. Bowers pointed to his “lackadaisical demeanor” and said that the “only

person advancing is Justin.” Id. 92:3-6. As Mr. Taylor advanced, Mr. Bowers thought

that Mr. Taylor was going to hit him with the wrench. Id. 92:7-9. Mr. Bowers denied

telling Mr. Taylor that he would “fucking kill” him. Id. 99:2-7. He said, “I don’t speak

like that.” Id.




                                            18
       Although Mr. Taylor and Mr. Bowers disagree on some essential points, the

Court concludes that their testimony, along with the testimony of Kara Cunningham,

does not sustain the Government’s burden of proof to demonstrate that it is more

likely than not that Mr. Bowers “used or possessed any firearm . . . in connection with

another felony offense; or possessed . . . any firearm . . . with knowledge, intent, or

reason to believe that it would be used or possessed in connection with another felony

offense.” U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6)(B). As best the Court can piece together the evidence,

including the contents of the DVD, Mr. Taylor, not Mr. Bowers, was the aggressor

and Mr. Taylor, not Mr. Bowers, had become suddenly vocal and angry. Mr. Bowers’

response was to place his hand on his holstered gun, but the Court is not convinced

he ever actually drew it. If Mr. Bowers intended to pull his firearm, Mr. Taylor’s

quickness in lunging with the wrench and swinging at Mr. Bowers did not allow him

time to do so. The one witness who might have been able to clear the fog about what

happened between the two men is Ms. Taylor, Mr. Taylor’s younger sister, who

bravely stood between the two men and attempted to play peacemaker. However,

neither the Government nor Mr. Bowers called Ms. Taylor as a witness. The Court

is left with evidence that is equivocal at best and does not sustain the Government’s

burden of proof. The Court declines to apply the four-level enhancement under

U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6)(B).

V.     OBSTRUCTING OR IMPEDING THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE

       UNDER U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1 7


7       The Court’s determination that Mr. Bowers is subject to the ACCA means he is subject to a
statutory mandatory minimum of fifteen years of imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. § 922(e)(1). It also affects

                                                19
            A.          Background

        Section 3C1.1 of the Guidelines states:

        If (1) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to
        obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the
        investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of
        conviction, and (2) the obstructive conduct related to (A) the defendant’s
        offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (B) a closely related
        offense, increase the offense level by 2 levels.

The Probation Office recommended application of this two-level enhancement. PSR

¶¶ 16, 24. In paragraph sixteen, the Probation Office stated that two witnesses

“reported to authorities that Bowers telephoned them on the evening of April 9, 2016”

and “asked the witnesses to delete the video footage recorded by the security camera

and to assert to authorities that the weapon recovered at the scene was Taylor’s gun.”

Id. ¶ 16. In exchange for their cooperation, Mr. Bowers told them that they could

“keep the gun.” Id. The Probation Office concluded that Mr. Bowers’ conversations

amounted to an attempt to unlawfully influence a witness or to get another person to

destroy or conceal evidence, justifying the obstruction of justice enhancement. Id.




his guideline calculations. U.S.S.G. § 4B1.4. Under the Probation Office’s calculations, for example,
but for the ACCA, Mr. Bowers would have had a total offense level of 21 and he would have been a
criminal history category of III. PSR ¶¶ 25, 27A-27B, 37. With a total offense level of 21 and a criminal
history category of III, the guideline range for imprisonment, but for the ACCA, would have been 46
to 57 months. However, § 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) jumps Mr. Bowers’ offense level to 34 because he possessed
a silencer and his criminal history category escalates to VI for the same reason. With acceptance of
responsibility, the resulting guideline sentence range is 188 to 235 months, PSR ¶ 63, and the Court
must impose a sentence of at least fifteen years. 18 U.S.C. § 922(e)(1).
        If the ACCA applies to Mr. Bowers’ case, there would be no practical need for the Court to
make the other guideline calculations because they are trumped by the statutory and guideline
provisions of the ACCA. Nevertheless, the Court is addressing these issues because it is possible that,
either before or after he is sentenced, the Supreme Court or the First Circuit will clarify whether the
ACCA should be applied to defendants like Mr. Bowers, and technically, the proper way to calculate
the guidelines is first to determine the guideline calculations without the Chapter Four enhancements
and then to determine the impact of the Chapter Four provisions on the resulting sentencing range.


                                                  20
      Mr. Bowers objects to the obstruction of justice enhancement and the

Government supports it. At the testimonial hearing, the Government produced the

testimony of Kara Cunningham. Tr. 62:25-73:5. Ms. Cunningham is Mr. Taylor’s

girlfriend and she also has a tangential relationship with Mr. Bowers as he is “the

brother to [her] cousin’s ex-husband.” Id. 63:2-16. The evening of the altercation at

Mr. Taylor’s garage, Ms. Cunningham testified that Mr. Bowers called her from the

hospital and asked her to say that the gun was Mr. Taylor’s, not his. Id. 66:2-6. She

replied that she would talk to Mr. Taylor and she ended the phone call. Id. 66:19-21.

      The Court declines to apply the obstruction of justice enhancement to Mr.

Bowers. The Court accepts Ms. Cunningham’s testimony and the facts in paragraph

sixteen of the PSR. Nevertheless, for the obstruction of justice enhancement to apply,

the Government must prove that Mr. Bowers acted “willfully.” U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1 (“If

(1) the defendant willfully obstructed . . . .”). Under First Circuit law, “willfulness

generally means that an act was undertaken with a ‘bad purpose,’ that is, with

knowledge that the act is unlawful.” United States v. Iwuala, 789 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir.

2015); see also United States v. Ramirez, 495 F. Supp. 2d 92, 115 (D. Me. 2007)

(quoting Bryan v. United States, 524 U.S. 184, 191-92 (1998)). The PSR reflects that

Mr. Bowers was knocked unconscious by Mr. Taylor, that he was taken to the hospital

for medical treatment, that he had no recollection of the events, that he suffered a

traumatic brain injury as a result of the altercation, that he also suffered vertigo,

hearing loss, and double vision, and that, although he did not sustain a skull fracture

or intracranial bleeding, he has been treated for post-concussive syndrome. PSR ¶¶



                                          21
8-9, 49. Mr. Bowers testified that he continues to suffer symptoms from the April 9,

2016 incident. Tr. 83:19-84:2. Absent more evidence about his state of mind during

the evening of April 9, 2016 while he was hospitalized, the Court does not conclude

that the Government sustained its burden to prove that Mr. Bowers had the requisite

“culpable state of mind” that evening to act in a willful manner. United States v.

Troisi, 849 F.3d 490, 494 (1st Cir. 2017).

VI.    ACCEPTANCE OF RESPONSIBILITY

        Under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1, a defendant is entitled to a two-level reduction in his

guideline calculations if he “clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility.”

U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(a). He is entitled to a further one-level reduction if the government

moves for it. 8 Id. § 3E1.1(b). Here, Mr. Bowers pleaded guilty to the offense of

conviction and there is no evidence that he falsely denied relevant conduct and

therefore ordinarily, he would be entitled to the three-level reduction. Id. Application

Note 3 (indicating that the entry of a plea of guilty prior to the commencement of trial

constitutes significant evidence of acceptance of responsibility for purposes of

subsection (a)). The Probation Office recommended that Mr. Bowers be granted a

three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. PSR ¶¶ 17, 27A-27.

       The Government objects based on the fact that Mr. Bowers was involved in a

fight with another inmate at Somerset County Jail on April 5, 2018. The Government

presented a DVD of an altercation on April 5, 2018, in the Somerset County Jail



8       The Court assumes that the Government will move for the third point under § 3E1.1(b) because
it is rare for it not to do so, where the Court has found a defendant is entitled to acceptance of
responsibility under § 3E1.1(a).

                                                22
between Mr. Bowers and another inmate, Gov’t’s Ex. 4, as well as ten pages of

investigative reports about the incident. Gov’t’s Ex. 5. The DVD shows Mr. Bowers

playing cards with three other inmates. Mr. Bowers is in a wheelchair. The inmate

to Mr. Bowers’ right stands up, Mr. Bowers wheels his wheelchair back, and the

inmate takes a swing at Mr. Bowers with his right fist. Mr. Bowers stands up from

the wheelchair and the two of them start to exchange blows, ultimately wrestling on

the floor, when corrections officers quickly emerge to separate the inmates and stop

the fight. After the corrections officers separate the inmates, Mr. Bowers continues

to lunge at the other inmate and has to be held back by the other officers.

      During his testimony, Mr. Bowers stated that he and Michael Pixley were

playing cards with two other inmates, when Mr. Pixley began talking about an

incident involving John Oliveira, Mr. Bowers’ cellmate. Tr. 79:11-80:4. According to

Mr. Bowers, Mr. Pixley said that he was going to beat up Mr. Oliveira because of the

incident. Id. 80:1-13. Mr. Bowers said he “tried to deflect it,” observing that Mr.

Pixley was going to get out soon and that the incident between Mr. Pixley and Mr.

Oliviera was minor. Id. 80:16-20. Mr. Bowers was not able to settle Mr. Pixley down

and Mr. Bowers told Mr. Pixley that it had “nothing [to] do with like being macho or

tough” and he thought Mr. Pixley misinterpreted the statement to challenge his

toughness. Id. 80:23-81:1. Mr. Pixley replied that he was tougher than most of the

people in the block and that he could beat up Mr. Bowers. Id. 81:1-4. Mr. Bowers

chuckled and said to Mr. Pixley that he did not need to threaten him and that Mr.

Pixley was not tougher than all the guys on the block, and Mr. Bowers motioned with



                                         23
his thumb toward the pod. Id. 81:4-19. Mr. Pixley did not react well, balled up his

fists, and told Mr. Bowers that he would “waste [him] right there.” Id. 81:20-82:1.

Mr. Bowers said that Mr. Pixley began cocking back to hit him, that Mr. Pixley threw

the first punch, and that Mr. Bowers did not want to sustain another head injury. Id.

82:21-83:2. In addition to the DVD and Mr. Bowers’ testimony, the Court reviewed

the incident report from the Somerset County Jail. Gov’t’s Ex. 5.

       If a defendant engages in unlawful conduct after his guilty plea, including an

assault, this may be grounds for denying acceptance of responsibility. United States

v. Stile, 845 F.3d 425, 428-32 (1st Cir. 2017); U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1, Application Note 1(B)

(“voluntary termination or withdrawal from criminal conduct or associations”). Here,

however, the DVD clearly demonstrates that Mr. Pixley, not Mr. Bowers, was the

person who instigated the fight. Mr. Pixley stood up and took a swing at Mr. Bowers’

head. Mr. Bowers responded by defending himself. The Government is correct that

Mr. Bowers continued to try and get at Mr. Pixley after a corrections officer was

attempting to hold him back. At least when Mr. Pixley stood up and took a swing at

Mr. Bowers, Mr. Bowers had no choice but to defend himself. Once Mr. Pixley and

Mr. Bowers began to fight, it is difficult to turn off the adrenaline and, although the

Court does not condone Mr. Bowers’ attempt to wiggle out of the corrections officer’s

grasp and get to Mr. Pixley, the Court declines to deny Mr. Bowers’ acceptance of

responsibility based on the unique circumstances of this altercation.

VII.   SUMMARY

   The Court resolves the sentencing issues as follows:



                                          24
   (1) The Court concludes that Mr. Bowers is subject to the statutory and guideline

      provisions of the ACCA and U.S.S.G. § 4B1.4;

   (2) The Court concludes that the Government has not sustained its burden to

      prove that Mr. Bowers used or possessed the firearm in connection with

      another felony offense under U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6)(B);

   (3) The Court concludes that the Government has not sustained its burden to

      prove that Mr. Bowers willfully obstructed justice under U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1; and

   (4) The Court concludes that Mr. Bowers has accepted responsibility for the

      offense and is entitled to a three-level reduction under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1.

The Court makes the following guideline calculations:

      (1) Base Offense Level: U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(a)(4)(B):                         20

      (2) Specific Offense Characteristic: U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(1)(A):            +2

      (3) Adjusted Offense Level:                                                22

      (4) Chapter Four Enhancement: U.S.S.G. § 4B1.4(b)(3)(A):                   34

      (5) Acceptance of Responsibility: U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(a), (b):                -3

      (6) Total Offense Level:                                                   31

Mr. Bowers’ criminal history score is III; however, under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.4(c)(1), his

criminal history score is elevated to VI. For a total offense level of 31 and a criminal

history score of VI, the applicable guideline range for imprisonment is 188 to 235

months, a fine range from $30,000 to $250,000, supervised release of two to five years,

and a special assessment of $100.




                                          25
      If the ACCA and § 4B1.4 did not apply, Mr. Bowers would face a very different

guideline calculation. His base offense level would be 20. He would receive a two-

level increase for the number of firearms for an adjusted offense level of 22. His

adjusted offense level would be reduced three levels to 19 for acceptance of

responsibility. His criminal history score would be III. For a total offense level of 19

and a criminal history score of III, the applicable guideline range would be 37 to 46

months. His fine range would be $10,000 to $100,000. The period of supervised

release would be one to three years. The special assessment would be $100.

      SO ORDERED.
