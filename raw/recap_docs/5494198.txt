GR UNDS FOR PEAL

12. Defendant Rivera believes that he is presently being held in violation of the
Constitution, laws and treaties of the United States.

(a). Specifically, Defendant Rivera believes that he was sentenced in violation of
Kimbrough and Gall insofar as the Guidelines are only one of the factors to be considered

when imposing a sentence .2 The Guidelines, as modified by Booker, instruct District Courts

  

to impose a sentence sufficient ) _ _ _ ' _ '_ _ ‘ _.'r;._".z.a , to achieve the goals of

 

sentencing (emphasis added).3

Post Booker, the Courts were directed to avoid unwarranted disparities among
defendants with similar records who have been convicted of similar criminal conduct Judges
are now directed to consider the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and
characteristics of the defendant4 The Court failed to properly classify Defendant under

Guideline § 3B l .l (c), thereby overlooking the allowable reduction had a two (2) level

enhancement been imposed Had the two (2) level enh_an_cement been im@sed, Defen@t
Rivera wog!d have been @wnced betwgn 70 and 87 months, as Qmsed m 78 and 97

months
Lastly, Defendant Rivera believes that his attorney inadequately represented him at

trial.

(b). lt is not known whether the attorney of record for Defendant Rivera made any
reference to the specific avenues of appeal Defendant Rivera believes that his attorney
inadequately represented him at trial.

13. Defendant Rivera believes that an argument for a fair and reasonable sentence was
never properly argued at time of sentencing Defendant Rivera believes that this was due to a
combination of his attomey’s ineffectiveness and Defenth Rivera’s inability to speak or
communicate in English. For the reasons set forth below, Defendant Rivera believes that he
received a sentence disproportional to the offense for which he was convicted.

Defendant Rivera requests that his offense level be reduced to represent a more
accurate reflection of the various offenses, thereby reducing his sentence accordingly. In
specific response, Defendant Rivera states the following:

(a). Defendant was sentenced under §2Dl.l (c)(6) for a base offense level of 28
under the presumption that the amount of heroin was at least 400 grams and no more than 700
grams.

(b). Defendant states that the base level oiTense was predicated on a non-agreed
quantity of illicit drugs. The sentence of eighty-eight (88) months, although within the level 3
enhancement guideline range, was higher than would have been imposed had Defendant been
properly classified with a level 2 enhancement Due to the mischaracterization, Defendant’s
sentence recommendation was for 78-97 months instead of 70-87 months. The imposed

sentence ofeighty-eight (88) months is, therefore, beyond the highest range for the actual

sentencing guideline

Case 1:04-cr-10336-N|\/|G Document 471 Filed 08/22/2008 Page 6 of 10

(c). Defendant was sentenced under Guideline § 3B1.1 (b) with a three (3) level
enhancement under the presumption that he was a manager or supervisor (as opposed to an
organizer or leader) and that the criminal activity involved five (5) or more participants or was
otherwise extensive ln fact, this Court acknowledged that Defendant was a Supervisor for but
one (l) or possibly two (2) others who were involved As such, the charges more accurately
reflect a two (2) level enhancement under Guideline § 3Bl .l (c), thereby allowing for a
reduction of the overall sentence irnposed.

(d). There is insuHicient information to determine the scope of Defendant’s role.
By this Court’s admission, Defendant acted in the capacity of a Supervisor of less than five (5)
others rather than as an Organizer/Leader or Manager of five (5) or more

As defined$, an Organizer/Leader “ organizer leads, directs, or otherwise runs a drug
distribution organization, has a largest share of the profits and the most decision making
authority”.

AManager “serves as a lieutenant to assist the OrganizerfLeader manages all or a
significant portion of a drug manufacturing importation or drug distribution operation; takes
instructions from the Organizer/leader and conveys to subordinates; supervises directly at
least one other co-participant in an organization of' at least five co-participants”.

Aquervr`sor “supervises at least one other co-participant but has limited authority
and does not qualify as a manager”.

(e). Under §3Bl.l(b), if Defendant was a manager or a supervisor (but not an

organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five (5) or more participants or was

otherwise extensive, the base offense will increase by 3 levels (emphasis added). Under
§3Bl .l (c), if Defendant was an organizer, leader, manager or supervisor in any criminal
activity other than previously described, the base offense will increase by 2 levels (emphasis
added).

(f). For purposes of this Motion, Defendant agrees with the adjustment for
acceptance of responsibility whereby a three (3) level reduction has been applied pursuant to
§3El.l (a) and (b). As such, Defendant’s current sentence is offense level 28 with 78 to 97
months to serve. In accordance, Defenth was sentenced to eighty-eight (88) months to
serve with four (4) years of supervised probation, considered at the higher side of the
sentencing guideline given his more limited involvement Pursuant to Kimbrough, Defendant
must be given a sentence no greater than necessary taking into consideration his acceptance of
responsibility and the Court recognized limited role he played. It must also be noted that
Defendant Rivera was sentenced to the higher side of the guidelines despite having no prior
criminal history points. Nor was Defendant found to have used violence, threats or weapons

in connection with the charged offenses

14. Defendant Rivera., through his attorney, filed an Appeal with the United States Court
of Appeals for the First Cireuit in the District of Massachusetts at the John J. Moakley United
States Courthouse located in Boston, Massachusetts under Docket No. 07-2181. '['he Appeal
was docketed on August l, 2007. The specific reasons cited for the Appeal were for the

conviction and sentencing

Attomey Carl N. Donaldson whose office address is 240 Commercial Street in Boston,

ln addition, Defendant Rivera was charged with Crirninal Forfeiture under 21 U.S.C. §

853.

l7. Defendant Rivera does not have any fixture sentence to serve after completion of the

present sentence for which he is seeking a reduction

18. This filing of this Motion was unfortunately delayed by Attomey Carl N. Donaldson’s
lack of action and failure to meet his responsibilities to the court and his client, as evidenced
by the Docket Report on file attire First Circuit Court of Appeals. ln addition, the filing was
delayed by the late filing of the trial transcript (trial transcript filed on 6/12/08 with the Court

having issued an ORDER to Show Cause on 5/13/08).

Defendant Rivera, with the assistance of Ciiminal Defense Consultants, LLC, for the
reasons articulated, seeks a downward adjustment of his sentencing score and offense level.
This is based on the overstating of Defendant’s original offense level and his presumed

propensity to commit firrther crimes.

WHEREFORE Defendant Rivera respectli.llly requests that this Court acknowledges

and considers sufficient but not greater than necessary, the statutory directives set forth in 18

Case 1:04-cr-10336-N|\/|G Document 471 Filed 08/22/2008 Page 10 of 10

U.S.C. § 3553 (a). Defendant suggests that the offenses more accurately fall within the
guideline range of level 27 and, therefore, requests that his sentence be reduced by a
maximum of eighteen (18) months. In consideration thereof, Defendant will agree to a longer
post-incarceration probation period contemporaneous with the sentence reduction In
addition, Defendant will immediately withdraw his appeal upon the implementation of a

reduced sentence

I declare (or certify, verify, or state) under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and

correct and that this Motion Under 28 U.S.C.§2255 was placed in the prison mailing system
