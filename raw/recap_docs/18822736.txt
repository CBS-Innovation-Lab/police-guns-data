                         THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                          FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO


 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
         Plaintiff,
         v.                                                  Crim. No. 05-277 (ADC)
 [1] LASHAUN J. CASEY
         Defendant.


                                    OPINION AND ORDER
I.     Procedural History
       In a superseding indictment released by the Grand Jury on February 14, 2007, Lashaun
Casey (“defendant”) was charged with the knowing, wilful, intentional and unlawful taking
of a motor vehicle by force and violence from a police officer with the intent to cause death
or serious bodily harm, resulting in the death of the police officer in violation of 18 U.S.C.
§2119(3) ECF No. 104. Defendant was also charged with the willful possession, brandishment,
discharge, use and carrying of firearms in relation to a crime of violence in violation of 18
U.S.C. §924(j). Id. Finally, defendant was charged as a felon in knowing possession of a
firearm (“the felon-in-possession charge”) in violation of 18 U.S.C. §922(g)(1).
       Pending before the Court is defendant’s motion for severance of Count Three, the felon-
in-possession charge, and defendant’s motion in limine to exclude materials relating to the
prior felony convictions as impermissible bad acts evidence under Federal Rules of Evidence
403 and 404(b) (“Rule 403" and “Rule 404(b)” respectively). ECF No. 485. The United States
opposed both the request for severance and the motion in limine. ECF No. 498.
II.    Severance of the Felon-in-Possession Count
       Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8(a) (“Rule 8(a)”), joinder of separate
offenses is proper where the offenses “are based on the same act or transaction, or are
connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.” Fed.R.Crim. P. 8(a); see also
United States v. Boulanger, 444 F.3d 76, 87 (1st Cir. 2006); United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 973

Criminal No. 05-277 (ADC)                                                                     Page 2


(1st Cir. 1995). In pertinent part, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 14 (“Rule 14") provides
that, “[i]f joinder of offenses . . . for trial appears to prejudice a defendant . . . , the court may
order separate trials of counts.” Fed.R.Crim. P. 14; see also United States v. Richardson, 515 F.3d
74, 81 (1st Cir. 2008). However, “[g]arden variety prejudice . . . will not . . . warrant
severance.” Richardson, 515 F.3d at 81 (citing United States v. Burgos, 254 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir.
2001)). Rather, severance is appropriate where the allegedly prejudicial joinder likely would
deprive the defendant of a fair trial. Id.
       In the instant case, joinder of the felon-in-possession count was patently appropriate
under Rule 8(a) because this count arose from the same conduct as the other charges filed. See
e.g. United States v. Turner, 501 F.3d 59, 72 (1st Cir. 2007) (finding that felon-in-possession
counts were properly joined with other counts where all counts arose from the same conduct).
Accordingly, finding that joinder of this count was proper, the Court must determine whether
severance due to prejudice is warranted under Rule 14.
       Here, defendant cites no particularized prejudice which he will suffer if the felon-in-
possession count is not severed. Rather, defendant relies upon his evidentiary argument
under Rules 403 and 404(b) that introduction of any evidence relating to his prior felony
convictions will result in the jury inferring guilt in the instant case. However, the First Circuit
Court of Appeals has already established that entry of evidence that defendant committed a
previous felony in support of a felon-in-possession charge is not per se sufficient to warrant
severance. See United States v. Rose, 104 F.3d 1408, 1416 (1st Cir. 1997); United States v.
Boulanger, 444 F.3d 76, 87-88 (1st Cir. 2006); Richardson, 515 F.3d at 81. The Court may, and
shall, undertake precautions, such as instructing the jury to consider each count as a separate
charged offense without allowing the verdict on one count to affect the other, to ensure that
any potential prejudice to defendant from the joinder is minimized. See Boulanger, 444 F.3d
at 88. Thus, in the absence of a showing that defendant would be more prejudiced than any
other defendant facing trial for a felon-in-possession count in addition to other counts,
       Case 3:05-cr-00277-ADC Document 757 Filed 12/20/12 Page 3 of 5



Criminal No. 05-277 (ADC)                                                                     Page 3


defendant’s request to sever Count Three is DENIED and the Court’s inquiry shall revolve
around the scope of evidence to be admitted in support of the felon-in-possession count.
III.   Motion In Limine Under Rules 403 and 404(b)
       A bastion of the Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 401 provides that “[e]vidence is
relevant if it has ‘any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the
determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the
evidence.’” United States v. Flemmi, 402 F.3d 79, 86 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Fed.R.Evid. 401).
Its corollary, Rule 402, provides that, generally, “[a]ll relevant evidence is admisible” and
“[e]vidence which is not relevant is not admissible.” Fed.R.Evid. 402.
       Further, even if evidence is deemed relevant under Rules 401 and 402, where a
defendant contests the admissibility of “bad act” evidence, a two-pronged test for
admissibility applies under Rule 404(b).1 See United States v. Sebaggala, 256 F.3d 59, 67 (1st Cir.
2001). First, the Court must evaluate “whether the evidence is specially probative of an issue
in the case and is not merely offered to show the defendant’s bad character or propensity for
crime.” United States v. Smith, 292 F.3d 90, 98-99 (1st Cir. 2002) (internal quotation omitted).
If the proffered evidence meets the strictures of this first prong, the Court must still evaluate
its admissibility under Rule 403.2 Id. at 99. Thus, even if the evidence meets Rule 404(b)’s


        1
         Rule 404(b) provides that:
               [e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the
               character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It
               may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive,
               opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence
               of mistake or accident, provided that upon request by the accused, the
               prosecution in a criminal case shall provide reasonable notice in advance
               of trial, or during trial if the court excuses pretrial notice on good cause
               shown, of the general nature of any such evidence it intends to introduce
               at trial.
Fed.R.Evid. 404(b).
        2
            Under Rule 403,
                [a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is
                substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of
      Case 3:05-cr-00277-ADC Document 757 Filed 12/20/12 Page 4 of 5



Criminal No. 05-277 (ADC)                                                                              Page 4


explicit requirements, it may still be inadmissible if its likely prejudicial impact substantially
outweighs its likely probative worth.” Sebaggala, 256 F.3d at 67.
        In order to prove a violation of 18 U.S.C. §921(g)(1), the United States “must show that
(1) the defendant was previously convicted of an offense requiring imprisonment exceeding
one year and (2) he knowingly possessed a firearm in or affecting interstate commerce.”
United States v. Lewis, 40 F.3d 1325, 1342 (1st Cir. 1994). Thus, evidence that defendant was
previously convicted of a crime which carried a penalty of an imprisonment greater than one
year in length is extremely relevant to the first element of the crime and does not fall within
the ambit of Rule 404(b)’s proscription against “bad acts” evidence. While the First Circuit has
thus affirmed the admission of evidence proving that defendant falls within the category of
“felons” contemplated by the statute, it has emphasized that proof of this element does not
extend to allow admission of evidence as to the nature of the prior conviction. Lewis, 40 F.3d
at 1342-43; United States v. Melvin, 27 F.3d 703, 707 (1st Cir. 1994); United States v. Tavares, 21
F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1994). Absent special circumstances not present in the instant case,
evidence beyond the fact that a defendant was convicted of an unspecified felony is thus
excludable under Rule 403. Melvin, 27 F.3d at 707. Accordingly, inasmuch as defendant’s
motion seeks to exclude3 evidence relating to the nature of the predicate crimes, it is
GRANTED. However, the United States must still be allowed to prove that defendant is a
felon within the meaning of the felon-in-possession statute. The United States shall be allowed
to present evidence supporting its assertion that defendant is a felon and defendant’s motion
in limine as to this evidence is DENIED; however, this evidence must be redacted to remove


               the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay,
               waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.
Fed.R.Evid. 403.
        3
          The Court’s analysis in the instant Opinion and Order pertains solely to the guilt phase and does not
extend to the penalty phase, where the United States seeks to admit evidence relating to defendant’s previous
convictions for purposes which are distinct from those contemplated here.

any reference to the nature of the underlying predicate crimes.4
IV.     Conclusion
        For the reasons set forth above, defendant’s motion (ECF No. 485) is GRANTED IN
PART AND DENIED IN PART.




IT IS SO ORDERED.
        In San Juan, Puerto Rico, on this 20th day of December, 2012.

           This status may be proved in several ways without including prejudicial information, including by
stipulation. E.g. Tavares, 21 F.3d at 4 (noting that such methods include “a redacted record, testimony by a clerk,
stipulation, a defendant’s affidavit, or even, in the absence of controversy, judicial notice of the prior
conviction”).
