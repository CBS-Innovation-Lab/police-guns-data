WILLIAM E. SMITH, United States District Judge.

     Waskar   Pena      has    filed   a    motion   in   the        above   matter

requesting this Court to vacate that portion of his criminal

Judgment which imposed a $50,000 fine and to reimpose a lesser

fine, along with an appropriate payment schedule, based on his

current financial status.1          For the reasons hereinafter stated,

the motion is denied.

I.   Background

     On April 5, 2006, Pena pleaded guilty to three felony drug

offenses2   and   was    sentenced     in    this    Court3     to     151   months




     1
       The motion is entitled “Petitioner Waskar Pena’s Request
To Vacate Fine and To Make a Payment Schedule after Considering
Petitioner’s Financial Circumstances” (ECF No. 197) (hereinafter
“Motion to Vacate or Reduce Fine”).
     2
       The specific offenses were: (1) conspiracy to possess 500
grams or more of cocaine, with intent to distribute it, in
violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846; (2) possession of 500 grams or
more of cocaine with intent to distribute it in violation of 21
U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B); and (3) possession of 100
grams or more of heroin with intent to distribute it, in
violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B).
imprisonment,    followed   by    eight   years   of   supervised   release.

(See J. 2-3, July 28, 2006, ECF No. 97.)           After noting that Pena

had not submitted any financial statement and, after considering

the Presentence Report (PSR), which referred to a credit report

showing that Pena owned encumbered real estate, the sentencing

Court also imposed a $50,000 fine.         (See Sentencing Tr. 37, July

14, 2006 (“Sent. Tr.”).)         The fine was payable immediately, in

one lump sum.     (J. 6.)        Throughout all proceedings leading to

his conviction, Pena was represented by retained counsel John J.

Bevilacqua.

     Pena filed an appeal but then voluntarily withdrew it; the

appeal was dismissed on November 28, 2006.             See United States v.

Pena, No. 06-2171, slip op. (1st Cir. Nov. 28, 2006).                   His

subsequent motion to reinstate the appeal was denied by the

First Circuit.     See id., slip op., Jan. 15, 2008.            Thereafter,

Pena filed a motion to vacate judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §

2255 on March 3, 2008.           That motion was denied by this Court

(Torres, J.) as untimely filed.           (See Mem. & Order, Jan. 23,

2009, ECF No. 172.)    Pena did not raise any issue as to his fine

in either his direct appeal or his motion to vacate.

     Pena next filed a motion for return of funds that had been

seized incident to his arrest and prosecution.             That motion was


     3
        All criminal proceedings in this Court, including
sentencing, were conducted before Chief Judge Ernest C. Torres.
This matter was transferred to the undersigned in March 2009.

                                      2
denied by Magistrate Judge Lincoln Almond on November 4, 2009.

(See Mem. & Order, Nov. 4, 2009, ECF No. 190.)

      On June 14, 2010, Pena filed the instant motion, seeking a

reduction or elimination of his fine on the basis of his present

inability to satisfy the obligation.            As ordered by this Court,

the government has filed an objection, to which Pena has filed a

reply.4   This matter is ready for decision.5

II.   Discussion

      In his motion, Pena seeks a reduction or remission of his

fine because he is currently indigent and is unable to pay.

Pena argues that at sentencing the government did not recommend

a fine in view of the fact that he had eight children; that the

sentencing court did not take his financial circumstances into

consideration      when   imposing    this   fine;   and   that   his   current

prison    income     is   $13   per    month,    plus      whatever     monetary

assistance his family can give him.              Pena asks this Court to

vacate the fine and to reimpose a lesser fine and a realistic

Order Payment Schedule, ECF No. 202 (“Gov’t Mem.”), and
Petitioner’s Reply to the Gov’t’s Opp., ECF No. 207 (“Reply”).
      5
       No hearing on this motion is necessary.      See David v.
United States, 134 F.3d 470, 477 (1st Cir. 1998) (district court
properly may forego any hearing “when (1) the motion is
inadequate on its face, or (2) the movant's allegations, even if
true, do not entitle him to relief, or (3) the movant's
allegations need not be accepted as true because they state
conclusions instead of facts, contradict the record, or are
inherently   incredible”)  (internal  quotations   and   citation
omitted).

payment schedule based on his current small income.                 (Mot. at

¶¶ 12-15; Reply at ¶ 27.)

       The short answer to Pena’s request is that this Court is

unable to provide the relief he seeks.             Title 18 U.S.C. § 3573

provides the mechanism for modifying or remitting a fine imposed

as part of a criminal sentence.            Pursuant to § 3573, only the

Government may petition to remit or reduce a fine imposed as

part   of   a   criminal   sentence.       See,   e.g.,   United   States   v.

Gonzalez, 248 F.3d 1128, at *1 (1st Cir. 2000) (Table) (district

court lacked jurisdiction to act on defendant’s postconviction

request to remit fine); United States v. Linker, 920 F.2d 1, 2

(7th Cir. 1990); United States v. Schilling, 808 F. Supp. 1214,

1219 (E.D. Pa. 1992) (despite probation office's recommendation

that $25,000 fine be remitted to $2,500, “under current section

3573 defendants do not have the right to petition the courts to

remit their criminal fines”); United States v. Heimbach, 808 F.

Supp. 413, 416 (E.D. Pa. 1992) (same).            Likewise, Fed. R. Crim.

P. 35 does not provide a vehicle for Pena to seek the reduction

of his fine.      See Gonzalez, 248 F.3d 1128, at *1.              Thus, this

Court has no jurisdiction to hear the instant motion.

       Even if this Court could entertain Pena’s motion, it is

futile.     As the First Circuit has noted, “the defendant bears

the burden of proving both a current and future inability to pay

the fine.”      United States v. Manjarrez, 306 F.3d 1175, 1181 (1st

Cir. 2002) (citing United States v. Rowe, 268 F.3d 34, 38 (1st
                                       4
Cir. 2001)); see also U.S.S.G. § 5E1.2(a) (stating that a court

“shall impose a fine in all cases, except where the defendant

establishes that he is unable to pay and is not likely to become

able to pay any fine”).       Here, Pena did not present a financial

statement   and   otherwise   failed    to    make     any   presentation   at

sentencing concerning his ability to pay a fine.6

     Moreover,     Pena   does    not        contest     the    government’s

representations that he has participated in the Inmate Financial

Responsibility Program while incarcerated, and he acknowledges

that he has been making monthly payments towards his fine.              (See

Pena’s Decl. p. 2, ¶ 10, ECF No. 197.)            He has shown no reason

why he cannot continue in that program.7


     6
       Pena’s contention that his counsel failed to file a
financial statement on Pena’s behalf, due to a scheme under
which Pena (or his family) paid monies to counsel in exchange
for counsel’s promise that Pena “would be removed from prison
[based] on information [that his employee Lisa] Torres would
provide to federal prosecutors through [A]ttorney Bevilacqua”
(Reply 3), does not warrant relief. This ineffective assistance
claim was previously raised in connection with Pena’s § 2255
motion to vacate, which this Court (Torres J.) denied as
untimely filed and thus may not be reiterated here.   Moreover,
it appears that, in making these allegations, Pena is confusing
his counsel, John J. Bevilacqua, with a former Rhode Island
attorney, Joseph A. Bevilacqua, Jr., who was subsequently
convicted of a scheme substantially identical to that described
above.
     7
        Pena’s argument that the sentencing Court improperly
delegated its authority to allow the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to
make the payment schedule in this case (Reply ¶¶ 24-26) likewise
misses the mark. Nearly all of the cases cited by Pena involved
orders of restitution under the Mandatory Victim Restitution
Act; no restitution order is involved here, only a fine.
Further, the Judgment specified without elaboration that Pena’s
fine be paid immediately, and the fact that during his
                                5
III. Conclusion

      For all of the foregoing reasons, Pena’s Motion to Vacate

or Reduce Fine is hereby DENIED and DISMISSED.8


IT IS SO ORDERED.

incarceration, payments were made under the Inmate Financial
Responsibility Program (“IFRP”) does not provide grounds for
vacating and re-imposing a lesser fine.     See Bramson v. Winn,
136 Fed. Appx. 380, *1 (1st Cir. 2005) (where sentencing court
provided that payment of imposed fine was due immediately, there
was no improper delegation of court’s authority to impose a
payment schedule, even where BOP used the IFRP to collect
payments on the fine while defendant was incarcerated (citing
Matheny v. Morrison, 307 F.3d 709, 712 (8th Cir. 2002) (holding
that BOP may administer collection of payments through IFRP
where sentencing court orders immediate payment))).
      8
       The Court takes no position on any motion the government
might bring, if it deems appropriate, to reduce the fine under
18 U.S.C. § 3573.    The Court further notes that, upon release
from prison, Pena is to be surrendered to a duly-authorized
immigration official for deportation proceedings. (See J. 4.)
