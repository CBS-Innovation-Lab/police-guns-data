                    UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                       DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

            v.                                Case No. 08-cr-119-02-SM

Carlos Marsach



                                     ORDER

      Defendant's motion to continue the trial for ninety days (document no. 44) is

granted. Trial has been rescheduled for the January trial period. Defendant shall file

a Waiver of Speedy Trial Rights not later than October 26, 2009. On the filing of such

waiver, his continuance shall be effective.

      The court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C.

ยง 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would unreasonably deny

the defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective preparation taking into

account the exercise of due diligence under the circumstances.
