                 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                   FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

     Plaintiff,

v.                                   Criminal No. 11-460 (FAB)

CANDIDO O. APONTE-VELLON,

     Defendant.


                         MEMORANDUM AND ORDER

BESOSA, District Judge.

     Before the Court is the “motion for appropriate relief” of

defendant Candido O. Aponte-Vellon (“defendant Aponte”), (Docket

No. 143).     The motion states that on the eve of sentencing,

defendant Aponte “insisted [to his counsel] that he wants to

withdraw his plea of guilty.”     Id. at p. 2.    His counsel now seeks

to withdraw, indicating that a conflict of interest exists due to

his belief that defendant Aponte’s guilty plea “was voluntary and

intelligent.”    Id. at p. 2.    This is not the first time defendant

Aponte has made such a request; over the course of this case, he

has filed three motions for ineffective assistance of counsel, all

of which the Court denied.      (Docket Nos. 96, 107, 138.)

     The Court views defendant Aponte’s last minute maneuver of

seeking to change counsel as “a desperate attempt to game the

system.”    See United States v. Maldonado, No. 12-1012, at 5 (1st

Cir. 2013).     The First Circuit Court of Appeals has held that a
        Case 3:11-cr-00460-FAB Document 144 Filed 02/14/13 Page 2 of 6



Criminal No. 11-460 (FAB)                                                  2

criminal defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to retain counsel of

one’s choosing is not absolute: “[U]ltimately, a defendant’s right

to select his own counsel ‘cannot be insisted upon in a manner that

will obstruct reasonable and orderly court procedure.’” Maldonado,

No. 12-1012, at 9 (1st Cir. 2013) (citing United States v. Neal, 36

F.3d 1190, 1206–06 (1st Cir. 1994).         Because the Court finds that

defendant Aponte’s motion for appropriate relief is “nothing but

obstructionism” designed to give him a second bite at the apple, it

DENIES his motion.       See Maldonado, No. 12-1012, at 11.

     As the magistrate judge twice found, defendant Aponte entered

into his plea agreement knowingly and voluntarily.             On September

19, 2012, he appeared at his change of plea hearing and was

provided with a Waiver of Right to Trial by Jury, which he signed

and agreed upon voluntarily after examination in open court, under

oath.   (Docket No. 102 at p. 2.)        Defendant Aponte indicated and

confirmed his intention to plead guilty to Counts One and Two of

the Superseding Indictment. Id. The magistrate judge was able “to

ascertain his capacity and ability to understand, answer[,] and

comprehend the interactive colloquy with the magistrate judge” and

determined that defendant Aponte was competent and had the ability

to understand the proceedings by questioning him about his age,

education,    use   of    medication,   drugs,    alcohol,   or   substance

dependency, and psychological or psychiatric condition.             Id.   At

the change of plea hearing, defendant Aponte also verified that he

Criminal No. 11-460 (FAB)                                                                     3

had consulted with his counsel, Assistant Federal Public Defender,

Carlos A. Vazquez-Alvarez, prior to the hearing for change of plea

and confirmed that he “was satisfied with the services provided by

his legal representative and had time to discuss with him all

aspects      of    the    case    .     .   .   .”     Id.     He    also     provided      “an

individualized           and   positive         acknowledgment       of    each   and   every

waiver,” and “indicated he freely and voluntarily waived those

rights and understood the consequences.”                       Id. at p. 3.

       The magistrate judge again found defendant Aponte to have made

his    plea       knowingly      and    willingly      after     conducting       a    hearing

regarding his motion for ineffective assistance of counsel on

January 24, 2013.              At that hearing, defendant Aponte was placed

under oath and indicated that he wished to withdraw his guilty plea

“because the plea[] for nine (9) years of imprisonment [is] not

fair.”       (Docket No. 135 at p. 7.)                  He also sought new counsel

because he felt that his attorney “has not been effective and he

has lost confidence in his counsel.”                           Id.        In a report and

recommendation           issued        to    this    Court,    the        magistrate     judge

reiterated her previous finding that “there were no signs during

the change of plea hearings which alerted the undersigned that

defendants were not entering their pleas knowingly, voluntarily and

intelligently . . . . Moreover, we harbor no doubt that AFPD

Vazquez . . . ha[s] effectively represented [his] client[].”                                Id.

at    p.    12.      Nonetheless,           given    defendant    Aponte’s        feeling    of

Criminal No. 11-460 (FAB)                                                   4

discomfort with his counsel, and defendant Aponte’s counsel’s lack

of desire to continue representing his client due to a conflict of

interest, the magistrate judge recommended the appointment of new

counsel.     Id. at p. 13.

        The Court subsequently disagreed with the magistrate judge

that new counsel was warranted, finding the representation of

defendant Aponte’s lawyer to be “not just adequate, but exemplary,

considering the nature of the allegations in the indictment, the

sentence[] to which the defendant[] [was] exposed[,] and the terms

of the plea agreement[].”        (Docket No. 138 at pp. 3—4.)       It noted

that the AUSA prosecuting the case also detailed defense counsel’s

successful efforts to negotiate pleas of nine years imprisonment

after the initial plea offers were for 18 years, and that “she was

adamant     that   even   if   substitute   counsel   were   appointed    for

defendants, there would not be any more plea negotiations.” Id. at

p. 4.    Accordingly, the Court found “no reason” to change counsel.

Id.     It reaffirms those findings today.

        Pursuant to Local Rule 162(b), “no attorney may withdraw an

appearance in any action pending except by leave of Court.”               The

Court declines to extend that leave to defendant Aponte’s counsel

on the date of sentencing.          The magistrate judge indicated that

defendant Aponte’s motion “raises a panoply of arguments which are

not in tune with the proceedings in this case.”          (Docket No. 135 at

p. 6.)      The Court agrees, and finds defendant Aponte’s renewed
         Case 3:11-cr-00460-FAB Document 144 Filed 02/14/13 Page 5 of 6



Criminal No. 11-460 (FAB)                                                                 5

attempted       firing of      counsel      to    be    a “subterfuge      intended     to

undermine these proceedings.”               See United States v. Maldonado, No.

12-1012 at 5 (1st Cir. 2013).            It is clear that defendant Aponte is

not pleased with the term of incarceration to which he agreed in

his   plea      agreement.      He     must      live    today,      however,    with   the

consequences he acknowledged at his change of plea hearing, and not

take “a defiant stance, pulling out all the stops to jam-up the

proceedings.”       See Maldonado, No. 12-1012 at 11.                   Because he made

his guilty plea knowingly and voluntarily, and because the Court

regards defense counsel’s representation to be effective, if not

exemplary, defendant Aponte may not now seek new counsel or to

withdraw his guilty plea.

      As did the trial court in Maldonado, this Court finds that

defendant Aponte’s motion is not a sincere dismissal, that the

record     is    now    replete      with     examples        of   defendant     Aponte’s

resistance,       and   that    such     conduct        has   been    designed    towards

obstruction.        The Court finds no reason to grant a sentencing

continuance to change counsel, especially given the AUSA’s caution

that no more plea negotiations would take place even if substitute

counsel were appointed.                Accordingly, defendant’s motion “for

appropriate relief,” (Docket No. 143), is DENIED, and the Court

orders the sentencing to go forward at 9:00 AM on February 14,

2013.
