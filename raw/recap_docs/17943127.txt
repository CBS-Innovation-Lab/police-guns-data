               ORDER AFFIRMING RECOMMENDED DECISION
                      OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE


      On August 25, 2014, the United States Magistrate Judge filed with the

court, with copies to the parties, his Recommended Decision on Rule 60(b)

Motion. On September 9, 2014, the U.S. Postal Service returned to the Clerk’s

Office the copy mailed to the defendant marked “Return to Sender/

Refused/Unable to Forward” because of an incorrect inmate number in the

address. The copy was then re-mailed to the defendant with the correct inmate

number.    No objections have been filed.      The Magistrate Judge notified the

parties that failure to object would waive their right to de novo review and appeal.

      I have reviewed and considered the Recommended Decision, together with

the entire record; I have made a de novo determination of all matters adjudicated

by the Recommended Decision; and I concur with the recommendations of the

United States Magistrate Judge for the reasons set forth in the Recommended

Decision, and determine that no further proceeding is necessary.
      It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the Magistrate

Judge is hereby ADOPTED.         The defendant’s motion is DENIED without an

evidentiary hearing.

      I find that no certificate of appealability shall issue in the event the movant

files a notice of appeal because there is no substantial showing of the denial of

a constitutional right within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).

      SO ORDERED.

      DATED THIS 24TH   DAY OF   SEPTEMBER, 2014
