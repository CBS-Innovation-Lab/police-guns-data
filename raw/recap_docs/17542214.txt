                              ORDER

WILLIAM E. SMITH, United States District Judge.

     Defendant has moved for a new trial pursuant to Fed. R.

Crim. P. 33; for the disclosure of court personnel who attended

Defendant’s trial on February 24-26, 2011; and, pursuant to Fed.

R. Crim. P. 15, for leave to depose all witnesses revealed by

his motion for disclosure.

     Fed. R. Crim. P. 47(b) requires that a motion “state the

grounds on which it is based and the relief or order sought.”

Moreover, the local rules of this district provide that,

     “[e]very motion shall bear a title identifying the party
     filing it and stating the precise nature of the motion. In
     addition, every motion . . . shall contain a short and
     plain description of the requested relief and shall be
     accompanied by a separate memorandum of law setting forth
     the reasons why the relief requested should be granted and
     any applicable points and authorities supporting the
     motion.

DRI LR Cr 47(a).
        Defendant’s motion lists four grounds as the basis for a

new    trial,   but     it    does   not     set    forth   the    relevant     factual

discussion and legal authority needed to support his request.

As such, Defendant’s motion does not provide the specificity

needed to allow the Government to respond meaningfully or to

allow    the    Court    to    fairly      assess     its    merits.      Accordingly,

Defendant’s motion for a new trial is denied without prejudice.

        Similarly,      Defendant’s        motion    for    disclosure      requesting

“the    names   of     the    personnel      who    attended      the   trial   of    the

defendant,      Jose    Maldonado,      on    February      24-26,      2011”   and   his

motion to depose those personnel fail to state upon what grounds

Defendant is entitled to such relief.                   As such, this motion is

denied with prejudice.



IT IS SO ORDERED:
