UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

V. C.R. NO. 08-02T

FELIPE ARIAS
a/k/a Angel Deleon
MEMCRANDUM AND ORDER

Felipe Arias has been charged with possessing a firearm after
having been convicted of a felony in violation of 18 U.S.C.
922(g)(1). Arias has moved to suppress the firearm which was
seized, during the course of a traffic stop, from a motor vehicle
in which he was riding as a passenger.

The issue presented is whether police had sufficient cause to
stop and search the vehicle. Because this Court finds that they
did not have sufficient cause to stop the vehicle, the motion to
suppress is granted.

E§QL§

After conducting an evidentiary hearing, this Court finds the
relevant facts to be as follows.

Shortly before 9:00 p.m. on November 27, 2007, Patrolman
Charles T. Vieira of the Providence Police Department was driving
his patrol car in a westerly direction on Reynolds Avenue in what

l

Case 1:08-cr-00002-T-LDA Document 19 Filed 11/21/08 Page 2 of 11 Page|D #: 88

he referred to as a “high crime” area in the City of Providence.
Officer Vieira observed a white Subaru wagon traveling in the
opposite direction and coming toward him. After turning around in
a driveway, the Subaru, still some distance ahead of Officer
Vieira's patrol car, reversed direction and, also, began heading
west on Reynolds.

Officer Vieira followed the Subaru as it turned left onto
Ocean Street and he observed that it was occupied by three males.
He checked the Subaru's license plate through his onboard computer
and learned that it was registered to a Douglas Sosa-Nelson and
that it had not been reported as stolen. Officer Vieira, then,
stopped the Subaru and shined. his patrol car's spotlight and
rooftop “take-down” lights on it.

As Officer Vieira left his patrol car he saw Arias, the front
seat passenger, lean forward. When Officer Vieira shouted to the
occupants to show their hands, the driver and rear seat passenger
did so but Arias did not. As Officer Vieira approached the Subaru,
he called for backup and shined his flashlight into the car which
enabled him to see Arias shoving what appeared to be a chrome
object into the door panel and he heard a banging noise emanating
from the door which sounded “like metal on metal.”

When two backup officers arrived, the occupants, all young
Hispanic men, were removed from the Subaru and “patted down.” As

Arias stepped out of the Subaru, two batting gloves fell from his

lap onto the ground. Officer Vieira then looked into a stereo
speaker opening in the front passenger door where he saw a chrome
pistol that was discovered to have an erased serial number and to
contain a magazine with several live rounds.

Arias has moved to suppress the firearm on the grounds that
Officer Vieira lacked probable cause to stop or search the Subaru,
The Applicable Law

A traffic stop is a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth
Amendment and, therefore, it must be reasonable under the
circumstances in order to pass constitutional muster. Whren v.
United StateS, 517 U.S. 806, 810, ll6 S.Ct. 1769, 1772, 135 L.Ed.
2d 89 (1996); United States v. Chhien, 266 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.
2001)(A traffic stop “constitutes a seizure within the purview of
the Fourth Amendment . . . [and] must be reasonable under the
circumstances”). Moreover, as in the case of any warrantless
search or seizure, the burden is on the government to establish
that the stop was reasonable. United States v. Hawkins, 249 F.3d
867, 872 (9th Cir. 2001).

A brief investigatory traffic stop does not violate the Fourth
Amendment if police have a reasonable, articulable suspicion, based
on objective facts, that the occupants of the vehicle are engaged
in criminal activity, or if they have probable cause to believe
that a traffic violation has been committed. United States v.

Chhien, 266 F.3d at 6 (A traffic stop “must be supported by a

Case 1:08-cr-00002-T-LDA Document 19 Filed 11/21/08 Page 4 of 11 Page|D #: 90

reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity”)(citing
Berkemer v. McCarthy, 468 U.S. 420, 439, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 82 L.
Ed.2d 317 (1984)); United States v. Harris, 526 F.3d 1334, 1337-38
(11th Cir. 2008)(A traffic stop is constitutional “if it is either
based. upon. probable cause to believe a traffic violation. has
occurred or justified by reasonable suspicion in accordance with
I§;Ly, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S. Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889"); United
States v. Stachowiak, 521 F.3d 852, 855 (8th Cir. 2008)(“[O]fficer
must have ‘at least articulable and reasonable suspicion' of
illegal activity to stop a lnotor ‘vehicle”); United States v.
Wright, 512 F.3d 466, 471 (8th Cir. 2008)(A traffic stop is
reasonable “‘where the police have probable cause to believe that

a traffic violation has occurred'”)(citing to Whren, 517 U.S. at

 

810, 116 S.Ct. 1769).

When officers have probable cause to believe that a traffic
violation has occurred, a vehicle stop is not rendered
unconstitutional merely because they were mistaken as to the facts,
United States V. Jenkins, 452 F.3d 207, 212 (2d Cir. 2006). §§§,
United States V. MCDOnald, 453 F.3d 958, 961-62 (7th Cir. 2006)
(While a reasonable mistake of fact may justify a traffic stop, a
mistake of law cannot). Nor is a vehicle stop rendered
unconstitutional simply because the violation was a pretext for
seeking to obtain evidence of suspected criminal activity. United

States V. RObinSOn, 414 U.S. 218, 221 n.l, 94 S.Ct. 467,470 n.l, 38

Case 1:08-cr-00002-T-LDA Document 19 Filed 11/21/08 Page 5 of 11 Page|D #: 91

L.Ed.2d 427 (1973)(A traffic stop is not rendered invalid by the
fact that it was “a mere pretext for a narcotics search”); United
States v. Thomas, 93 F.3d 479, 485 (8th Cir. 1996)(“[T]he stop is
valid even if the police would have ignored the traffic violation
but for their suspicion that greater crimes are afoot”). The
relevant inquiry is whether the stop was objectively reasonable and
not what the officer’s subjective intent was. Whren v. United
States, 517 at 813, 116 S.Ct. at 1774 (confirming that
“‘[s]ubjective intent alone . . . does not make otherwise lawful
conduct illegal or unconstitutional'”)(internal citation omitted).

The determination as to whether a traffic stop was reasonable
must be based on the totality of the circumstances as they existed
at the time of the stop. United States v. Arvizu, 534 U.S. 266,
122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002); United States v. Walker,
924 F.2d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir. 1991). A stop that is unlawful at its
inception is not made lawful by the fact that it leads to the
discovery of evidence of criminal activity. United States v.
Kimball, 25 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1994)(holding that a search must be
justified by reasonable suspicion at the inception of the
intrusion). While presence in a “high crime area” is a relevant
consideration, it is not sufficient, by itself, to support the
stop. Illinois v. Wardlow, 528 U.S. 119, 124, 120 S. Ct. 673, 676,

145 L. Ed.2d 570 (2000).

The Arias Search

In this case, Officer Vieira mentioned, in passing, that the
Subaru was traveling in a “high crime area” but the government
offered no other evidence that, prior to the stop, he had reason to
believe that the occupants were engaged in any criminal activity.
Rather, the government sought to justify the stop on the ground
that a traffic violation. had. been committed. 'Therefore, the
threshold question is whether the government has presented credible
evidence that Officer Vieira had probable cause, based on objective
facts, to believe that a traffic violation had been committed.

Officer Vieira testified that, when the Subaru turned around
on Reynolds Avenue, he noticed that the left rear tail light,
including the signal light, was “smashed out” and could not have
been operable. That testimony was consistent with the incident
report that Officer Vieira filed in which he stated that the Subaru
was “operating with a broken rear tail light.” It also is
consistent with the fact that, at the scene, the driver of the
Subaru was issued a citation for driving with a broken tail light
but it is at odds with the testimony of several other witnesses.

In any event, Officer Vieira further testified that he stopped
the Subaru because the driver failed to signal before making a left
turn onto Ocean Street, something that was not mentioned in his
report or in the citation issued to the driver. On cross-

examination, Officer Vieira acknowledged that, a few days before

Case 1:08-cr-00002-T-LDA Document 19 Filed 11/21/08 Page 7 of 11 Page|D #: 93

the suppression hearing, he learned from an Assistant United States
Attorney that operating a vehicle with a broken tail light, by
itself, is not a violation of Rhode Island’s traffic laws.

Arias, then, presented convincing evidence that the Subaru's
left rear tail light was not damaged in any way. Betty
Palmisciano, the office manager at Dean Auto Collision Center
(“Dean Auto”), where the Subaru was taken from the scene, testified
that, when the vehicle arrived, there was no damage to the left
rear tail light and no work was done on it during the approximately
two months that it remained on Dean Auto's lot. Kevin Horning, a
Dean. Auto employee who purchased the Subaru after the owner
relinquished any claim to it, corroborated Palmisciano's testimony
and added that the left rear signal light was fully functional.
Daniel Fortier, a private investigator hired by defense counsel,
who examined the vehicle in March 2008, also testified that he
observed no damage to the left rear tail light and he produced
photographs confirming his observations.

Since driving with a knoken tail light is not a traffic
violation, the fact that Officer Vieira was, at least, mistaken in
stating that the Subaru's tail light was smashed is not material as
to whether he had sufficient legal justification for stopping the
Subaru. However, it is relevant on the issue of whether foicer
Vieira had probable cause to believe that the Subaru had failed to

give a turn signal.

Case 1:08-cr-00002-T-LDA Document 19 Filed 11/21/08 Page 8 of 11 Page|D #: 94

There are several reasons why this Court cannot accept the
contention that the Subaru was stopped because its driver failed to
give a turn signal. First, Officer Vieira appeared to base his
testimony, at least in part, not on what he actually observed but,
rather, on the erroneous premise that the Subaru's tail light was
smashed and the assumption that, therefore, it could not have
signaled. Moreover, the reliability of his testimony that the
Subaru failed to signal is undermined by the fact that he was
plainly incorrect in stating that the vehicle's tail light was
smashed. In addition, the failure to signal was not mentioned in
Officer Vieira's report and his testimony about the alleged failure
came after he had been informed that driving with a smashed tail
light was not a traffic violation. Finally, the driver of the
Subaru was cited for driving with a broken tail light, and not for
failing to signal.

It seems clear that Arias and his companions were engaged in
or were contemplating criminal activity that was likely to result
in death or serious injury and that, by stopping the Subaru,
Officer Vieira prevented that from happening. There is no other
plausible explanation of the fact that Arias possessed a loaded
pistol with an obliterated serial number and, apparently, was
wearing' gloves so that he would. leave no fingerprints on the
weapon. Accordingly, it is difficult to accept the notion that

evidence important to the case against Arias should be suppressed.

Case 1:08-cr-00002-T-LDA Document 19 Filed 11/21/08 Page 9 of 11 Page|D #: 95

However, the issue raised by Arias's motion to suppress is
whether the firearm was seized pursuant to a lawful search. A
warrantless search made without probable cause does not pass muster
under the Fourth Amendment on the ground that, in fact, it turned
up evidence of criminal activity. Bailey v. United States, 389
F.2d 305, 308 (C.A.D.C. 1967) (Discovery of evidence does not
validate a search that was not legitimate at its beginning).
Reasonable grounds for believing that criminal activity is afoot
must exist before the search is conducted. United States v.
Sowers, 136 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S.
841, 119 S. Ct. 105, 142 L.Ed.2d 84 (1998)(Court must determine
“whether the officer’s actions were justified at the
inception”)(Emphasis added); Bailey v. United States, 389 F.2d at
308 (holding that “there must be probable cause before the search
begins, for ‘a search is not to be made legal by what it turns
up.’”)(quoting United States v. DiRe, 332 U.S. 581, 595, 68 S. Ct.
222, 229, 92 L.Ed. 210 (1948)).

In this case, it is possible that there were facts or
circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that the
occupants of the Subaru were engaged in criminal activity but, no
such facts or circumstances were related. If such facts or
circumstances existed, the failure to relate them might have been
attributable to concerns that, while they signaled to an

experienced police officer who “knew the territory” that criminal

Case 1:08-cr-00002-T-LDA Document 19 Filed 11/21/08 Page 10 of 11 Page|D #: 96

activity was afoot, they were difficult to articulate and/or their
significance might not have been fully 'understood. by a court
considering them in the sterile atmosphere of the courtroom. The
failure also might be attributable to concerns that the reasons
might be misconstrued as some form of bias or prejudice.1 However,
while such concerns might cause an officer to proffer a reason that
is easier to articulate or less likely to be misconstrued, it does
not justify fabricating such a reason. In short, the Fourth
Amendment permits an officer to seize upon a traffic violation as
a pretext for stopping a vehicle in order to prevent, or discover
evidence of what an officer legitimately suspects is, criminal
activity but it does not permit an officer to invent a reason for
stopping a vehicle.

In this case, there is no need to consider whether facts
learned after the Subaru had been stopped provided probable cause
for the search that unearthed the firearm because the government
has failed to meet its burden of showing that the Subaru was

lawfully stopped, in the first place.

 

1In this case, the occupants of the Subaru were young
Hispanic males.
