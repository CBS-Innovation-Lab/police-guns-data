MEMORANDUM AND ORDER

 

WOLF, D.J. December 30, 2016

Petitioner Marcus Robinson is currently serving a 188-month
sentence for being an armed career criminal in possession of a
firearm. §§e 18 U.S.C. §§922, 924. He has, pro _§§, filed a
petition to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. §2255, alleging
ineffective assistance of counsel both at sentencing for failure
to raise certain arguments and after sentencing for failure to
file a notice of appeal. He has also moved to amend his petition

to include a claim under Johnson v. United States, 135 S. Ct.

 

2551 (2015).

For the reasons stated below, the court is ordering further
submissions to determine whether an evidentiary hearing is
required before deciding his claim of ineffective assistance of
counsel concerning the alleged failure to file a notice of
appeal. It is dismissing his claim of ineffective assistance of
counsel at sentencing without a hearing. It is also denying his

motion to amend.

Case 1:08-Cr-10027-I\/|LW Document 80 Filed 12/30/16 Page 2 of 22

I. BACKGROUND

On February 13, 2008, Robinson was indicted on multiple
federal firearm charges. Assistant Federal Public Defender
Timothy Watkins was appointed to represent him. On September 16,
2010, Robinson pled guilty to one count of being a felon in
possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §922(g)(1).
The remaining charges were dismissed.

On February 22, 2010, this court sentenced Robinson to 188
months in prison under the Armed Career Criminal Act (the
"ACCA"), 18 U.S.C. §924(e). His three predicate offenses were: a
1997 conviction for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon;
a 1998 conviction for distribution of cocaine near a school
zone; and a 2002 conviction for distribution of cocaine near a
school or park. §§e February 22, 2010 Transcript ("Tr.") at 8-
10. Judgment entered on March 5, 2010. No notice of appeal was
filed. The l4-day period in which to appeal expired on March 19,
2010. s_eg Fed. R. App. P. 4(b)(1)(A).

On August 12, 2010, Robinson sent a letter to the First
Circuit expressing his dissatisfaction with Mr. Watkins'
representation at sentencing and indicating that he wished to
appeal his sentence. The First Circuit treated the letter as a
pro §§ motion to file a late appeal. Upon learning of the
appeal, Mr. Watkins moved to withdraw from representation,

explaining that he believed the appeal was against Robinson's

2

Case 1:08-Cr-10027-|\/|LW Document 80 Filed 12/30/16 Page 3 of 22

interests and that Robinson's claims were better raised on
collateral review. The First Circuit allowed Mr. Watkins'
motion.

On August 19, 2010, the First Circuit ordered Robinson to
show cause as to why his appeal should not be dismissed as
untimely. It appointed appellate counsel on October 7, 2010.
Robinson responded on November 8, 2010. He argued that he had
instructed Mr. Watkins to file a timely notice of appeal, but
Mr. Watkins failed to do so, resulting in his late appeal. On
November 23, 2010, the First Circuit dismissed the appeal,
explaining that "[s]uch a claim is appropriately addressed in a
habeas petition, rather than in a direct appeal." United States
v. Robinson, No. 10-1981 (1st Cir. Nov. 23, 2010).

On. April 28, 2011, Robinson filed the instant motion to
vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. §2255 (the "Petition"). The
Petition asserts two grounds for relief, both alleging
ineffective assistance of counsel. In Ground One, Robinson
alleges that defense counsel was deficient for failing to file a
timely appeal despite Robinson's express instructions to do so.
In Ground Two, Robinson alleges that counsel was deficient for
failing to challenge Robinson's sentencing enhancement under 18
U.S.C. §924(e) and to request a competency evaluation under 18

U.S.C. §4241.

Case 1:08-Cr-10027-|\/|LW Document 80 Filed 12/30/16 Page 4 of 22

In response to the Petition, the government argues that
Robinson's claims are barred by the one-year statute of
limitations in §2255(f) and, in any event, are unmeritorious.
Accordingly, it requests that the court dismiss the Petition
without a hearing.

Robinson filed a reply to the government's arguments. On
August 31, 2015, Robinson also moved to amend the Petition by
adding a claim under Johnson v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2551
(2015). In his proposed amendment, Robinson argues that two of
the three convictions used to enhance his sentence under the
ACCA are no longer predicate offenses.

II. LEGAL STANDARD

A.§2255(b) Hearing Requirement

28 U.S.C. §2255 provides a federal prisoner with a means to
collaterally attack his sentence. Specifically:

28 U.S.C. §2255 sets forth four grounds upon which a

federal prisoner may base a claim for relief: (1)

"that the sentence was imposed. in 'violation. of the

Constitution or laws of the United States;" (2) "that

the court was without jurisdiction to impose such

sentence;" (3) "that the sentence was in excess of

the maximum authorized by law;" and (4) that the
sentence "is otherwise subject to collateral attack."

Knight V. United StateS, 37 F.3d 769, 772 (lSt Cir. 1994)

 

(quoting Hill v. United States, 368 U.S. 424, 426~27 (1962)).

 

Where, as here, a petitioner is acting pro §e, his petition must

be "liberally construed . . . [and] a pro §§ complaint, however

Case 1:08-Cr-10027-|\/|LW Document 80 Filed 12/30/16 Page 5 of 22

inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards

than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.“ Erickson v. Pardus,

 

551 U.S. 89, 94, (2007) (quoting Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97,

 

106 (1976)).

When a prisoner files a §2255 petition, 28 U.S.C. §2255(b)
requires that:

Unless the motion and the files and records of the
case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled
to no relief, the court shall cause notice thereof to
be served upon the United States attorney, grant a
prompt hearing thereon, determine the issues and make
findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect
thereto.

28 U.S.C. §2255(b). As the First Circuit wrote in United States
V. MCGill, ll F.3d 223 (lSt Cir. 1993):

We have distilled these principles into a rule that
holds a hearing to be unnecessary "when a §2255
motion (1) is inadequate on its face, or (2) although
facially adequate is conclusively refuted as to the
alleged facts by the files and records of the case."
Moran v. Hogan, 494 F.2d 1220, 1222 (1st Cir. 1974).
In other words, a "§2255 motion may be denied without
a hearing as to those allegations which, if accepted
as true, entitle the movant to no relief, or which
need not be accepted as true because they state
conclusions instead of facts, contradict the record,

 

or are 'inherently incredible.'" Shraiar v. United
States, 736 F.2d 817, 818 (1st Cir. 1984) (citations
omitted).

Id. at 225-26 (some citations omitted); see also Ellis v. United

 

States, 313 F.3d 636, 641 (lSt Cir. 2002).
The burden is on the petitioner to show, by a preponderance

of the evidence, that an evidentiary hearing is warranted. See

Case 1:08-cr-10027-|\/|LW Document 80 Filed 12/30/16 Page 6 of 22

Moreno-Morales v. United States, 334 F.3d 140, 145 (lst Cir.

 

2003); Myatt v. United States, 875 F.2d 8, 11 (lst Cir. 1989);

see also David v. United States, 134 F.3d 470, 478 (lst Cir.

 

1998) ("To progress to an evidentiary hearing, a habeas
petitioner must do more than proffer gauzy generalities or drop
self-serving hints that a constitutional violation lurks in the
wings.").

In deciding whether to hold an evidentiary hearing, "the
district court may make its preliminary assessment of the
motion's merits on an expanded record that may include 'in an

appropriate case, even. affidavits.'" Miller v. United States,

 

564 F.2d 103, 105 (lst Cir. 1977) (quoting Raines v. United

 

States, 423 F.2d 526, 530 (4th Cir. 1970)). "However, material
issues of fact may not be resolved against the petitioner solely
by relying on §§ parte, sworn or unsworn, statements of the

government or defense counsel." United States v. Butt, 731 F.2d

 

75, 77-78 (lst Cir. 1984) (internal citations omitted).
"Affidavits may assist only in determining if there is a genuine
issue of fact to resolve." Miller, 564 F.2d at 106 (citing

Blackledge v. Allison, 431 U.S. 63, 80 (1977)).

 

B.Ineffective Assistance of Counsel

 

"A defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel
must show (1) that counsel's representation 'fell below an

objective standard of reasonableness,' . . . and (2) that

Case 1:08-Cr-10027-|\/|LW Document 80 Filed 12/30/16 Page 7 of 22

counsel's deficient performance prejudiced the defendant[.]".

Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470, 476-77 (2000) (citing

 

Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 688, 694 (1984)); see

 

also Peralta v. United States, 597 F.3d 74, 79 (1st Cir. 2010).

 

"The burden is on the petitioner to demonstrate ineffective
assistance by a preponderance of the evidence.“ Lema v. United
States, 987 F.2d 48, 51 (lst Cir. 1993).

"In order to satisfy the 'deficient performance' prong, [a
movant] must show that his trial counsel's representation 'fell
below an. objective standard of reasonableness.'" Peralta, 597
F.3d at 79 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688). "'Judicial
scrutiny of counsel's performance must be highly deferential'
[and] the reviewing court "'must indulge ea strong presumption
that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable
professional assistance.'" United States v. Valerio, 676 F.3d
237, 246 (lst Cir. 2012) (quoting Strickland, 446 U.S. at 689).
"It is only where, given the facts known at the time, counsel's
choice was so patently unreasonable that no competent attorney
would. have made it, that the ineffective assistance prong is

satisfied." Knight v. Spencer, 447 F.3d 6, 15 (lst Cir. 2006)

 

(internal quotation marks omitted).
"With regard to the prejudice prong of Strickland, ‘[t]he
defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,

but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the

7

Case 1:08-Cr-10027-|\/|LW Document 80 Filed 12/30/16 Page 8 of 22

proceeding would have been different.‘" Valerio, 676 F.3d at
246-47 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694). "Although [the
defendant] need not show 'that counsel's deficient conduct more
likely than not altered the outcome' of his sentencing
proceeding, he must establish 'a probability sufficient to
undermine confidence in [that] outcome.' Peralta, 597 F.3d at 80

(quoting Porter v. McCollum, 558 U.S. 30, 44 (2009)).

 

III. MOTION TO DISMISS ROBINSON'S §2255 PETITION

In Ground One of the Petition, Robinson alleges that
defense counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to
file a notice of appeal. In Ground Two, he asserts that counsel
was ineffective for failing to challenge his ACCA designation or
move for a competency evaluation at sentencing. Robinson
requests an evidentiary hearing on both grounds. The government
argues that the Petition is untimely and, in any event,
unmeritorious, and should be dismissed without a hearing.

For the reasons explained below, the court finds that
additional information is required to decide whether Ground One
is timely and meritorious. Accordingly, the court is ordering
additional submissions, and may order an evidentiary hearing, as
described in Part V, in§£§. As to Ground Two, the court finds

that the record "conclusively show[s]" Robinson is not entitled

Case 1:08-Cr-10027-|\/|LW Document 80 Filed 12/30/16 Page 9 of 22

to relief, It is, therefore, dismissing Ground 'Two without a
hearing.l See 28 U.S.C. §2255(b).

A.Ground One: Ineffective Assistance for Failure to File
Notice of Appeal

 

1.Statute of Limitations

 

A petition for relief under §2255 must be brought within
one year of the latest of:

(1) the date on which the judgment of conviction
becomes final;

(2) the date on which the impediment to making a
motion created by governmental action in violation of
the Constitution or laws of the United States is
removed, if the movant was prevented from making a
motion by such governmental action;

(3) the date on which the right asserted was
initially recognized. by the Supreme Court, if that
right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court
and made retroactively applicable to cases on
collateral review; or

(4) the date on which the facts supporting the claim
or claims presented could have been discovered
through the exercise of due diligence.

28 U.S.C. §2255(£). Robinson's conviction became final on March

19, 2010, when his time to appeal expired.2 He filed his Petition

 

1 Because the court finds that Ground Two is unmeritorious, see
Part III.B, infra, it is not deciding whether Ground Two is
timely under §2255(f).

2 Although neither the Supreme Court nor the First Circuit has
directly addressed the issues, numerous other courts have held
that "an unappealed federal criminal judgment becomes final for
the purposes of §2255(f) . . . when the time expires for filing
a direct appeal. United States v. Gaudette, No. CR O9-30014-GAO,

 

9

Case 1:08-Cr-10027-|\/|LW Document 80 Filed 12/30/16 Page 10 of 22

on April 28, 2011, one year and 40 days later. The Petition is
not, therefore, timely under §2255(£)(1).

However, Ground One may be timely under §2255(f)(4). Under
subsection (f)(4), the limitations period for Ground One began
to run "when a duly diligent person in [Robinson's]
circumstances would have discovered that no appeal had been

filed." United States v. Wims, 225 F.3d 186, 190 (2d Cir. 2000);

 

Cooper v. Bravo, 36 Fed. App'x 343, 346 (10th Cir. 2002). This
determination is "fact-specific and 'depends, among other
things, on the details of [Robinson's] post-sentence
conversation with his lawyer and on the conditions of his

confinement.'" Agosto v. United States, No. 04-CR-10336-NMG-5,

 

2012 WL 3518130, at *7 (D. Mass. Aug. 15, 2012) (quoting Wims,
225 F.3d at 190-91).

Robinson alleges that he "vehemently urged" counsel to file
an appeal and that counsel "more than assured" him an appeal
would be filed. Petition at 9. However, no other evidence
concerning the details of his post-sentencing conversations with
counsel have been presented to the court. The record does not,
therefore, conclusively establish whether a person acting with

due diligence would have discovered counsel's failure to file a

 

2015 WL 6870051, at *1 (D. Mass. Nov. 6, 2015) (collecting
cases).

10

Case 1:08-Cr-10027-|\/|LW Document 80 Filed 12/30/16 Page 11 of 22

notice of appeal within 40 days of his conviction becoming
final. §§§ Wims, 225 F.3d at 191 (5-month delay in discovering
counsel's failure to appeal was "not so clearly' unreasonable
that it plainly appears from the face of appellant's petition

that he is barred from habeas relief"); Cooper, 36 Fed.
App'x at 346 (3-month delay in discovering counsel's failure to
appeal may be reasonable); Agosto, 2012 WL 3518130, at *7
(record did not Conclusively establish that 5-month delay in
discovering counsel's failure to appeal was unreasonable); see

also United States v. Goldman, No. 92-CR-10229-MLW, 2015 WL

 

4762746, at *2 (D. Mass. Aug. 12, 2015) (permitting additional
briefing on 113-day delay in discovering counsel's failure to
appeal). The court is, therefore, not dismissing Ground One as
untimely.

2.Ineffective Assistance of Counsel

Failure to file a notice of appeal may constitute

ineffective assistance of counsel. See Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528

 

U.S. 470, 476-77 (2000). Where, as here, counsel consulted the
petitioner about the possibility of appeal, "the question. of
deficient performance is easily answered: Counsel performs in a
professionally unreasonable manner only by failing to follow the
defendant's express instructions with respect to an appeal." §d;
at 478. To show prejudice, "a defendant must demonstrate that

there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's

ll

Case 1:08-Cr-10027-|\/|LW Document 80 Filed 12/30/16 Page 12 of 22

deficient failure to consult with him about an appeal, he would
have timely appealed." ld; at 484. The defendant is not required
to specify the issues he would have raised on appeal or show
that those issues are meritorious. ld; at 486.

Robinson asserts that he instructed counsel to appeal; that
counsel assured him an appeal would be filed; and that counsel
abandoned him at the beginning of the appeals process. This is
sufficient to allege deficient performance. See Flores-Ortega
528 U.S. at 478. Robinson further alleges that, but for
counsel's allegedly deficient conduct, he would have challenged
his ACCA. designation. on appeal. This is sufficient to allege
prejudice. §§§ id; at 484. Accordingly, Robinson's allegations
are facially adequate to allege ineffective assistance of
counsel under Flores-Ortega. If these allegation are true,
Robinson will be entitled to an appeal. §§§ id; at 484; United

States v. Santos-Rios, 151 F. App'x 2, at M (lst Cir. 2005)

 

(unpublished) (citing `United States v. Torres-Otero, 232 F.3d
24, 32 (lst Cir. 2000)).

The government argues that the record does not support
Robinson's allegations. It asks the court to infer, from

Robinson's August 12, 2010 pro §§ letter to the First Circuit

12

Case 1:08-Cr-10027-|\/|LW Document 80 Filed 12/30/16 Page 13 of 22

and Mr. Watkins' motion to withdraw, that Robinson never
instructed counsel to appeal.3

It is true that Robinson did not make any allegations about
counsel's deficient conduct in his August 12, 2010 letter
seeking to appeal late. §§§ Docket No. 62. At that time he
evidently had the hope that the First Circuit would accept his
appeal and that he would not be required to establish
ineffective assistance of counsel to have the merit of it
decided. In any event, Robinson's letter is consistent with his
allegation that he intended to appeal his sentence.

As to Mr. Watkins' unsworn notice of withdrawal, it merely
states that his decision not to file a notice of appeal "was []
deliberate and made after [] consultation with defendant."
Docket No. 64 at 1 n.1. It does not state whether that decision
was against Robinson's express wishes. In any event, "material
issues of fact may not be resolved against the petitioner solely

by relying on §x: parte, sworn or unsworn, statements of the

 

3 The government also argues that the fact that Robinson pled
guilty undermines his claim that he wished to appeal. Under
Flores-Ortega, a defendant's guilty plea is relevant to whether
counsel was deficient for failing to consult the defendant about
an. appeal at all. 528 U.S. at 478-480. In the instant case,
however, it is undisputed that Mr. Watkins consulted Robinson
about the possibility of an appeal. Accordingly, the relevant
question is not whether counsel believed Robinson would want to
appeal, but whether counsel "fail[ed] to follow the defendant's
express instructions with respect to an appeal." ld; at 478.

13

Case 1:08-cr-10027-|\/|LW Document 80 Filed 12/30/16 Page 14 of 22

government or defense counsel." §ut§, 731 F.2d at 77-78
(internal citations omitted).

The current record shows, at most, that there is a dispute
as to whether Robinson expressly instructed his counsel to file
a notice of appeal or whether he was prejudiced by counsel's
alleged failure to do so. It does not, however, conclusively
show that he is not entitled to relief on Ground One.

B.Ground Two: Ineffective Assistance at Sentencing

 

1.Failure to Challenge ACCA Designation

 

Robinson also alleges that defense counsel was ineffective
for failing to challenge his designation as an armed career
criminal under the ACCA. As indicated earlier, Robinson's
sentenced was enhanced under the ACCA based on three predicate
offenses: a 1997 conviction for assault and battery with a
dangerous weapon; a 1998 conviction for distribution of cocaine
near a school zone; and a 2002 conviction for distribution of
cocaine near a school or park. §§§ February 22, 2010 Tr. at 8-
10. Robinson now asserts that one of his drug convictions "was
reduced from a Serious offense to a Misdemeanor Drug Violation"
and, therefore, that defense counsel should have argued that the
offense was not a predicate under the ACCA. Petition at 12.

Robinson does not indicate which of his two predicate drug
offenses counsel should have challenged. Reading Robinson's pro

§§ petition liberally, it appears that his claim is based on the

14

Case 1:08-cr-10027-|\/|LW Document 80 Filed 12/30/16 Page 15 of 22

fact that the 2002 offense was prosecuted in District Court
rather than Superior Court. A Massachusetts District Court may
not impose a sentence of more than two and a half years in jail
or a house of corrections. _S_e_e_ M.G.L. c. 218 §27. However, under
the "categorical approach" required by the Supreme Court, it is
the statute, not the court in which he was convicted, that
determines whether a particular offense is an ACCA predicate.

See United States v. Moore, 286 F.3d 47, 49 (lst Cir. 2002).

 

Robinson was convicted in 2002 of distribution of a class B
controlled substance, which is punishable by up to 10 years in
prison. §e_e M.G.L. c. 94C, §32A(a). That conviction is,
therefore, a "serious drug offense" under the ACCA. §§ M_ogr£,
286 F.3d at 49. The record conclusively shows that defense
counsel was not deficient for failing to challenge Robinson's
ACCA designation on this basis.

2. Failure to Request a Competency Evaluation

Robinson also alleges that defense counsel was ineffective
for failing to request a competency evaluation under 18 U.S.C.
§4241. "'The failure of trial counsel to request a competency
hearing where there was evidence raising a substantial doubt
about a petitioner's competence to stand trial may constitute
ineffective assistance of counsel.'" United States v. Sampson,
820 F. Supp. 2d 202 (D. Mass. 2011) (quoting Vogt v. United

States, 88 F.3d 587, 592 (8th Cir. 1996)).

15

Case 1:08-Cr-10027-|\/|LW Document 80 Filed 12/30/16 Page 16 of 22

In Robinson's case, there was no evidence of incompetence.
In Robinson's appearances before the court he never exhibited
any sign that he was "unable to understand the nature and
consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist
properly in his defense."4 18 U.S.C. §4241(a). Indeed, the court
found him to be competent when he pled guilty. §§e Sept. 16,
2009 Tr. at 14:17-21. Accordingly, there is no basis for finding
that counsel was deficient for failing to request a competency
evaluation, or that Robinson would have benefited from such an

evaluation, See Robidoux v. O'Brien, 643 F.3d 334, 338-40

 

(neither prong of Strickland satisfied, where there was "little
evidence anywhere that [petitioner] failed to understand the
proceedings and virtually none that he was unable to cooperate
with counsel."). The court need not credit Robinson's conclusory
assertions to the contrary. §ee Shraiar, 736 F.2d at 818.

In 'vievr of the foregoing, Ground Two is being dismissed
without a hearing.

IV . MOTION TO AMEND

Robinson has moved to amend the Petition to include a claim
under Johnson v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015). Robinson

asserts that he was improperly sentenced as a career offender

 

4 The presentence report stated that Robinson was treated for
depression in 1993, but did not include any evidence of a
contemporaneous mental illness, disease, or defect.

16

Case 1:08-Cr-10027-|\/|LW Document 80 Filed 12/30/16 Page 17 of 22

under the ACCA based on predicate offenses that were not
"violent felonies" or "serious drug offenses.“ §e§ 18 U.S.C.
§924(e)(2). Specifically, he challenges the predicates in
paragraphs 42 and 46 ¢yf his presentence report ("PSR"), which
are for vandalism and larceny respectively.

Robinson's claim is based on a ndsreading of the record,
Robinson's initial PSR erroneously indicated that his ACCA
designation was based on the convictions described in paragraphs
41, 42, and 46 of the report. However, as the Probation Officer
explained at the sentencing hearing, the citations should have
instead been to paragraphs 40, 41, and 45. §§e Feb. 22, 2010 Tr.
at 2:22-3:3. The convictions in these paragraphs are for assault
and battery with a dangerous weapon and, in two instances,
distribution of a class B controlled substance. Each is an ACCA
predicate offense. The correction. was reflected in the final
PSR.

The record conclusively shows that the claim Robinson seeks
to assert under Johnson is unmeritorious. His motion to amend
is, therefore, futile.

V. EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL

For the reasons stated in Parts III.A.l and 2, supra,
before deciding Ground One of Robinson's Petition, the court
must make factual findings concerning, among other things, the

details of Robinson's post-sentencing conversations with Mr.

17

Case 1:08-Cr-10027-|\/|LW Document 80 Filed 12/30/16 Page 18 of 22

Watkins. lt is not clear from the current record whether the
details of those conversations are disputed. The appropriate
approach in these circumstances is to order additional
affidavits to "assist [] in determining if there is a genuine
issue of fact to resolve." Miller, 564 F.2d at 106. If so, an
evidentiary hearing is required under §2255(b). §§e §EE§, 731
F.2d at 77-78.

The details of Robinson's conversations with defense
counsel would ordinarily be privileged. Accordingly, the court
hereby informs Robinson that, if he persists in claiming
ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with counsel's
failure to file a <iirect appeal, he will waive his attorney-
client privilege with respect to all communications with his
attorney that are relevant to proving or disproving his claim.

See Johnson v. Alabama, 256 F.3d 1156, 1178-79 (11th Cir. 2001).

 

Defendant is being ordered to report, by January 17, 2017,
whether he wishes to: (1) proceed with Ground Two and waive his
privilege with regard to the relevant communications, or (2)
withdraw Ground Two and preserve his privilege. §ee Bittaker v.
Woodford, 331 F.3d 715, 720 (9th Cir. 2003) ("The court imposing
[a] waiver [of privilege] does not order disclosure of the
materials categorically; rather, the court directs the party
holding the privilege to produce the privileged materials if it

wishes to go forward with its claims implicating them.").

If Robinson chooses to proceed, Mr. Watkins shall, by
January 31, 2017, submit an affidavit addressing the issues
raised in this Memorandum and Order. The government shall, by
February 14, 2017, file a memorandum and any supporting
affidavits addressing whether there are any material disputes of
fact in this case, Robinson shall respond by February 28, 2017,
The court will then, decide whether an evidentiary' hearing is
required.

"Rule 8(c) [of the Rules Governing §2255 Proceedings]
requires the court to appoint counsel for indigent petitioners
if it holds a §2255 evidentiary hearing." Bucci v. United
States, 662 F.3d 18, 34 (lst Cir. 2011). Before appointing
counsel, however, the court must make an "appropriate inquiry"
as to the petitioner's ability to pay for counsel. 18 U.S.C.
§3006A(b). Robinson has moved for appointment of counsel, but
has not submitted an affidavit concerning his ability to pay.
Accordingly, Robinson must now file a financial affidavit using
the CJA-23 Form attached hereto. The court will determine
whether to appoint counsel pursuant to §2255 Rule 8(c) and, in
any event, whether counsel should be appointed as a matter of
discretion under 18 U.S.C. §3006A.

VI. CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY

Pursuant to Rule ll(a) of the Rules Governing Section 2255

Proceedings, the court must “issue or deny a certificate of

Case 1:08-cr-10027-|\/|LW Document 80 Filed 12/30/16 Page 20 of 22

appealability when it enters a final order adverse to the
applicant." To receive a COA, a petitioner must make "a
substantial showing of a denial of a constitutional right." §e§
28 U.S.C. §2253(€)(2). In other words, a COA is vmrranted if
"'reasonable jurists would find the district court's assessment
of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.'" Miller-El v.

Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 338 (2003) (quoting Slack v. McDaniel,

 

529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000)). A claim can be debatable "even though
every jurist of reason might agree, after the COA has been
granted and the case has received full consideration, that
petitioner will not prevail." §§;

The court finds that no reasonable jurist would conclude
that Ground Two of Robinson's Petition, which is contradicted by
the record, is meritorious. Nor would a reasonable jurist debate
the conclusion that Robinson's motion to amend, which was based
on a misreading of the record, is futile. Therefore, the court
is denying a COA on Robinson's claims to the extent that they
are being dismissed by this Memorandum and Order. He may seek a
COA from the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. §ee §2255
Rule 11(a).

VII. ORDER

1. Ground Two of Robinson's Motion to Vacate under 28
