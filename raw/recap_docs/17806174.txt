                                        ORDER

WILLIAM E. SMITH, United States District Judge.

      On May 1, 2012, Defendant-Petitioner Jose Lazala filed a

Motion Under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct

Sentence by a Person in Federal Custody.              (ECF No. 231.)     Lazala

alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, and his argument was

based, in part, on the Supreme Court’s decision in Padilla v.

Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356 (2010).              On July 29, 2013, this Court

issued a Memorandum and Order denying and dismissing Lazala’s

motion.     (ECF No. 249.)          Lazala now moves, pursuant to Rule

60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for the Court to

reconsider this ruling. 1         (ECF No. 250.)

      To the extent the instant motion merely reasserts Lazala’s

Padilla    argument,    it   is    an    improper    “second   or   successive”

      1
        The day before he filed the instant motion to reconsider,
Lazala also filed a notice of appeal regarding this Court’s
order denying and dismissing his § 2255 motion. (ECF No. 251.)
The First Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently indicated that
the notice of appeal would not become effective until this
Court’s ruling on the motion for reconsideration.       (ECF No.
259.)

petition and,      accordingly,       must     be   dismissed.      See    Munoz     v.

United States, 331 F.3d 151, 152–53 (1st Cir. 2003).

      Lazala also seeks leave to amend his § 2255 motion but

neglects    to   explain      his    desired    amendment.        The    only     legal

argument referenced in his motion is predicated on Padilla.                         Any

amendment regarding this claim would be futile.                     To the extent

Lazala contests the validity of the prior conviction resulting

in his deportation and the present illegal re-entry charge, his

challenge      would    be     more    properly      directed      at    the      prior

conviction itself.           See United States v. Arroyo-Garcia, 751 F.

Supp.   172,     173   (D.    Nev.    1990)     (“Although   the    authority        on

whether a defendant may attack an earlier criminal conviction in

a prosecution under 8 U.S.C. § 1326 is scant, the few cases on

point, although old, do suggest that defendant cannot.”).                            To

the extent Lazala contends that defense counsel in the present

case failed to advise him of the immigration consequences of his

guilty plea, his claim is utterly implausible.                     Indeed, Lazala

had been previously deported for a different conviction, and he

does not explain how his guilty plea in the present case altered

his immigration status.

      Finally,     Lazala      asserts     that     he   should    be     given     the

opportunity       to    respond       to       an   unspecified         report      and

recommendation by a magistrate judge, which he claims to have

never received.        However, there was no report and recommendation

                                           2

issued in connection with Lazala’s § 2255 motion.                This Court

issued an order denying and dismissing that motion.                  Indeed,

Lazala attached a copy of the Court’s order to his motion for

reconsideration.

      For     the    foregoing      reasons,      Lazala’s     motion     for

reconsideration is DENIED.



IT IS SO ORDERED.
