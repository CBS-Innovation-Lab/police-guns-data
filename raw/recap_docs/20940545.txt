                 RECOMMENDED DECISION ON 28 U.S.C. § 2255 MOTION

        Petitioner Eugene Erwin Allen has filed a motion, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255, to

vacate, set aside or correct his sentence. (Motion, ECF No. 115.) After review of the

motion and the record in accordance with Rule 4(b) of the Rules Governing Section 2255

Proceedings, I recommend the Court dismiss the motion.

                                              DISCUSSION

        The record establishes that Petitioner’s motion is a second or successive motion;

Petitioner’s first section 2255 motion is docketed at Allen v. United States, No. 1:07-cv-

00039-JAW. The pending motion concerns the same underlying criminal judgment as the

first, which was decided against Petitioner on the merits.1



1
  The final order in Petitioner’s first 28 U.S.C. § 2255 motion is dated May 22, 2007, and is docketed at
Allen v. United States, No. 1:07-cv-00039-JAW (D. Me. May 22, 2007) (Order on Report and
Recommended Decision, ECF No. 9). In United States v. Allen, No. 1:03-cr-00058-JAW, the docket entry
for the prior section 2255 judgment is dated April 18, 2007, and indicates that later entries in the section
2255 action could be found under the civil docket number. By order dated April 27, 2007, and docketed at
No. 1:07-cv-00039-JAW, the Court granted Petitioner’s Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) motion for relief and vacated
the April 18, 2007, judgment. On May 22, 2007, the Court affirmed the recommended decision. Petitioner
subsequently filed three additional section 2255 motions. (ECF Nos. 75, 91, 100.)
          This Court lacks jurisdiction to consider a second or successive section 2255 motion

unless the First Circuit has specifically authorized the Court to consider it. Title 28 U.S.C.

§ 2244 applies to second or successive section 2255 motions, pursuant to section 2255(h).2

Section 2244(b)(3)(A) states: “Before a second or successive application permitted by this

section is filed in the district court, the applicant shall move in the appropriate court of

appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.” See also

First Circuit Rule 22.1. The First Circuit has held: “We have interpreted [section 2255(h)]

as ‘stripping the district court of jurisdiction over a second or successive habeas petition

unless and until the court of appeals has decreed that it may go forward.’” Trenkler v.

United States, 536 F.3d 85, 96 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Pratt v. United States, 129 F.3d 54,

57 (1st Cir. 1997)).

          The record lacks any evidence to suggest the First Circuit has authorized Petitioner to file

the current section 2255 motion. To the contrary, the First Circuit recently denied Petitioner’s

application to file a second or successive motion. Allen v. United States, No. 16-2517 (1st

Cir. April 4, 2017). (USCA Judgment, ECF No. 114.)




2
    Section 2255(h) provides that

          [a] second or successive motion must be certified as provided in section 2244 by a panel
          of the appropriate court of appeals to contain –

              (1) newly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a
              whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no
              reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense; or

              (2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by
              the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.


                                                      2
        Because the record does not reflect that the First Circuit has authorized Petitioner to

proceed on a second or successive motion, the Court is without jurisdiction to consider the

merits of the motion. Trenkler, 536 F.3d at 96. First Circuit Rule 22.1(e) provides that if

a second or successive section 2255 petition is filed in the district court without the required

authorization from the Circuit, the district court “will transfer the petition to the court of

appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1631 or dismiss the petition.” The issue, therefore, is

whether the Court should dismiss or transfer the matter. Given the First Circuit’s recent

denial of Petitioner’s request to file a second or successive petition, dismissal is

appropriate.3

                                              CONCLUSION

        Based on the foregoing analysis, after a review in accordance with Rule 4(b) of the

Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings, I recommend the Court dismiss Petitioner’s

section 2255 motion. (Motion, ECF No. 115.)



                                                NOTICE

               A party may file objections to those specified portions of a magistrate
        judge’s report or proposed findings or recommended decisions entered
        pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 636(b)(1)(B) for which de novo review by the district
        court is sought, together with a supporting memorandum, within fourteen
        (14) days of being served with a copy thereof.

  In support of his section 2255 motion, Petitioner cites the United States Supreme Court’s decisions in
Mathis v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2243 (2016) and Johnson v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015). (ECF
No. 115-1.) Petitioner evidently relied upon the same authority in support of his request of the First Circuit
to file a second or successive section 2255 motion. (USCA Judgment, ECF No. 114.)

                                                      3
             Failure to file a timely objection shall constitute a waiver of the right
      to de novo review by the district court and to appeal the district court's order.
