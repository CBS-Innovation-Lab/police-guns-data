                  ORDER AFFIRMING THE
       RECOMMENDED DECISIONS OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE

      In this action, Raymond L. Ellis, Jr. moved pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 to

vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence of 120 months imprisonment.           The

Magistrate Judge recommended that the Court deny Mr. Ellis’s motion. Mr. Ellis

then moved to amend his § 2255 motion. The Magistrate Judge entered a second

Recommended Decision, in order to allow a separate de novo review by this Court,

which recommended that the Court deny Mr. Ellis’s motion to amend. The Court now

affirms the Magistrate Judge’s Recommended Decisions and denies Mr. Ellis’s § 2255

motion and his motion to amend.

I.    BACKGROUND

      On July 7, 2009, Mr. Ellis pleaded guilty to theft of firearms from a federal

firearms licensee, conspiracy to commit theft, and possession of firearms as a

convicted felon. Information at 1–4 (ECF No. 5); Min. Entry (ECF No. 11). On

December 29, 2009, the Court sentenced Mr. Ellis to 120 months in prison on each of

Counts 1 and 3, and 60 months on Count 2, all to be served concurrently. J. at 2 (ECF
No. 29). Mr. Ellis appealed his sentence to the United States Court of Appeals for the

First Circuit and on March 17, 2011, the First Circuit affirmed the sentence. Notice

of Appeal (ECF No. 31); J. at 1 (ECF No. 55).

      On January 4, 2016, Mr. Ellis moved pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 to vacate,

set aside, or correct his sentence. Mot. Under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 to Vacate, Set Aside,

or Correct Sentence by a Person in Federal Custody (ECF No. 59) (Def.’s Mot.). He

argues that the Court erred as a matter of law by enhancing his sentence pursuant

to U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) and contends that the applicable guideline range was 92 to

115 months, not the 135 to 168 months found by the Court at sentencing. Id. at 4; id.

Attach. 1 Mem. of Law at 1–3 (Def.’s Mem.). Mr. Ellis also argues that his counsel

was ineffective for failing to raise this issue. Def.’s Mot. at 5; Def.’s Mem. at 4–7. Mr.

Ellis requests resentencing based on the alleged correct guideline range of 92 to 115

months. Def.’s Mot. at 13; Def.’s Mem. at 7. On February 3, 2016, the Magistrate

Judge ordered the Government to respond and address only the statute of limitations

issue. Order to Answer (ECF No. 62). The Government responded on June 3, 2016.

Gov’t’s Resp. to Pet’r’s Mot. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 Insofar as Statute of

Limitations Issue is Presented; and Mot. for Summ. Dismissal (ECF No. 69). Mr. Ellis

replied on July 1, 2016. Pet’r’s Reply (ECF No. 70).

      On November 14, 2016, the Magistrate Judge entered a recommended decision

as to Mr. Ellis’s motion under § 2255. Recommended Decision on 28 U.S.C. § 2255

Mot. (ECF No. 72) (Rec. Dec. § 2255). On December 15, 2016, Mr. Ellis filed a motion

to amend the original § 2255 motion. Mot. to Amend (ECF No. 73). On December 30,



                                            2
2016, the Government filed a response to the motion to amend. Gov’t’s Resp. to Pet’r’s

Mot. to Amend his Untimely 28 U.S.C. § 2255 Pet. and Renewed Mot. for Summ.

Dismissal (ECF No. 74) (Gov’t’s Resp. to Amend Mot.). Mr. Ellis replied on January

30, 2017. Pet’r’s Resp. to the Gov’t’s Rebutt[al] of his 2255 (ECF No. 75). Based on

the amended motion and subsequent response and reply, on March 10, 2017, the

Magistrate Judge entered a second recommendation in order to afford the Court the

opportunity to apply the same standard of review to both decisions. Recommended

Decision on Mot. to Amend at 1 n.1 (ECF No. 76) (Rec. Dec. Amend). Mr. Ellis objected

to both of the recommended decisions on April 24, 2017. Resp. (ECF No. 79). The

Government did not file a reply to Mr. Ellis’s objection.

II.   DISCUSSION

      The Magistrate Judge recommended that the Court deny Mr. Ellis’s 28 U.S.C.

§ 2255 motion. Rec. Dec. § 2255 at 7. As the Magistrate Judge pointed out, Mr. Ellis’s

claims are subject to a one-year statute of limitations, which runs from the latest of:

      (1) the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final;

      (2) the date on which the impediment to making a motion created by
      governmental action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the
      United States is removed, if the movant was prevented from making a
      motion by such governmental action;

      (3) the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the
      Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme
      Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or

      (4) the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented
      could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.




                                           3
Rec. Dec. § 2255 at 5 (citing 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f)). Mr. Ellis did not file a petition for

certiorari, so the one-year limitation period under 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f)(1) began to run

upon the expiration of the time to file a petition for certiorari and expired one year

later, which in this case would have been June 2012. Id. at 5–6. Because Mr. Ellis

placed his motion in the prison mailing system in December 2015, more than three

years after the expiration of the limitations period, his § 2255 motion is untimely.

See id. at 6. Additionally, as noted by the Magistrate Judge, Mr. Ellis has not alleged

any facts or made any arguments to suggest that the limitations period is governed

by § 2255(f)(2), (3), or (4). See id.

       Furthermore, the Magistrate Judge correctly stated that Mr. Ellis’s limited

knowledge of the law and limited access to legal materials or the courts during

periods when he was placed in more restrictive housing conditions “do not in

themselves” justify the “appropriate instances” required for equitable tolling. See id.

at 6–7 (citing Lattimore v. Dubois, 311 F.3d 46, 55 (1st Cir. 2002)). Moreover, as

noted by the Magistrate Judge, Mr. Ellis’s lack of access to legal materials due to

segregation did not occur within the one-year limitation period. Id. Rather, Mr.

Ellis’s access to legal materials and the courts were only restricted after the one-year

limitation period had already passed. Id. For these reasons, the Court agrees with

the Magistrate Judge’s recommended decision to deny Mr. Ellis’s § 2255 motion.

       The Magistrate Judge also separately entered a recommended decision to deny

Mr. Ellis’s motion to amend his § 2255 motion. Rec. Dec. Amend. Mr. Ellis’s motion

to amend seeks to assert a claim under 28 U.S.C. § 2255(f)(3), following the United



                                           4
States Supreme Court’s holdings in Johnson v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015).

Mot. to Amend at 1. In Johnson, the Supreme Court held the residual clause of the

Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), is unconstitutionally vague

and violates the Constitution’s guarantee of due process. 135 S. Ct. at 2563. Mr.

Ellis asserts that without the residual clause, his sentence would have to be enhanced

under the force clause and argues that the burglary charges within his criminal

history should not count towards his sentence because they are not “violent crimes”

as defined in the force clause. Mot. to Amend at 2–6.

      The Magistrate Judge denied the motion to amend as futile for two main

reasons: (1) the claim is precluded under Beckles v. United States, 137 S. Ct. 886

(2017), and (2) even if Beckles did not apply, Mr. Ellis was sentenced under the

enumerated offense clause, not the residual clause, and therefore Johnson does not

apply. Rec. Dec. Amend at 4–5. The Court agrees with the Magistrate Judge’s

reasoning on the first point—that under Beckles, the Johnson holding is not

applicable to the Guidelines. As to the second point, although the Court agrees with

the Magistrate Judge’s ultimate conclusion—that even without Beckles, Mr. Ellis

would not be entitled to relief under Johnson—the Court disagrees with one part of

the Magistrate Judge’s reasoning.

      The Magistrate Judge reasoned that the Johnson line of cases is not applicable

to Mr. Ellis’s claim because Johnson only removed the residual clause of the ACCA,

not the four enumerated offenses, one of which is burglary. Id. at 4. In other words,

the Magistrate Judge asserted that because Mr. Ellis’s sentencing range “was



                                          5
determined under the enumerated offenses clause, not the residual clause, of the

guidelines,” he would not be entitled to relief under Johnson. See id. at 4–5.

      Although it is true that had Mr. Ellis been sentenced under the career offender

guidelines, his underlying burglary convictions likely would have fallen under the

enumerated offenses clause and not the residual clause, Mr. Ellis’s sentence was in

actuality enhanced under U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6), not under the residual clause, force

clause, or enumerated offenses clause of the career offense guidelines, which are

found at U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2(a). See Revised Presentence Investigation Report at ¶¶ 16–

39.

      As the Government correctly identifies, the “felony offense” referenced in

U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) does not cross-reference the career-offender guideline and the

definition for “felony offense” is not “substantially the same as the career offender

guideline . . . in USSG [§§] 4B1.1 and 4B1.2.” Gov’t’s Resp. to Amend Mot. at 4–5.

Application Note 14 in the commentary to U.S.S.G. § 2K2.1(b)(6) simply defines

“another felony offense” as “any federal, state, or local offense . . . punishable by

imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.” This definition does not include the

additional requirement found in U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2, the career offender guidelines, that

the offense “has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical

force against the person of another” or “is a burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion,

involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious

potential risk of physical injury to another.” For these reasons, Mr. Ellis would not

be entitled to relief under Johnson.

III.   CONCLUSION

       The Court reviewed and considered the Magistrate Judge’s Recommended

Decisions, together with the entire record; the Court has made a de novo

determination of all matters adjudicated by the Magistrate Judge in both of the

Recommended Decisions; and concurs with the ultimate conclusions of the United

States Magistrate Judge.     For the reasons set forth in the Magistrate Judge’s

Recommended Decision on 28 U.S.C. § 2255 on November 14, 2016 and subsequently

in the Recommended Decision on Motion to Amend on March 10, 2017, and for those

reasons further explained in this order, the Court affirms the recommendations of

the Magistrate Judge.       This Court further affirms the Magistrate Judge’s

recommendation to deny a certificate of appealability pursuant to Rule 11 of the Rules

Governing Section 2255 Cases because there is no substantial showing of the denial

of a constitutional right within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2). The Court

determines that no further proceeding is necessary.

       1. It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision on 28
          U.S.C. § 2255 Motion (ECF No. 72) by the Magistrate Judge be and
          hereby is AFFIRMED.

       2. It is further ORDERED that the Petitioner’s Motion under § 2255 to
          Vacate, Set Aside or Correct Sentence (ECF No. 59) be and hereby is
          DENIED.

       3. It is further ORDERED that the Recommended Decision on Motion
          to Amend (ECF No. 76) by the Magistrate Judge be and hereby is
          AFFIRMED.

       4. It is further ORDERED that the Petitioner’s Motion to Amend (ECF
          No. 73) be and hereby is DENIED and that the Petitioner’s Objection
          to the Report and Recommended Decisions (ECF No. 79) be and
          hereby is OVERRULED.

                                          7
      SO ORDERED.
