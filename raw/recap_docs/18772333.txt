                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE




United States of America

     v.                                   Case No. 04-cr-181-01-PB

Kenneth Knight



                                  O R D E R


     The defendant has moved to continue the April 18, 2006 trial

in the above case.       Defendant’s wife recently passed away and

accordingly, additional time is requested so that he may deal

with getting her estate in order.         The government does not object

to a continuance of the trial date.

     Accordingly, for the above reason and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from April 18, 2006 to July 6, 2006.              In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. § 3161(h)(8)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the

ends of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the

best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
