______________________________________________________________________________

                        MOTION TO CONTINUE EMPANELMENT

       Now comes the accused, Carlos Andrade, by and through his counsel, and moves this
Honorable Court to continue this matter currently scheduled for empanelment for October 9, 2008
for an additional thirty (30) days. This Motion is filed in conjunction with a Motion for Enlargement
of Time For Filing Pretrial Motions. In addition, in both motions the accused moves this Court for
the exclusion of a total period of 30 days under the Speedy Trial Act.
       In support of this motion counsel states that she needs the additional time to review and
discuss with the defendant additional discovery recently received from the government.
       The Government and public will not be prejudiced by the delay, but will be benefitted by the
assurance that the criminal justice system is dedicated to fairness for all parties. As such, the
interests of justice in allowing this excludable time outweigh the interests of the public and the
defendant in a speedy trial.
       The time requested under this motion should be deemed excludable under the Speedy Trial
Act, 18 USC ยง 3161(h)(8).
       The Government, through Assistant United States Attorney Gerard B. Sullivan, indicates it
has no objection to the granting of this motion.

                                                      Respectfully submitted
