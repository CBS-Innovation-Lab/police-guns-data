                      IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                       FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND


UNITED STATES OF AMERICA



              v.



RALPH QUINONES


  GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT'S "MOTION TO RUN SENTENCES
     CONCURRENT PURSUANT TO 18 U.S.C. 3584(a)-NUNC PRO TUNC"

       On December 19, 2003, the defendant pled guilty to being a

felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C.                         ยง


922 (g)(1).        On April 2, 2004, this Court sentenced the defendant

to a term of imprisonment of 51 months, the low end of the

Sentencing Guideline range. The defendant failed to take an

appeal of that sentence.               Now, more than eighteen months after

sentence was imposed, the defendant asks this Court to "amend"

his    federal       sentence     by    ordering    that    that    sentence     run

concurrently with a state sentence imposed in Providence County

Superior Court Case No. P2/03-0401A.



First, his motion is not properly before the Court.                          By now

asking the Court to run his federal sentence concurrently with

his   state sentence, the defendant                is effectively asking the

Court to reduce his             federal sentence.          The problem      for the
     Case 1:03-cr-00078-T       Document 25    Filed 12/09/2005    Page 2 of 4



defendant is that there is no statute or procedural rule that

allows him to bring such a motion at this stage.                      The statute

that he cites, 18 U.S.C.             ยง    3584(a), simply provides that -
                                                                        at

sentencing,     when        a     defendant     faces     multiple      terms     of

imprisonment, a court may                impose such terms concurrently or

consecutively.        Section 3584 provides no authority for bringing

a motion to reduce a sentence long after sentence has been

imposed and appellate rights have been exercised or waived.

Indeed, the     only       rule    that    provides    for a      reduction of     a

sentence after sentence has been imposed is Federal Rule of

Criminal Procedure 35.            That Rule provides that a sentence may

be   reduced   "upon       the    qovernment s        motion."      Fed.R.Crim.P.

35(b) (1) (emphasis added).              The Rule contains no provision for

the filing of such a motion by a defendant.

     Second, even if the defendant's motion was properly before

the Court, it nonetheless should be                    denied.      The defendant

claims that at sentencing, the Court "expressed its willingness

to impose a concurrent sentence had                   Petitioner already been

sentenced in Superior Court of Rhode Island", but did not do so

because "the judge understood the applicable law at the time to

mean that a district court was unable to sentence Petitioner

concurrently     to    a    non-existent       state     sentence     yet    to   be

imposed."       This       mischaracterizes       the     Court's     ruling,     as
      Case 1:03-cr-00078-T   Document 25   Filed 12/09/2005   Page 3 of 4



evidenced by the sentencing transcript, attached as Exhibit A.

Far from expressing a willingness to impose a federal sentence

concurrent with any state sentence or sentences imposed, this

Court denied defendant's request to receive credit for the time

he had been held by the state because the defendant was facing a

term of imprisonment as a violator of his state probation:

              . . . my understanding is he's facing some
              violations. He's been incarcerated not only
              because of the pending state charge, but
              also because that charge is the basis for
              some violations. . . . So I don't think it's
              appropriate in this case, not being able to
              sort those out.    The violations relate to
              entirely separate matters, so I dontt think
              it would be appropriate to make that
              recommendation in this case.


Exhibit A, p. 13 (emphasis added).

        The Court was absolutely correct.           As paragraph 4 3 of the

February 12, 2004 Pre-Sentence Report indicates, the defendant

had    been    presented     as   a violator   of   a   three-year term of

probation imposed in the state case that the defendant would

have this Court run its sentence concurrent with, Providence

County Superior Court Case No. ~ 2 1 0 3 - 0 4 0 1 ~ .As paragraph 41 of

the Pre-Sentence Report indicates, the defendant had also been

presented as a violator of            an eight-year term of probation

imposed in Providence County Superior Court Case No. P 2 / 0 1 -

2707A.      Indeed, the state gun charge based on the incident that
   Case 1:03-cr-00078-T    Document 25       Filed 12/09/2005   Page 4 of 4



gave rise to the defendant's federal charge was dismissed by the

state shortly after the defendant's federal sentencing, on April

24, 2004.     Exhibit B.       Accordingly, even if the defendant's

motion were properly before this Court, it is substantively

unpersuasive.    What was true on April 2, 2004 is equally true

today. There is simply no reason why this Court should run its

sentence concurrently with a state sentence imposed for the

defendant's violation of his state court probation.

    2 APRIL 3 0 0 4 ' - 12:OO P.M.
              THE COURT:      Good morning.
        t     THE CLERK:      This is Criminal Action 03-78,

    United States df America versus Ralph Quinones.
              ,THE COURT:     This case is here for sentencing.
                4

    Mr. Quinonesa having previously pled guilty to a single
    count of being a felon in possession of a firearm or
    possessing a firearm after having previously been
    convicted            felony.
              Mr. Thdmpson, Mr. Quinones, have you both had an
    opportunity to review and discuss the Presentence
    Report?
              MR. THOMPSON:        Yes, your Honor.
              THE DEFENDANT:        Yes.
              THE COURT:      You may seated, Mr. Quinones.
              As I understand it, there is no objection to the
     report by either the defendant or the Government; is
     that correct?
              MR. NERONHA:       That is correct, your Honor.
              MR. THOMPSON:        That's correct, your Honor.
              THE COURT:      The Court has reviewed the
     presentence report and finds that the probation officer
     has correctly calculated the net offense level here as
     Level 17, anticipating the Government's motion for a
     three-level downward reduction for acceptance of
Case 1:03-cr-00078-T   Document 25-2    Filed 12/09/2005   Page 3 of 14




     responsibility, and the criminal history category as
     Category VI, and the guideline range as 51 to 63 ,
    , months.

                Now, I should mention to counsel, the Court just
     today received two handwritten letters from relatives
     of Mr. Quinones.         I don't know if counsel have seen
     those or not.        I'll give them to the clerk.              She can
     show them to counsel and we'll attach them to the
     presentence report.
                At this time, Mr. Quinones, you have the right
     to address the Court and say anything that you think
      should be considered in determining your sentence.                      Is
      there anything that you would like to say?
                (Mr. Thompson/Defendant Conferring)
                THE DEFENDANT:         I would like to apologize on the
      things that I done.        And the reason why I'm here today,
      because I was on drugs, I was doing crack, and I was
      doing Ectasy and stuff like that, and I'm asking if I

      could get in a drug program.             I never been to a

      rehabilitation, nothing like that.               I'm asking if it is
      possible I could get in a drug program.
                THE COURT:     All right.       Mr. Thompson?
                MR. THOMPSON:      Your Honor, I'm asking the Court
      to impose the low end of the sentencing range, 51
      months.     I believe a 51-month sentence is justified for
Case 1:03-cr-00078-T   Document 25-2   Filed 12/09/2005   Page 4 of 14




    a numbqr,of teasons.         One reason that a low end                        .   I




    sentence is justified in this case, your Honor, is that
    Mr!   Quinofies did plead to this case quickly, he never
    indicated any ihtention of fighting this case.                       He let
    the ~ o v e r b m e n tknow at the earliest possible date that
    he intended on pleading, and I think for that reason he
    did save the Court and the Government a substantial
    amount of resources.
              Far more importantly than that, your Honor, I
    believe the lo'w end is appropriate in this case based
    on Mr. Quinones' upbringing, his mental health, and
    drug abuse issues.         And I understand that that kind of
    argument can be made and typically is made in most of
    the sentencing cases before your Honor, but I think
    Mr. Quinones presents a unique defendant in the sense
    that he's had a lot of experience, obviously, in the
    juvenile court system and he's had a lot of experience,
    I think, in the adult State Court system, but he's
    never had any experience with the Federal Court system,
    and he's never had the opportunity that the Federal
    prison provides to a defendant.             And 1 think the
    variety of programs, vocational opportunities and
    educational opportunities available in the Federal
    Bureau of Prisons is really wonderfully suited for a

    defendant like Mr. Quinones.            He's still a young man,
Case 1:03-cr-00078-T   Document 25-2   Filed 12/09/2005   Page 5 of 14




      but he'$ had such difficult problems in his life, and I
      think there's a lot of programs that can stqrt ta

  I
      address each of these different things.               And when the
      Court remembers that'part of the role of imprisonment
      is rehabilitation, I think that a low end sentence is
      sufficient to punish the crime, but it's also
      sufficient to assure the Court that Mr. Quinones really
      will get a good and legitimate educational opportunity.
      He'll get good vocational opportunities, he'll get good
      mental health counseling, and he'll get good drug
      counseling.      And all those things, I think, are crucial
      for Mr. Quinones, given his life and his background.
              The presentence report, your Honor, details his
      difficult upbringing.        He was physically abused as a
      youth by his stepfather after his father left.                     He
      obviously had trouble in school his entire life, and it
      appears that was not simply based on behavioral
      problems, your Honor, but also just on some               --   the
      problems he faced inherent demonstrates - - the
      presentence report reports that he's borderline
      retarded, his IQ, his cumulative and verbal are both in
      the 8 0 1 s , he suffers from ADHD.        He spent a substantial
      time in special education and reports verbal
      disabilities and undisclosed or undiagnosed language
      disabilities.      In addition to the physical abuse he
Case 1:03-cr-00078-T   Document 25-2   Filed 12/09/2005   Page 6 of 14




     suffered,from his stepfather, he apparently saw a
     friend killed by the police and had suicide attempts as
     a qouth as well.          He started using alcohol and drugs at
                         1
     the age of 1 2 .        And from the probation report it
     appears,that each year he started using a new substance
                4

     to maybe trylto deal with these issues or hide from
     these issues, or maybe just because he was using drugs.
     I think the drug programs at the Federal Bureau of
     Prisons will assist him in dealing with some of these
     problems, a n d ' i n tandem with the mental health
     counseling programs available, it really might be able
     to get to the crux of the issues with him.                  He has
    mental disabilities, apparently, but I think the
     vocational opportunitie's will be a real asset to him as
     well.    This is a man as it stands right now based on
     the educational system failings, but clearly based on
     his own behavior as he was growing up, doesn't really
     have any meaningful skills of any kind, and so I think
     a 51-month sentence in the Federal Bureau of Prisons
     can assure that he has those things.
               It's noted in the presentence report, your
     Honor, and it's proposed that perhaps criminal history
     Category 6 underrepresents Mr. Quinones' criminal
     record, based on the fact that it totals 2 3 points as
     it is.     And it is correct that it does legitimately
Case 1:03-cr-00078-T   Document 25-2   Filed 12/09/2005   Page 7 of 14




    total 23' points.        I would point out to the Court,
    however, that by my count there are six cases in the
    presentence report that are misdemeanors that
    Mr. Quinones initially got a sentence of less than 30
    days' imprisonment, but then based on a subsequent
    violation, he received longer sentence in the future.
    Now, any sentence that he received above 60 days,
    amounts to two points on his criminal history score.
    The offenses listed in paragraphs 30, 33, 34, 35, 37,
    and 39, are all misdemeanors for which he initially had
    less than 60 days, but later violated and got a higher
    sentence.      He did violate and those are all legitimate
    convictions, your Honor, and those were the sentences.
    So they were appropriately assigned two points each.
              But based on what appears to be a revolving door
    system in the District Court, these all amount to two
    points when he never served substantial amounts of time
    on any of them.        If he hadn't received those
    violations, those would all be one-point convictions
    and that in itself would take off six points from his
    criminal history.         Then if you look at that in tandem
    with the fact that the guidelines direct that you can
    only have four one-point convictions added to your
    criminal history, after that it's just repetitive and
     it really doesn't reflect on a true criminal history,
Case 1:03-cr-00078-T    Document 25-2    Filed 12/09/2005   Page 8 of 14




    he alre,aqy has those four.            So if he hadn't violated on,
    those ,six cases and received sentences of over 60 days,
    heiwouldn"t receive two points on any of those cases,
    that,,would be tbelve points less on his criminal
    history, and he wouldn't even be in category 6, he
                I

    would be in category 5.             I'm not arguing
    overrepresent,ation at all, your Honor, I'm sincerely
    not.    But based on the fact that the District Court
    seems to just have a revolving door and he goes out and
    comes back in 'and goes out and comes back in, he has
    twelve points on his record that wouldn't be there if
    not for that system.          So I don't think it's
    overrepresented, but I also don't think an argument can
    be made that it is truly underrepresentative.
              I think a low end sentence is appropriate for,
    in this case, your Honor, this is a nonviolent offense,
    although he did flee from the police, obviously, but I
    think that the presentence report lays out for your
    Honor a lot of significant issues in Mr. Quinones'
    life, his mental health, his education, his
    psychological issues in his past, and I think the
    Bureau of Prisons can address all those things, and I
    think they can do it in the 51 months that the low end
    calls for.         Thank you.
              THE COURT:       Mr. Neronha?

              MR.   NERONHA:    Thank you, your Honor.              Just to
    clarify, the Government has, in fact, moved ,for the
  , third point.       The written motion was filed with the
    Court on December 29 'of 2 0 0 3 .        It was based on the fact
    that the defendant had timely,notified the Government
    of his intention to enter a plea of guilty.                     In effect,
    your Honor, that is in large part the reason for the
    Government's agreement in the plea agreement to
    recommend the low end of the guidelines.                  The
    Government, at least this prosecutor doesn't always
    make that agreement.
              I can think of a matter that I had on before
    Judge Lagueux just yesterday in which that was not the
    case.     The reason I did so in this case is in large
    part based on the fact that within days of the
     defendant's arrangement, it was made clear to me by
    Mr. Thompson that Mr. Quinones had indicated his
     willingness to plead guilty.            In fact, I have been in
     the office about a year and a half, and it was by far
     the quickest acknowledgement of responsibility that I
     had encountered.        So it was based on that in large part
     that the Government agreed to a low end recommendation.
     So, therefore, the Government in this case is
     recommending the low end of the guidelines and a term

     of imprisonment of 51 months.

              ,Wjth tespect to supervised release, the
    guideLines call for a period of two to three years.
    Thd Goverriment is recommending a period of three years,
    given that the defendant' s criminal history
    demonstrates an apparent inability to stay out of
    trouble    "'bile    is he on probation.         So given the choice
    of two to three years, the Government is recommending
    three years based on that criminal history.                    The
    Government is not recommending a fine, given that
    Mr. Quinones h'as no apparent ability to pay one, and of
     course, the $100 special assessment is mandatory.
    Thank you.
              THE COURT:       Mr. Quinones, would you stand up,
    please.      The Court generally begins with the
     assumption, Mr. Quinones, that a sentence should be in
     the middle of the guideline range unless there are
     factors that suggest a higher or lower sentence.
              In your case, there certainly is a factor
     suggesting a higher sentence, your criminal history is
     terrible.         You've had numerous convictions for a
     variety of offenses.          Mr. Thompson has done a very
     creative job of explaining why maybe it isn't quite as
     bad as it looks, and there may be something to the
     argument that there is a revolving door in the State
     Court, but nobody ever pushed you through the door.
Case 1:03-cr-00078-T    Document 25-2   Filed 12/09/2005   Page 11 of 14




       Whether the door was a revolving door or not, you're
       the one that ended up going through the doorl. Sol
     ,that's a matter of great concern to the Court, and if
       YOU   continue on this road, if this is any indication of
       your future behavior, you're going to find that the

       stakes get higher every time from here on out, as you
       find out in this case.           You have a guideline range of
       51 to 63 months.         You've never served more than, I
       believe it was something like six months at a time
       before.     And the next time around, if there is one,
       you're going to find the penalty is going to be even
       stiffer.        So you need to turn things around.
                 On the other side of the coin, the Government is
       recommending a sentence, a minimum sentence.                    I put a
       great deal of stock in the Government's
       recommendations.         I don't always accept them, but I
       certainly put a lot of stock in them.                 And as
       Mr. Neronha has pointed out, you did accept
       responsibility at the earliest possible time here so
       those things are in your favor.               I'm going to give you

       the benefit of the doubt here.              Ordinarily I would

       consider those things a wash, but I'm going to give you
       the benefit of the doubt, Mr. Quinones, and I am going
       to sentence you to a period of 51 months.
                 And I will ask the clerk to note on the judgment
Case 1:03-cr-00078-T   Document 25-2   Filed 12/09/2005   Page 12 of 14




     form, fhqt the Court recommends, as you requested, a n d ,
     I would have done anyway, frankly, that you be assigned
     to'an institution that has a program of substance abuse
     cou?,seling and'treatment and a program of mental health
     counse1,inb and treatment that hopefully will help you
     to deal with1 these problems while you are in prison.
     But they'll only help you if you want to be helped.
     Nobody can make you be helped.             It has to come from
     you.    And you've got an opportunity here, and you will
     have an opportunity to deal with those problems so that
     when you get out, you can turn things around.
               Following the completion of your sentence, I
     place you on a supervised release for a period of three
     years.     And as a condition of your supervised release,
     I will require that you undergo a program of substance
     abuse counseling and treatment and mental health
     counseling and treatment, either inpatient or
     outpatient, to be determined by the probation
     department, and that's for your own good, because if
     you haven't dealt with the problem by the time you get
     out of prison, you'll have an incentive or you'll be
     required to continue working on that after you get out.
               I'm not going to impose any fine, because it
     doesn't appear that you have any assets with which to
     pay a fine, but I am required to impose a special

       assessme'nt in the amount of $100.           You may be seated,
       Mr. Quinones.                                             a        t




   !
              THE COURT:      Is there anything further,
       Mr. Neronha?
              MR. NERONHA:       No, your,Honor, thank you.
              THE COURT:      Mr. Thompson?
              MR. THOMPSON:       Your Honor, I'd ask the Court to
       make a recommendation that Mr. Quinones receive credit
       back to July 9, that's the day he was arrested on the
       parallel state charges.
              THE COURT:      Well, my understanding is he's
       facing some violations.         He's been incarcerated not
       only because of the pending state charge, but also
       because that charge is the basis for some violations.
              MR. THOMPSON:       That's correct, your Honor.
              THE COURT:       So I don't think it's appropriate in
       this case, not being able to sort those out.                  The
       violations relate to entirely separate matters, so I
       don't think it would be appropriate to make that
       recommendation in this case.
             Court will be in recess.
