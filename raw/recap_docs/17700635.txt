STATEMENT OF REASONS

VII COURT DETERMINATIONS OF RESTITUTION

A mr RestitutionNotApplicable

B Tota| Amount of Restitution:

C Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

l jj For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 U.S.C, § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

2 \:I F or offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 U.S.C. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex

issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims’ losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U,S.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(B)_

3 1:] F or other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not

ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh
the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(l)(B)(ii).

4 ij Restitution is not ordered for other reasons (Explat'n.)
