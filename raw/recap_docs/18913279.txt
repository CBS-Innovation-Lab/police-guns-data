                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                         DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                   Criminal No. 03-cr-192-01-PB

Sheldon Grant


                                  O R D E R

     On August 12, 2009, defendant appeared for a “probable

cause” hearing under Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.1 on two alleged

violations of conditions of supervision.           Because the subject of

the alleged criminal threatening did not appear, the state court

dismissed the charge and the government is unable to establish

probable cause here.       Defendant waived the preliminary hearing on

the second charge.       I therefore find probable cause to hold him

for a revocation hearing as to the second charge.

     Defendant sought bail conditions under Rule 32.1(a)(6).

Under Rule 32.1(a)(6) defendant bears the burden of establishing

by clear and convincing evidence that he will not flee and that

he poses no danger to any other person or to the community.              Here

defendant has been thrown out of the halfway house barely a month

after entry for possessing gang-related materials.             He has had

two prior revocations for domestic violence committed within a

month of release, and he was charged with a similar threat again

within a month of the last release.           He is a danger to the

community.   There are no conditions which are likely to assure

his presence and the safety of the community.

      Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the defendant be detained

pending trial.

      The defendant is committed to the custody of the Attorney

General or his designated representative for confinement in a

corrections facility separate, to the extent practicable, from

persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody

pending appeal.     The defendant shall be afforded a reasonable

opportunity for private consultation with defense counsel.             On

order of a court of the United States or on request of an

attorney for the government, the person in charge of the

corrections facility shall deliver the defendant to the United

States Marshal for the purpose of an appearance in connection

with a court proceeding.

      SO ORDERED.
