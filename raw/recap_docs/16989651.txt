                          ORDER AFFIRMING THE
               RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE


       The United States Magistrate Judge filed with the Court on January 9, 2006, his
Recommended Decision (Docket No. 52). Defendant filed its Objection to the Recommended
Decision (Docket No. 55) on January 27, 2006. The Government filed its response to Objection
(Docket No. 56) on February 13, 2006.
       I have reviewed and considered the Magistrate Judge's Recommended Decision, together
with the entire record; I have made a de novo determination of all matters adjudicated by the
Magistrate Judge's Recommended Decision; and I concur with the recommendations of the United
States Magistrate Judge for the reasons set forth in his Recommended Decision, and determine that
no further proceeding is necessary.


       1.        It is therefore ORDERED that the Amended Recommended Decision of the
                 Magistrate Judge is hereby AFFIRMED.

       2.        Defendantâ€™s Motion to Suppress (Docket No. 29) is DENIED.
