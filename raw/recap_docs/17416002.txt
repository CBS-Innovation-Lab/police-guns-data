              ORDER ON DEFENDANT’S MOTION TO DISMISS INDICTMENT

         Plaintiff contends that emergency hospitalization for a mental illness cannot qualify as

“committed to a mental institution” for purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(4) without making the

word “commitment” unconstitutionally vague and violating the Second Amendment. The Court

denies the motion.

I.       STATEMENT OF FACTS1

         On April 22, 2009, Brian Murphy was involuntarily hospitalized after he attempted

suicide. Application for Emergency Involuntary Admission to a Mental Hospital Ex. A (Docket

# 24).    Consistent with Maine law, three steps were taken to ensure Mr. Murphy needed

hospitalization. 34-B M.R.S.A. § 3863. First, a psychiatric clinician filled-out and signed an

application for emergency committal or “blue paper,”2 describing why she believed Mr. Murphy

was mentally ill and posed a likelihood of serious harm. Id. at § 3863(1). Second, a physician

certified that she examined Mr. Murphy on the date of the certification and agreed that Mr.

Murphy was mentally ill and posed a likelihood of serious harm. Id. at § 3863(2). Third, a

  “Blue paper” is the short hand parlance for emergency involuntary admission applications in Maine because
historically the three part forms were printed on blue paper. United States v. Smith, 511 F.3d 77, 79 n.1 (1st Cir.
2007) (citing United States v. Flanders, Crim. No. 03-76-B-W, 2004 WL 444027, at *2 n.1 (D. Me. Mar. 4, 2004)).

judicial officer, here the Chief Judge of the Maine District Court, certified that the application

complied with Maine law. Id. at § 3863(3).3

         On April 27, 2009 the hospital moved to formally commit Mr. Murphy through 34-B

M.R.S.A. § 3864‟s hearing process. Mot. and Order for Dismissal Ex. C (Docket # 24).4 On

April 29, 2009, the State informed Mr. Murphy of the hospital‟s intentions. Notice of Hearing,

Order to Examine, and Appointment of Counsel Ex. B (Docket # 24). This notice, entitled

Notice of Hearing, Order to Examine and Appointment of Counsel, stated in part:

         If an Order of Involuntary Commitment is ultimately entered in this case, the
         patient would be considered a “prohibited person” and may not own, possess, or
         have under that person‟s control a firearm pursuant to Title 15, Section 393,
         Subsection 1.

Id. On that same day, however, Eric Kuntz, M.D., interim Chief Medical Officer of Acadia

Hospital, moved that the pending application be dismissed because “the said patient may be

discharged from involuntary hospitalization with safety.” Mot. and Order for Dismissal Ex. C.

The state court granted the motion on April 30, 2009. Id. On June 2, 2009, Mr. Murphy was

arrested for having a gun at the Bangor Mall and on October 14, 2009, he was indicted under 18

U.S.C. § 922(g)(4) for possession of a gun by someone “who has been committed to a mental

institution.” Indictment (Docket # 1). Mr. Murphy‟s sole commitment was his emergency

hospitalization in April 2009.

         On December 16, 2009, Mr. Murphy moved to dismiss the indictment under both the

Second and Fifth Amendments. Def.’s Mot. to Dismiss (Docket # 24) (Mot. to Dismiss). The

Government responded on January 5, 2010. Gov’t’s Resp. to Def.’s Mot. to Dismiss (Docket #

  Maine law requires that a physician or psychologist examine the patient within 24 hours of admission. Either the
patient is again certified as suffering from a mental illness and posing a likelihood of serious harm or the patient is
immediately discharged. § 3863(7). The record does not contain any information about this second certification.
4
  Section 3863(5)(B)(2) states that the application for commitment “must be filed within 3 days from the date of
admission of the patient under this section, except that, if the 3rd day falls on a weekend or holiday, the application
must be filed on the next business day.” Normally the hospital would have had to file its application on April 25,
2009. However, because April 25, 2009 was a Saturday, the hospital submitted its application on April 27.

31) (Gov’t’s Resp.). Mr. Murphy replied to the Government on January 19, 2010. Def.’s Reply

to Gov’t’s Resp. to Def.’s Mot. to Dismiss (Docket # 36) (Def.’s Reply).

        A.       34-B M.R.S.A. § 3863 and 34-B M.R.S.A. § 3864

        As Mr. Murphy‟s experience demonstrates, Maine law has two separate procedures for

hospitalization when there is concern that a patient poses a likelihood of serious harm because of

a mental illness. Section 3863 allows for emergency hospitalization based on the asserted belief

by an applicant and a doctor‟s certification. This ex parte procedure provides no opportunity for

the patient to respond, but the patient can only be held temporarily. After three days, the hospital

must either release the patient or move to continue the period of commitment. 34-B M.R.S.A. §

3863(5)(B)(2).5

        Section 3864, on the other hand, allows for long-term commitment: the patient can be

committed for up to 4 months after the first hearing and a period not to exceed one year after all

subsequent hearings. 34-B M.R.S.A. § 3864(7). However, commitment under § 3864 is allowed

only after a formal hearing during which the patient is afforded extensive procedural rights,

including access to an attorney; the ability to testify, present witnesses, and cross-examine; and

the right to appeal. Id. at § 3864(5).

        B.       18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(4), Chamberlain, and Holt

        Section 922(g)(4) makes it unlawful for anyone “who has been adjudicated as a mental

defective or who has been committed to a mental institution” to possess a gun. The ban is

without exception and is effectively permanent.6



5
  Although the statute allows for three days, the temporary hospitalization need not end on a weekend or a holiday.
34-B M.R.S.A. § 3863(5)(B)(2). In such instances, as happened here, the patient can be held until the next business
day. Id.

  Under 18 U.S.C. § 925(c) a person previously committed to a mental institution can petition the Attorney General
for relief from the firearm ban. Since 1992, however, Congress has prohibited the use of appropriated funds for
investigating and acting on such petitions. United States v. Booker, 570 F. Supp. 2d 161, 164 n.2 (D. Me. 2008).

         Congress did not define the phrase “committed to a mental institution,” and in United

States v. Chamberlain, the First Circuit grappled with the phrase‟s definition in the context of an

emergency commitment under Maine law. 159 F.3d 656, 658 (1st Cir. 1998). Like Mr. Murphy,

the defendant in Chamberlain had been hospitalized pursuant to 34-B M.R.S.A. § 3863. A

clinician filed an application for involuntary commitment; a physician certified, after

examination, that the defendant posed a danger of serious harm due to mental illness; and a

Maine District Court judge endorsed the application and ordered him admitted to Acadia

Hospital for no more than five days, the maximum length of time of an emergency detention

under § 3863. Id. at 657.7 Within 24-hours of Mr. Chamberlain‟s admission, a second physician

certified that he was mentally ill and posed a likelihood of serious harm. Eleven months later,

Mr. Chamberlain was found with a firearm, and he was subsequently indicted for violating 18

U.S.C. § 922(g)(4). Mr. Chamberlain contended that “he had not, as a matter of law been

„committed to a mental institution‟ within the meaning of § 922(g)(4).” Id. at 658.

         The First Circuit rejected the defendant‟s argument “that a person can be deemed

„committed‟ under Maine law for purposes of the federal firearms ban only after notice and

issuance by a state judge of a formal order of commitment following a full hearing at which the

person has had the opportunity to be heard.” Id. at 661.8 The First Circuit concluded that it did

not appear that “Congress intended that only those persons conclusively found to be suffering


7
  Section 3863 allows for a three-day emergency detention. Presumably, the defendant, like Mr. Murphy, was
ordered hospitalized on a Thursday, effectively pushing his day of release back two additional days.
8
  Mr. Chamberlain also argued that Maine state law distinguished between an “involuntary admission” under the
emergency procedures and a “commitment” under longer-term detention. Id. at 661. Observing that whether a
defendant is “committed” is a question of federal law, id. at 658, the First Circuit noted that “the proper
interpretation of the phrase „committed to a mental institution,‟ should not turn primarily on the label attached by the
state legislature to its procedure, but rather on the substance of those procedures.” Id. at 663. The First Circuit
concluded that the “procedures followed in this case, whether denominated as an „involuntary admission‟ or a
„commitment‟ by the Maine Legislature, constituted in all functional respects a „commitment‟ for purposes of §
922(g)(4).” Id. at 663.

from mental illnesses or difficulties after have been afforded the fullest possible panoply of due

process rights be deemed to have been „committed to a mental institution‟ for purposes of the

firearms ban.” Id. at 664.

        The First Circuit again addressed the Maine commitment statute in United States v. Holt.

464 F.3d 101 (1st Cir. 2006).         In Holt, a licensed clinical social worker applied for the

defendant‟s involuntary admission to a mental institution, and a psychiatrist certified that he had

examined the defendant and that the defendant posed a “likelihood of serious harm due to a

mental illness.” Id. at 102. The next day, a Maine District Judge reviewed the application and

authorized the county sheriffs to transport the defendant to a medical facility. What happened

next is unclear, but within a couple of months, the defendant was no longer in a medical facility

and was in possession of a firearm. Id. He was indicted for violating 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(4) and

after a jury trial, found guilty. Id. at 103.

        On appeal, the defendant challenged whether he had ever been committed within the

meaning of § 922(g)(4). He contended that a commitment occurs “only after an application for

involuntary commitment has been approved by a state judge, the person has been taken to a

medical facility, and a follow-up examination has been performed within 24 hours of the

involuntary admission.”      Id. at 102-03.     In Holt, there was no evidence that a follow-up

examination had taken place. The First Circuit stated that “[w]e do not think that the existence

of a 24-hour examination makes a difference in the outcome, nor did Chamberlain suggest it

should.” Id. at 105. The Court explained that in Chamberlain, “at the time the judicial order was

issued, and before the second examination had occurred, Chamberlain was ordered „detained in a

mental institution for five days‟ based on a judicial order that this was in accordance with law.

This process meets the ordinary definition of „commitment‟ embraced in Chamberlain.” Id. The

Court concluded that “the term „committed‟ in the statute refers to a judicial (or possibly an

administrative) order of commitment and does not depend on the ultimate outcome of the

commitment.” Id.

II.    DISCUSSION

       A.     Vagueness

              1.   The Defendant’s Vagueness Argument

       Mr. Murphy‟s vagueness argument turns on the meaning of the word “committed.”

Relying on the Supreme Court cases Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418 (1979) and Vitek v. Jones,

445 U.S. 480 (1980), Mr. Murphy says that “committed” must refer only to a commitment that

followed proceedings that accorded the person a panoply of rights. Mot. to Dismiss at 6-7. Mr.

Murphy contends that because he was involuntarily admitted to a hospital without any due

process rights, what happened to him during the Maine blue papering process cannot be deemed

“committed” under federal law. Id.

       Mr. Murphy acknowledges that Chamberlain found the process in Maine was a

commitment under § 924(g)(4). Id. However, he asserts that the First Circuit was not asked to

address the question he has raised here. He notes that the defendant in Chamberlain argued that

the “procedure set out for an emergency admission pursuant to a “Blue Paper” was not the

equivalent to a “commitment” for purposes of § 924(g)(4)” and that the First Circuit “rejected

this argument by finding that Congress had not defined the term „commitment‟ and that the

dictionary meaning of that term renders an „involuntary admission‟ under section 3863 to seem

no different from a „commitment.‟” Id. at 7 (quoting Chamberlain, 159 F.3d at 661) (quotations

omitted). But he insists the First Circuit was never asked to address whether a “commitment”




                                              6
Case 1:09-cr-00157-JAW Document 38 Filed 02/03/10 Page 7 of 14                                    PageID #: 128



without Addington-Vitek due process rights was a “commitment” within the meaning of the

federal statute, and the appellate court never ruled on this issue.9

         Having framed the legal backdrop, Mr. Murphy turns to his main argument: since the

Supreme Court defined “commitment” in a fashion that would not include the process Mr.

Murphy underwent and the First Circuit defined “commitment” in a fashion that would, the

inconsistent use of the same term “renders the meaning of „commitment‟ constitutionally vague.”

Mot. to Dismiss at 9.

                  2.   Unconstitutional Vagueness

         A statute is unconstitutionally vague “only if it „prohibits . . . an act in terms so uncertain

that persons of average intelligence would have no choice but to guess at its meaning and modes

of application.‟” United States v. Nieves-Castano, 480 F.3d 597, 603 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting

United States v. Councilman, 418 F.3d 67, 84 (1st Cir. 2005)); see also Welch v. United States,

750 F.2d 1101, 1112 (1st Cir. 1985) (“All due process requires is that a statutory prohibition be

„…set out in terms that the ordinary person exercising ordinary common sense can sufficiently

understand and comply with.‟”) (quoting Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134, 159 (1974)). Here,

the statute adequately put Mr. Murphy on notice that “commitment to a mental institution”

would include emergency hospitalization under Maine law and the Supreme Court has not

provided an inconsistent definition.

                           a.   Readily Evident Meaning

         The First Circuit in Chamberlain gave “commitment” its ordinary meaning: it found

Maine‟s emergency admission procedure qualified under § 922 based on the dictionary definition


9
  Mr. Murphy puts the matter less delicately. He states that “the First Circuit entirely missed the fact that the
Supreme Court had held that there can be no constitutionally valid „commitment‟ without the notice, appointment of
counsel, and right to cross examination set forth in [Addington] and later re-affirmed in [Vitek].” Mot. to Dismiss at
7-8.

                                                          7
Case 1:09-cr-00157-JAW Document 38 Filed 02/03/10 Page 8 of 14                  PageID #: 129



of “commitment.” Chamberlain, 159 F.3d at 661. In Holt, the First Circuit refined Chamberlain

and concluded that for purposes of §922(g)(4), a person was “committed” upon the issuance of a

“judicial (or possibly administrative) order of commitment.” Holt, 464 F.3d at 105. Because

“the evaluation of the constitutionality of the statute is also made in light of judicial

constructions of the statute,” Nieves-Castano, 480 F.3d at 603 (citations omitted), the clear

holding in Chamberlain and the refinement in Holt removes any doubt that hospitalization under

§ 3863 qualifies as “commitment” under § 922(g)(4). In accordance with clear First Circuit

precedent, when the Maine District Judge signed the emergency commitment order, Mr. Murphy

was “committed” under § 922(g)(4).

       Statutory context is consistent with the First Circuit‟s construction. Because Congress

banned firearm possession by those “adjudicated as mentally defective” separately from its ban

on those “committed to a mental institution,” Congress evidently intended to “cast a wider net.”

Id. at 664. “Requiring an adversary hearing and a judicial finding of mental illness would

conflate two of the categories Congress singled out for the firearms prohibition.”           Id.

Furthermore, Congress affirmatively requires minimum procedural protections before the firearm

ban is applied to perpetrators of domestic violence. 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(8). The absence of

similar protections with respect to determining who has been “committed to a mental institution”

implies none is required. Chamberlain, 159 F.3d at 665. Ordinary meaning, First Circuit

precedent, and statutory context provided ample notice that emergency hospitalization under

Maine law qualified as committed under § 922(g)(8).

                      b. Treatment by the Supreme Court

       The Supreme Court has not provided an alternative definition for the phrase “committed

to a mental institution.” The word “committed” is not a term of art for civil commitment



                                               8
Case 1:09-cr-00157-JAW Document 38 Filed 02/03/10 Page 9 of 14                                    PageID #: 130



procedures that comport with the due process requirements of Addington. In Addington, the

Supreme Court addressed the minimum constitutional procedures required before “indefinite

commitment.” 441 U.S. at 420 (emphasis added). Rather than holding that all commitments

automatically required notice, appointment of counsel, and right to cross examination, the

Supreme Court carefully delineated how the term was used: the appellant had been “committed

temporarily” in the past and now he contested his “indefinite commitment.” Id.10

         After Addington, courts have upheld state laws that allow temporary commitment without

the Addington procedural protections. Simon v. Cook, 261 Fed. Appx. 873 (6th Cir. 2008)

(stating that “[t]he omission of legal counsel and the right to call witnesses makes sense since the

decision to hospitalize is being made in response to an immediate presentment of an individual

and is only going to last 72 hours”); Jensen v. Lane County, 312 F.3d 1145 (9th Cir. 2002)

(rejecting defendant‟s argument that the lack of a civil commitment hearing before a 5-day

involuntary admission violated his due process rights); Rodriguez v. City of New York, 72 F.3d

1051 (2d Cir. 1995) (same). Although recognizing that all involuntary civil commitments must

comport with the requirements of due process, the Ninth Circuit in Jenson distinguished between

the procedures required for long-term involuntary commitment and short-term emergency

commitment.        Id. at 1146-48.         In essence, the Jenson Court recognized that the word

“commitment” encompasses both “temporary hospitalization” and “long-term commitment

requiring due process proceedings.” The qualifier, such as “temporary” or “indefinite,” not the

word “commitment,” determines the scope of constitutionally mandated due process.

                           c. State Law Definitions and First Circuit Authority



10
  In Vitek v. Jones, the Supreme Court addressed the procedural rights to be accorded a state prisoner before being
involuntarily transferred for treatment from prison to a state mental hospital. 445 U.S. 480, 482 (1980). There is no
suggestion that the transfer was an emergency.

         Mr. Murphy seeks to infuse confusion into the definition of “committed” by arguing that

Maine state law only “considers the [§ 3864] proceeding that was dismissed against Mr. Murphy

to be a „commitment.‟” Mot. to Dismiss at 9.11 The First Circuit has already twice rejected this

argument. In Chamberlain, the First Circuit clarified that the definition of “commitment” is a

question of federal, not state law, and that the definition included the emergency involuntary

hospitalization procedure that was followed here. Chamberlain, 159 F.3d at 663. In Holt, the

First Circuit reaffirmed its holding in Chamberlain that “the substance of the mental institute

admission procedures, rather than the label of the procedures as a „commitment,‟ is controlling

for the federal statute.” Holt, 464 F.3d at 105.

         Moreover, the First Circuit has rejected the premise of Mr. Murphy‟s argument—that

Maine state law recognizes a difference between an “involuntary admission” and a

“commitment.” Chamberlain, 159 F.3d at 661. In Chamberlain, the First Circuit expressly

stated: “We find no evidence, however, that the Maine Legislature consciously used the

11
   In support of his position, Mr. Murphy writes that “[i]t is because the Supreme Court has supplied the definition
as to what a constitutionally permitted „commitment‟ must involve, as opposed to the definition proved by the First
Circuit in Chamberlain that renders the statute impermissibly vague.” Mot. to Dismiss at 8 (emphasis supplied).
Mr. Murphy explains that “[t]he Second Circuit noted that two other circuits had relied on state law procedure that
separated emergency admissions from formal commitment proceedings (as does Maine) and had found that a person
emergently admitted but not later subject to an adversary hearing did not meet the federal definition of
„commitment.‟” Id. at 8-9 (citing United States v. Waters, 23 F.3d 29, 31 (2d Cir. 1994); United States v. Giardina,
861 F.2d 1334, 1335 (5th Cir. 1988); United States v. Hansel, 474 F.2d 1120, 1122-23 (8th Cir. 1973)).
          First, it is the First Circuit, not the Second, Fifth or Eighth, to which this Court owes direct allegiance.
Eulitt v. Me. Dep’t of Educ., 386 F.3d 344, 349 (1st Cir. 2004) (stating that “[u]ntil a court of appeals revokes a
binding precedent, a district court within the circuit is hard put to ignore that precedent unless it has unmistakably
been cast into disrepute by supervening authority”). Although the Court has the ability to follow clearly intervening
Supreme Court authority, the First Circuit issued Chamberlain and Holt after Addington and Vitek so Mr. Murphy‟s
argument amounts to the contention that the First Circuit erred, a proposition Mr. Murphy is free to argue, but not a
proposition this Court is free to accept.
          Second, the First Circuit viewed its approach as “similar to the analysis in Waters.” Chamberlain, 159 F.3d
at 663. The Chamberlain Court interpreted Waters as not following the label attached by the state legislature: “these
procedures whether termed an „admission‟ or a „commitment‟ [by the legislature] . . . established „commitment‟
procedures under New York State law, and Waters was „committed‟ pursuant to those procedures.” Id. at 663
(quoting Waters, 23 F.3d at 34) (quotations omitted). So, as analyzed by the First Circuit, Waters stands against Mr.
Murphy‟s argument, not for it.
          Finally, in Chamberlain, the First Circuit discussed both Giardina and Hansel and declined to follow them.
Chamberlain, 159 F.3d at 662 (stating that “we respectfully decline to follow the approach of Giardina and

„involuntary admission‟ language to distinguish between that and a „commitment.‟ To the

contrary, the legislature has used the terms „admission‟ and „commitment‟ interchangeably.” Id.

       In sum, there is no authority for the proposition that Maine state law treats an admission

differently than a commitment or for the contention that the Maine emergency involuntary

commitment procedure under § 3863 is not a commitment under § 922(g)(4).

                      d. Vagueness and Mr. Murphy

       The record in this case reveals that on April 22, 2009, a psychiatric clinician signed an

“Application for Emergency Involuntary Admission to a Mental Hospital.” Application for

Emergency Involuntary Admission to a Mental Hospital Ex. A. The application stated that Mr.

Murphy had attempted suicide by overdosing on a bottle of sleep medication and drinking

whiskey. Id. A licensed medical doctor examined Mr. Murphy and expressed the opinion that

he had a mental illness that posed a substantial risk of physical harm to himself. Id. She

certified that an ambulance was the least restrictive form of transportation that meets the

patient‟s clinical needs. Id. The application was taken before a state of Maine District Court

Judge, and on April 22, 2009 at 6:50 a.m., the Judge issued the following order:

       Upon review pursuant to 34-B M.R.S.A. § 3863(3), I find this application and
       certificate to be regular and in accordance with the law, and I hereby authorize
       Any Ambulance Service to take Brian Murphy into custody and transport him or
       her to Acadia Mental Hospital.

Id. A week later another Judge of the Maine District Court issued the Notice of Hearing, Order

to Examine and Appointment of Counsel, requiring Mr. Murphy to undergo a psychological

examination on May 5 and scheduling a hearing for May 8, 2009. Notice of Hearing, Order to

Examine, and Appointment of Counsel Ex. B.

       Legal arguments sometimes assume an otherworldly air, and real life experiences get lost

in definitional subtleties. Although neither the Defendant‟s nor Government‟s memorandum

confirms all the underlying details, the Court infers that the State Judge‟s April 22, 2009 Order

was complied with, that Mr. Murphy was taken pursuant to judicial fiat to a psychiatric hospital,

was held at the hospital for a period long enough for a psychological evaluation to take place,

and was allowed to leave the hospital only after the District Judge granted the motion to dismiss

the application for emergency commitment on April 30, 2009. To be ambulanced pursuant to

court order to a psychiatric hospital, detained there for psychiatric evaluation, and released only

when a judge signed a further order would place the ordinarily reasonable citizen on notice that

he or she had been involuntarily committed within the meaning of the law.12

        B.       Second Amendment

        Mr. Murphy addresses “the level of process that is due before a person is labeled as one

who, due to mental incapacity, has lost an individual right otherwise conferred by the

Constitution.” Mot. to Dismiss at 10. Mr. Murphy argues that the Second Amendment right to

bear arms, recognized in Heller, can only be deprived after mental status is determined by

adjudication. District of Columbia v. Heller, 128 S. Ct. 2783 (2008). In other words, because

erratic behavior can stem from either mental illness or misinterpreted abnormal behavior, Mr.

Murphy contends that Addington procedures are necessary to ensure that § 922(g)(4) is

“narrowly tailored to address the harm sought to be avoided.” Def.’s Reply at 7.13




12
   Although not considered for purposes of this motion, the Government alleges that Mr. Murphy admitted that he in
fact knew he was not allowed to possess a gun. His alleged concession dovetails with the Court‟s common sense
assessment.
13
   Mr. Murphy appears to make a hybrid argument. Although arguing under an intermediate level of review, he asks
the Court to find that certain minimal procedural protections are necessary to prevent the non-mentally ill or the
non-dangerous mentally ill from being wrongly deprived of their Second Amendment rights. A threshold question,
however, is whether the procedural rights afforded by the Fifth Amendment apply to the Second. Constitutional
rights do not necessarily yield due process rights and no other court has afforded procedural protections to the
Second Amendment. Until the Supreme Court or the First Circuit extends due process rights to the Second
Amendment, the Court does not reach the merits of the due process aspects of Mr. Murphy‟s argument.

       Mr. Murphy argues that procedural protections are relevant to whether § 922(g)(4) is

narrowly tailored to the goal of preventing possession by the mentally ill who pose a threat of

harm. He contends that absent a hearing to determine actual dangerousness, “the Government

has not established that Mr. Murphy falls within a class of those who are „inherently dangerous‟

due to a mental illness.” Def.’s Reply at 7. Although Chamberlain found that commitment

under § 3863 was sufficiently related to dangerousness, Ms. Murphy contends Chamberlain is

not controlling because it was written before Heller and decided under rational review. Mr.

Murphy argues that hospitalization under § 3863 is not sufficiently related under the intermediate

or strict scrutiny that applies post-Heller. The Court disagrees for two reasons.

       First, the Court takes Heller at its word that “nothing in our opinion should be taken to

cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally

ill.” Heller, 128 S. Ct. at 2816-17. Based on this language, this Court in Booker found it

unnecessary to delineate the appropriate level of scrutiny for the prohibition of firearm

possession by those convicted of misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence. Booker, 570 F.

Supp. 2d at 163 (finding the misdemeanor crime of domestic violence sufficiently similar to

possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill “to justify its inclusion in the list of

„longstanding prohibitions‟ that survive Second Amendment scrutiny”). The Court‟s conclusion

in Booker applies with more force given Heller‟s express reference to the mentally ill.

       The First Circuit has also intimated that groups subject to “longstanding prohibitions”

against gun possession might not have full Second Amendment rights. United States v. Rene E.,

583 F.3d 8 (1st Cir. 2009). In Rene E., the First Circuit concluded that, based on longstanding

prohibitions against firearm possession by juveniles, “the right to keep arms in the founding

period did not extend to juveniles.” Id. at 16; see also United States v. Skoien, 587 F.3d 803, 809



                                                13
Case 1:09-cr-00157-JAW Document 38 Filed 02/03/10 Page 14 of 14                                PageID #: 135



n.3 (7th Cir. 2009) (describing the holding in Rene E. as “[t]he court concluded that the

founding-era understanding of the Second Amendment right likely excluded juvenile handgun

possession from the scope of the right”). Prohibitions against firearm possession by mental

incompetents are as long-standing. Id. at 15-16 (describing historical prohibitions against gun

possession by juveniles and the mentally ill as similar); cf. Skoien, 587 F.3d at 810 (basing

conclusion that misdemeanants had not forfeited Second Amendment rights on the lack of

argument by the government and the inconsistent historical treatment).

        Second, Mr. Murphy‟s argument relies on a distinction between emergency and

adjudicated commitments that the First Circuit specifically found did not exist. Mr. Murphy

argues that a three-day emergency commitment cannot justify a life-long ban on gun possession

but accepts that adjudicated commitment can.14 In Chamberlain, however, the First Circuit

found temporary hospitalization under Maine law “implicates the potential for harm Congress

sought to regulate under the firearms ban.” Chamberlain, 159 F.3d at 665. Because the First

Circuit concluded that both forms of involuntary hospitalization under Maine law indicate the

same potential for future harm, this Court cannot now decide that they do not.

III.    CONCLUSION

        The Court DENIES Mr. Murphy‟s Motion to Dismiss (Docket # 24).

        SO ORDERED.

   A more precise description of Mr. Murphy‟s argument is that the lack of accuracy prevents a reasonable fit.
Accuracy, however, is a question of due process—an argument rejected above. Instead, the question of “reasonable
fit” asks whether, assuming that emergency hospitalization was necessary, such a temporary commitment justifies a
permanent ban on gun possession. In fairness to Mr. Murphy, the Court treats him as having also made this second
argument.
