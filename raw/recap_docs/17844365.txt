VII   COURT DETERMINATIONS OF RESTITUTION

      A      ~     Restitution Not Applicable.

      B      Total Amount of Restitution:

      C      Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

                   o	    For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 USC ~ 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
                         identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 USC ~ 3663A(c)(3)(A).

             2     o	    For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 USC ~ 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
                         issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of tile victims' losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
                         that the need 10 provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C ~ 3663A(c)(3)(B).

             3     o	   For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C ~ 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
                        ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh
                        the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U.S.c. § 3663(a)( I)(B)(ii).

             4     o	    Restitution is not ordered for other reasons. (Explain)




      D      0     Partial restitution is ordered for these reasons (/8 USC § 3553(c)) :




VIII ADDITIONAL FACTS JUSTIFYING THE SENTENCE IN THIS CASE (If applicable.)
 Given the nature and extent of the defendant's cooperation and the sentences of codefendants who did not cooperate , and

 given the pendency of New Jersey cases where other conduct may be addressed more specifically, the sentence is

 sufficient but no greater than necessary to serve the purposes of § 3553 .
