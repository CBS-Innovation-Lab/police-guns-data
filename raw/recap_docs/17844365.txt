      A      ~     Restitution Not Applicable.

      B      Total Amount of Restitution:

      C      Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

                   o	    For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 USC ~ 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
                         identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 USC ~ 3663A(c)(3)(A).

             2     o	    For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 USC ~ 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
                         issues of fact and relating them to the cause or amount of tile victims' losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
                         that the need 10 provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 U.S.C ~ 3663A(c)(3)(B).

             3     o	   For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 U.S.C ~ 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
                        ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh
                        the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 U.S.c. ยง 3663(a)( I)(B)(ii).

             4     o	    Restitution is not ordered for other reasons. (Explain)




      D      0     Partial restitution is ordered for these reasons (/8 USC ยง 3553(c)) :




VIII ADDITIONAL FACTS JUSTIFYING THE SENTENCE IN THIS CASE (If applicable.)
 Given the nature and extent of the defendant's cooperation and the sentences of codefendants who did not cooperate , and

 given the pendency of New Jersey cases where other conduct may be addressed more specifically, the sentence is

 sufficient but no greater than necessary to serve the purposes of ยง 3553 .
