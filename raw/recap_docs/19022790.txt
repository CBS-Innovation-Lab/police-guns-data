            UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                    DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America,
     Plaintiff

          v.
                                       Case N o .   12-cr-167-01/03-SM

Thomas J. Dunn, Quentin Simon,
And Willie Ortiz,
     Defendants

                               O R D E R


     Defendant Dunn’s Assented-to Motion to Continue the final

pretrial conference and trial for at least 90 days(document n o .

20) is granted.    Trial has been rescheduled for the month of

June 2013. Defendant Dunn shall file a waiver of speedy trial

rights on March 1 4 , 2013.

     The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting

a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendants in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A) and ( B ) ,

in that failure to grant a continuance would unreasonably deny

the defendants the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence

under the circumstances.

     Final Pretrial Conference is rescheduled for June 7 , 2013

at 2:00 p.m.
