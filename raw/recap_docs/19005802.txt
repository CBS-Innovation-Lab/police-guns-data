                      UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                   FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

   v.                                   Criminal No. 12-mj-047-01-LM

Jody P. Albert



                   ORDER OF DETENTION PENDING TRIAL


    In accordance with 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f), a hearing was

conducted on June 14, 2012, to determine whether to detain the

defendant, Jody P. Albert, who has been charged by complaint

with possession a firearm by a prohibited person, in violation

of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1).     The court issued its detention order

orally from the bench, and this written order incorporates by

reference those findings and rulings.         See 18 U.S.C. §

3142(i)(1).



                            Legal Standards

    Section 3142(f) of the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3141-

3156, “does not authorize a detention hearing whenever the

government thinks detention would be desirable, but rather

limits such hearings” to the circumstances listed in 18 U.S.C. §

3142(f)(1) and (f)(2).     United States v. Ploof, 851 F.2d 7, 10

(1st Cir. 1988).    In this case, the government argued that a
       Case 1:12-cr-00089-PB Document 7 Filed 06/14/12 Page 2 of 4




detention hearing was warranted under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f)(1)(E)

(felony involving possession or use of a firearm).         The charges

in this case satisfy the above parameters and, accordingly, the

detention hearing was appropriately requested under ' 3142(f).

     Pursuant to § 3142(f), the court must determine whether any

condition or combination of conditions set forth in § 3142(c)

will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant (“risk of

flight”) and the safety of any other person and the safety of

the community (“dangerousness”).       18 U.S.C. § 3142(f); United

States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d 789, 791 (1st Cir. 1991).          In

making this determination, the court must consider the

following:   (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense

charged; (2) the weight of the evidence as to guilt; (3) the

history and characteristics of the accused, including family

ties, past history, financial resources and employment; and (4)

the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the

community that would be posed by a release.        18 U.S.C. § 3142(g)

     During the course of a hearing conducted pursuant to 18

U.S.C. § 3142, the government has the burden of persuading the

court that no condition or combination of conditions will

reasonably assure (1) the defendant’s presence at trial, United

States v. Perez-Franco, 839 F.2d 867, 870 (1st Cir. 1988); or

(2) the safety of another or the community.        Patriarca, 948 F.2d



                                   2

at 793.    For its part, the government is required to prove risk

of flight by a preponderance of the evidence and to establish

dangerousness by clear and convincing evidence.            See id. at 792-

93.


                           Findings and Rulings

      In the instant case, the government argued that defendant

is not a flight risk but is a serious danger to the community.

After weighing the evidence and balancing the factors laid out

in 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g), the court finds that the government met

its burden of proving dangerousness.          The court issued its

ruling and explained its rationale orally from the bench.               The

court incorporates its oral ruling herein, and for the reasons

stated on the record, finds that the government met its burden

of proving that defendant’s release, even on strict conditions,

presents too serious a risk danger.         There are no conditions or

combination of conditions that will reasonably assure the safety

of the community.      Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the defendant

be detained pending trial.

      The defendant is committed to the custody of the Attorney

General or his designated representative for confinement in a

correctional facility, to be held separately, to the extent

practicable, from persons awaiting or serving sentences or being

held in custody pending appeal.         The defendant shall be afforded

        Case 1:12-cr-00089-PB Document 7 Filed 06/14/12 Page 4 of 4




a reasonable opportunity for private consultation with defense

counsel.   On order of a court of the United States or on request

of an attorney for the government, the person in charge of the

correctional facility shall deliver the defendant to the United

States Marshal for the purpose of appearing in connection with

court proceedings.

      SO ORDERED.
