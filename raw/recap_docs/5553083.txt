             GOVERNMENT’S RESPONSE TO DEFENDANT’S
                 MOTION FOR REDUCTION OF SENTENCE

     The government hereby responds to the motion of defendant

Brandon Delgado (“Delgado”) for reduction of sentence pursuant to

18 U.S.C. §3582(c)(2) and USSG §1B1.10, as amended. The government

agrees that the Delgado is eligible for a reduction in his sentence

and agrees that his previously imposed sentence of 57 months should

be reduced to 46 months.1

     A.   Background

     On November 2, 2005, Delgado was charged in a superseding

indictment   with   eight    counts   of   possession    with    intent     to

distribute cocaine and cocaine base (a/k/a crack), in violation of

21 U.S.C. §841(a)(1), and one count of possession of a firearm in

furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C.

§924(c). On June 7, 2006, Delgado pled guilty to the drug charges,

and the government agreed to dismiss the §924(c) charge.            The plea

was tendered under Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1)(C), with the parties


     1
      The BOP web site discloses a projected release date for
Delgado of July 14, 2009. Accordingly, if this Court grants the
jointly requested reduction of 11 months, Delgado will be eligible
for release toward the end of this summer.

agreeing that the court should impose a sentence of “incarceration

within the range of 57 to 71 months, with each party free to

recommend a specific term of months within that range.”

        Three of the drug counts involved cocaine base, 6.24 grams in

total.       The remaining five counts involved powder cocaine, and

along with a small uncharged quantity of powder cocaine, totaled

11.67     grams.      Under     the   guidelines      applicable       at   time     of

sentencing, the base offense level (“BOL”) for 6.24 grams of

cocaine base was 26.        Using the drug equivalency table to combine

the cocaine base and the powder cocaine into equivalent quantities

of marijuana, the BOL for all of the drugs remained at 26.                      [PSR,

¶24].     Because Delgado was in possession of a firearm at the time

of the drug offenses, 2 levels were added to his BOL. [PSR, ¶25].

With     a    three   level      reduction      for     timely      acceptance       of

responsibility,       his   total     offense   level    was     25.    [PSR,   ¶31].

Delgado was found to be in criminal history category (“CHC”) II,

and his guideline sentencing range to be 63-78 months. [PSR, ¶110].

        At sentencing, the parties recommended and this Court imposed

a sentence of 57 months, or six months less that the low-end of the

applicable GSR.

        B.   Eligibility for a Sentence Reduction

        Section 3582(c)(2) of Title 18 of the United States

Code provides:

        [I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term
        of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has

                                         2
    Case 1:05-cr-10176-RCL   Document 56   Filed 04/11/2008   Page 3 of 7



     subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission
     pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or
     the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion,
     the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after
     considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the
     extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is
     consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the
     Sentencing Commission.

     In Section 1B1.10 of the Guidelines, the Sentencing Commission

has identified the amendments which may be applied retroactively

pursuant to this authority, and articulated the proper procedure

for implementing the amendment in a concluded case.2           On December

11, 2007, the Commission issued a revised version of §1B1.10, which

emphasizes the limited nature of relief available under 18 U.S.C.

§3582(c).   Revised §1B1.10(a), which becomes effective on March 3,

2008, provides, in relevant part:

     (1)    In General.—In a case in which a defendant is serving a
            term of imprisonment, and the guideline range applicable
            to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a


     2
      Section 1B1.10 is based on 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2), and also
implements 28 U.S.C. § 994(u), which provides: “If the Commission
reduces the term of imprisonment recommended in the guidelines
applicable to a particular offense or category of offenses, it
shall specify in what circumstances and by what amount the
sentences of prisoners serving terms of imprisonment for the
offense may be reduced.”

     A guideline amendment may be applied retroactively only when
expressly listed in Section 1B1.10(c). See, e.g., United States v.
Perez, 129 F.3d 255, 259 (2d Cir. 1997); United States v. Thompson,
70 F.3d 279, 281 (3d Cir. 1995); United States v. McHan, 386 F.3d
620, 622 (4th Cir. 2004); United States v. Drath, 89 F.3d 216, 218
(5th Cir. 1996); United States v. Dullen, 15 F.3d 68, 70-71 (6th
Cir. 1994); United States v. Wyatt, 115 F.3d 606, 608-09 (8th Cir.
1997); United States v. Cueto, 9 F.3d 1438, 1441 (9th Cir. 1993);
United States v. Avila, 997 F.2d 767, 768 (10th Cir. 1993); United
States v. Armstrong, 347 F.3d 905, 909 (11th Cir. 2003).

            result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in
            subsection (c) below, the court may reduce the
            defendant’s term of imprisonment as provided by 18 U.S.C.
            § 3582(c)(2). As required by 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2), any
            such reduction in the defendant’s term of imprisonment
            shall be consistent with this policy statement.

     (2)    Exclusions.—A reduction in the defendant’s term of
            imprisonment is not consistent with this policy statement
            and therefore is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. §
            3582(c)(2) if—

            (A)   none of the amendments listed in subsection (c) is
                  applicable to the defendant; or

            (B)   an amendment listed in subsection (c) does not have
                  the effect of lowering the defendant’s applicable
                  guideline range.

     (3)    Limitation.—Consistent with subsection (b), proceedings
            under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement do
            not constitute a full resentencing of the defendant.

     The amendment in question in this matter is Amendment 706,

effective November 1, 2007, which reduced the BOL levels for most

crack cocaine offenses (the “crack reduction amendment”).                      On

December    11,   2007,   the    Commission   added   the   crack    reduction

amendment to the list of amendments in §1B1.10(c) which may be

applied retroactively, effective March 3, 2008.

     In the crack reduction amendment, the Commission generally

reduced by two levels the BOL’s applicable to crack cocaine

offenses.    The Commission reasoned that, putting aside its stated

criticism of the 100:1 ratio applied by Congress to powder cocaine

and crack cocaine offenses in setting statutory mandatory minimum

penalties, the Commission could respect those mandatory penalties

while still reducing the BOL’s for crack offenses.                   See USSG,

                                       4
    Case 1:05-cr-10176-RCL   Document 56   Filed 04/11/2008   Page 5 of 7



Supplement to App. C, Amend. 706.

     Previously, the Commission had set the crack BOL’s in §2D1.1

above the range which included the mandatory minimum sentence.

Under the amendment, the Commission has set the BOL’s so that the

resulting guideline ranges include the mandatory minimum penalties

triggered by that amount, and then set corresponding BOL’s for

quantities which fall below, between, or above quantities which

trigger statutory mandatory minimum penalties.

     Delgado acknowledges, and the government agrees, that because

of an anomaly in the drug equivalency table, his total offense

level remains the same under the amended drug equivalency table,

even after the crack reduction amendment. Although in cocaine base

cases involving 5-20 grams of cocaine base, the old BOL would be

reduced from 26 to 24, the new drug equivalency table for 6.24

grams of crack and 11.67 grams of powder cocaine produces the same

BOL of 26 that existed before the crack reduction amendment.3               It

is an anomaly because if the 11.67 gram of powder cocaine in this

case was treated as cocaine base (the more serious of the two

drugs), the new BOL would be reduced two levels to 24.           It is only

because the 11.67 grams of powder cocaine is treated separately

under the drug equivalency table that the BOL is not reduced two


     3
      Under the drug equivalency table at the time of sentencing,
the powder cocaine had no effect on the BOL applicable to 6.24
grams of crack. The BOL was 26 based on the crack cocaine alone,
and was 26 based on combining the two drug quantities through the
drug equivalency table.

                                    5

levels. In the government’s view, the interests of justice require

that Delgado receive the intended benefit of the crack reduction

amendment,   and   his initial BOL should be set at 24.4                     With

adjustments for the firearm and acceptance of responsibility, his

total offense level should now be set at 23.        With a CHC of II, the

recalculated GSR should be found by this Court to be 51-63 months.

Because Delgado received a sentence below his advisory guideline

range at the time of his original sentencing, he is eligible for a

comparably   reduced    sentence    under    the    provisions      of       USSG

§1B1.10(b)(2)(B).      The government agrees with Delgado that an

additional five month reduction from the low-end of the 51-63 month

range is appropriate, and that this Court should enter an amended



     4
      Although the defendant qualifies for a reduction in sentence
under 18 U.S.C. §3582(c)(2), the government is of the view that, by
the express terms of both that section and USSG §1B1.10, “[t]he
grant of authority to the district court to reduce a term of
imprisonment is unambiguously discretionary,” even when the
guideline range is actually reduced. United States v. Vautier, 144
F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir. 1998). In determining whether and by how
much to reduce the defendant’s sentence, the government contends
that the Court must consider public safety considerations, and may
consider information regarding the post-sentencing conduct or
situation of the defendant, whether positive or negative. See USSG
§1B1.10, Revised application note 1(B)(ii) (“[t]he court shall
consider the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or
the community that may be posed by a reduction in the defendant’s
term of imprisonment”); Revised application note 1(B)(iii) (“[t]he
court may consider post-sentencing conduct of the defendant that
occurred after the imposition of the original term of
imprisonment”).    The government has no reason to believe that
considerations of public safety or the defendant’s conduct while in
the custody of the Bureau of Prisons warrant denial of the sentence
reduction to which Delgado is otherwise entitled.

judgment re-sentencing Delgado to 46 months imprison, with all

other aspect of the judgment to be reimposed.            In that way Delgado

will receive a sentence 11 months less than originally imposed, in

a case where, if a low-end sentence had originally been imposed,

and a two level reduction calculated, the benefit to Delgado would

have been 12 months.    In the government’s view, this Court can and

should   modify   Delgado’s    sentence     without    the   necessity     of   a

sentence modification hearing (or the defendant’s presence thereat)

and it should do so by issuing an order and amended judgment.
