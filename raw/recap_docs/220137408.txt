                                OPINION AND ORDER

BESOSA, District Judge.

        Defendants      Jairo    Huertas-Mercado    (“Huertas”)    and      Erick

Pizarro-Mercado (“Pizarro”) (collectively, “defendants”) move for

a judgment of acquittal of Count 1 of the Third Superseding

Indictment pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 (“Rule

29”). 1      (Docket Nos. 427 and 435.)         For the reasons set forth

below, the defendants’ Rule 29 motions are DENIED.

I.      Background

        Huertas and Pizarro committed a succession of violent crimes

within a span of 19 days, escalating from carjacking to kidnapping

and murder.        The trial testimony revealed that these defendants

terrorized unsuspecting victims for financial gain, to avenge the

 Defendant Huertas makes a general motion for acquittal “on all counts,” but
only argues that he be acquitted of the charge in Count 1.

death of a deceased relative, and to eliminate “enemies” of a drug

trafficking organization in the Lagos de Blasina public housing

project.    (Docket No. 413 at p. 69.)

     On February 11, 2020, a grand jury returned a seventeen-count

third-superseding indictment charging Huertas, Pizarro, Joshua

Luyando-González         (“Luyando”),        Kevin      Villegas-Carrasco

(“Villegas”), Wilkin Michael Cepeda-Colón (“Cepeda”), and Roberto

Meléndez-Hiraldo (“Meléndez”) with carjacking, kidnapping, and

brandishing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence

in violation of 18 U.S.C. sections 2119(1) and (2), 18 U.S.C.

sections 1201(1) and (2), and 18 U.S.C. sections 924(c)(1)(A)(ii)-

(iii) and 2, respectively.         (Docket No. 103.)       Count fourteen

charged Huertas, Pizarro, and Luyando with kidnapping resulting in

the death of Luis Sáenz-Martínez (“Sáenz”) in violation of 18

U.S.C. sections 1201(a)(1) and (2).        Id. at p. 8.

     On March 4, 2022, Luyando pled guilty to counts one and

fifteen    of   the   third-superseding    indictment     pursuant    to   an

agreement with the United States (carjacking and brandishing a

firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence).              (Docket

Nos. 329 and 330.) 2    Villegas pled guilty to counts one and three



2 He also pled guilty to count two of the second superseding indictment in

criminal action 18-516 (FAB) (brandishing a firearm during and in relation to
a crime of violence). See United States v. Luyando, Case No. 18-516, Docket
Nos. 179 and 335.)

of the third-superseding indictment (carjacking and brandishing a

firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence) pursuant to

a agreement with the United States on March 15, 2021.                  (Docket

No. 262.)     Huertas and Pizarro’s seven-day trial commenced on

September 9, 2022.        (Docket No. 402.)          Luyando and Villegas

testified as government witnesses. 3

      A.    The May 20, 2018 Carjacking: Counts 10 and 11

            Luyando, Cepeda, Huertas and Pizarro “decided to take a

[Toyota] Tacoma” from Carlos Cáez-Delgado (“Cáez”) in Naguabo,

Puerto Rico at approximately 11:00 PM on May 20, 2018.                 (Docket

No. 413 at p. 71.)       Huertas, Pizarro and Cepeda carried loaded

firearms, including an AK-47 rifle and two pistols. Id. at pp. 72-

73.   The defendants blocked the Tacoma on a one-way road, exited

their vehicle, and pointed a “long weapon” at Cáez.                    (Docket

No. 406 at p. 7; Docket No. 413 at p. 73.)               They subsequently

“threw [Cáez] to a grassy area” and frisked him.            (Docket No. 413

at p. 73.)

            The defendants referred to Cáez as “the one [they] were

looking for,” stating that they would shoot him if he moved.

(Docket No. 406 at p. 12.)      Cáez placed his hands behind his head,

informing the defendants that “it was not possible, that [he] could



3 Cepeda and Meléndez also pled guilty.   (Docket Nos. 246 and 302.)   They did
not, however, testify at trial.

Criminal No. 18-451 (FAB)                                                     4

be the person they were looking for.”          Id. at p. 13.       Pizarro and

Cepeda fled Naguabo in the Tacoma, followed by Huertas and Luyando

in an SUV.   Id.   Cáez remained on the ground in “tall grass” for

two minutes until the [defendants] left” with his Tacoma, wallet,

and cellular phone.    (Docket No. 406 at p. 14.)

     B.   The May 27, 2018 Carjacking: Counts Twelve and Thirteen

          On May 27, 2018, Luyando, Huertas, Pizarro and Meléndez,

using the Tacoma they had carjacked from Cáez, stole an Infiniti

FX45 from Gilberto Medina-Cardona (“Medina”) and his family, who

were on a day trip in Río Grande, Puerto Rico.            (Docket No. 406 at

p. 20.)   Medina had parked the Infiniti near a waterfall to take

photos.   Id. at p. 23.       Two of Medina’s family members had gone

down from the roadway to take pictures of the waterfall.                    Two

defendants   emerged   from    the    stolen    Tacoma,    pointing     loaded

firearms at Medina and his family, “screaming and yelling for

[them] to get on [their] knees” and look away.            Id. at pp. 23-24;

Docket No. 413 at p. 74.        The defendants demanded Medina’s car

keys and the family’s “personal belongings, money, jewelry” and

professional grade cameras.      (Docket No. 406 at p. 24.)

          Medina   informed     the   defendants    that     the    keys   were

located “in the cupholder of the [Infiniti].”                Id. at p. 24.

Before driving away, the defendants instructed Medina: “don’t look

back, don’t look back. Count to one hundred and stay there.”               Id.

Criminal No. 18-451 (FAB)                                                    5

at p. 25. Luyando testified that the defendants stole this vehicle

“by intimidation and force.”          (Docket No. 413 at p. 75.)        Medina

felt “terror,” “panic,” and “unable to manage the situation.”

(Docket No. 406 at p. 26.)         The defendants ultimately burned and

abandoned the Infiniti near an “old factory” in La Central, Puerto

Rico.     (Docket No. 413 at p. 83.)

     C.      The May 31, 2018 Kidnapping and Murder of Luis Sáenz-
             Martínez: Counts Fourteen, Fifteen, and Sixteen

             Luyando, Huertas, and Pizarro visited an acquaintance at

the Villas Del Río public housing project on May 31, 2018.           (Docket

No. 413 at p. 77.)         They “came up with the idea” of “holding up”

Sáenz, the drug dealer” associated with this location and “enemy”

of the defendants.         Id. at pp. 77-78.

             The defendants initially requested to purchase “weed”

from Sáenz.     Id. at p. 81.      They then aimed a loaded AK-47 and a

pistol at him, forcing Sáenz into the backseat of a Toyota RAV4.

Id. at p. 81.      Luyando, Huertas, and Pizarro asked Sáenz if “he

knew of another person who was of higher rank [in a rival drug

trafficking organization, asking] him if he wanted to give up

somebody else.”       Id. at p. 82.    Sáenz remained silent.     Id.     After

consulting     with   an    individual   named   “Gongo,”   the   defendants

understood that “they were to kill Sáenz.”           Id. at p. 83.

Criminal No. 18-451 (FAB)                                                     6

            Luyando drove the RAV4 to La Central, “close to the

Infiniti.”      Id.    Pizarro forced Sáenz out of the RAV4, shooting

him in the back with the AK-47.            Id. at p. 85.     A firearm expert

testified that casings recovered from this location emanated from

an AK-47, buttressing the credibility of Luyando’s testimony.

(Docket No. 419 at p. 13.)          Subsequently, Huertas shot Sáenz with

the same firearm.       (Docket No. 413 at p. 87.)          Luyando then “took

[the   AK47]    away   from    [Huertas]   and   also   started   shooting   at

[Sáenz].”       Id.    A forensic pathologist from the Puerto Rico

Institute of Forensic Science testified that Sáenz sustained 26

gunshot wounds to the skull, torso, and lower extremities.              Id. at

p. 31. The defendants unceremoniously “got in [the RAV4] and left”

the scene.      Id. at p. 87.

       D.   The June 3, 2018 Carjacking: Counts Eight and Nine

            On June 3, 2018, Luyando and Huertas “decided to have

another vehicle” in Piñones, Puerto Rico.                (Docket No. 413 at

p. 90.)     Edwin Barreras-Romero (“Barreras”) had driven a Nissan

Altima to this location “early in the morning” to surf, accompanied

by two female friends.             (Docket No. 406 at p. 100.)         Huertas

approached Barreras on the beach with a loaded AR-15, stating:

“Hey, this is a carjacking.”           Id. at p. 101.       Barreras attempted

to   distract    Huertas      by   “joking”   with   him,    hopeful   for   the

opportunity to “take this guy.”            Id.   He observed Luyando emerge

Criminal No. 18-451 (FAB)                                                  7

“from the bushes,” however, and strike his female friend in the

head with a loaded AK-47.       Id. at p. 102.    Luyando testified that

he “kicked [this female] so that she’d fall to the ground.”

(Docket No. 413 at p. 91.)          Barreras then “had to get down,”

“afraid for [his life].”      Id. at p. 110.     The defendants shouted:

“Stay down or we’re [sic] kill you . . . Stay down.          Don’t look at

us.”    Id. at p. 112.

            Luyando   attempted    to   remove    a   diamond   ring     from

Barrera’s female friend, threatening to “rape” her if she resisted

this demand.    (Docket No. 406 at p. 112.)      He abandoned the diamond

ring, however, in favor of an expeditious escape.            Huertas drove

the Nissan to Loíza, Puerto Rico, with $700 in United States

currency, a surfboard, a watch, and several cell phones which were

inside the vehicle.      (Docket No. 406 at p. 111; Docket No. 413 at

p. 90.)

       E.   The First June 4, 2018 Carjacking: Counts Four and Five

            María Martínez-Figueroa (“Martínez”) and her husband

drove to Punta Santiago, Puerto Rico in their burgundy Toyota Camry

to catch crabs at a nearby beach on June 4, 2018.          (Docket No. 406

at p. 132.)     At approximately 10:30 p.m., Luyando, Pizarro and

Huertas observed this “elderly couple” seated inside the Camry on

a dark road.    (Docket No. 406 at p. 133; Docket No. 413 at pp. 92-

93.)

            Earlier that day, “it had occurred to [the defendants]

that [they] should steal a car.”          (Docket No. 413 at p. 92.)

Luyando parked the defendants’ vehicle in front of the Camry.           Id.

at p. 93.    Huertas and Pizarro aimed loaded firearms at the couple.

Id.   Martínez exited the car, but her husband refused to placate

the defendants.     Id.   Huertas “told him that he was gonna shoot

him if he didn’t get out.”     Id. at p. 84.    Luyando reiterated this

threat, shouting that he, too, would “shoot [Martínez’s husband]”

if he remained in the Camry.     Id.   He complied only after Martínez

stated that “it was better to lose the car than [their] lives.”

(Docket No. 406 at p. 137.)         Martínez “[asked] for her purse”

before the defendants fled.        (Docket No. 413 at p. 94.)           They

denied this request, absconding with the Camry and the couple’s

personal belongings.      Id. at p. 95.

            Huertas confessed to this crime and signed a written

statement.    The United States presented the following admission at

trial:

      June 19, 2018, 12:40 PM. Interview with Jairo Huertas-
      Mercado. He was in Loíza hanging out with some friends
      in Las Cuevas neighborhood.    There they planned what
      they were going to do. They said, we’re going to look
      for a car. They left Las Cuevas neighborhood and took
      Road No. 3 until we got to Naguabo beach. There we saw
      this Burgundy car parked. I don’t know the make. We
      saw the car and turned around and we stopped them. Took
      the car and drove it to the projects, there we sold it
      to some guys there. I don’t know their names. [Signed]
      Jairo Huertas-Mercado, 12:15 PM, June 19, 2018.

(Docket No. 406 at p. 153-54, see Trial Ex. 36-A.)                    Huertas

repeated this statement to law enforcement officers, conceding

that he participated in the “carjacking of a burgundy Toyota

Camry.”    (Docket No. 403 at p. 36.)

     F.     The Second June 4, 2018 Carjacking: Counts Six and Seven

            Immediately   after   robbing    Martínez    and   her   husband,

Huertas and Pizarro carjacked a fifth vehicle.          (Docket No. 413 at

p. 96.)    Alicia Roldán-Sánchez (“Roldán”) had “left church to have

[dinner] with some friends” on June 4, 2018.            (Docket No. 406 at

p. 168.)    Huertas and Pizarro passed Roldán’s Kia Sportage in the

Camry they had previously stolen from the elderly couple.                 Id.

They abruptly stopped on the road.          Id.   A defendant exited this

vehicle, pointed a firearm at Roldán’s face, and yelled:                “Walk

towards the vegetation or I’ll fire shots at you.” (Docket No. 406

at p. 171.)      Roldán felt “fearful in a very isolated location.

[She] feared for her life.”       Id.   Pizarro and Huertas stole the

Sportage with Roldán’s cellphone and purse inside the vehicle.

Id. at p. 172.    Huertas confessed to law enforcement officers that

he carjacked a Kia Sportage “from a lady.”              (Docket No. 413 at

p. 36.)

     G.     The June 5, 2018 Kidnapping of Bryant Meyers: Counts
            One, Two and Three

            Huertas, Luyando, Pizarro, and Villegas kidnapped Bryan

Robert Rohena-Pérez, also known as Bryant Meyers (“Meyers”), on

June 5, 2018 from a public basketball court.         (Docket No. 412 at

p. 6.)    On this day, Huertas requested that Villegas accompany him

“to the Las Lomas Ward neighborhood where [Meyers’] mother lived”

to settle “some accounts.”        Id. at p. 54.        Huerta’s cousin,

“Corroro,” had previously acquired “some pounds of marijuana” from

Meyers.    Id.   This illicit transaction allegedly resulted in a

dispute that prompted Meyers to pay for Corroro’s murder.           Id. at

p. 54. Meyers, an “urban music singer,” then referred to Corroro’s

demise in a song. Id. at p. 56; Docket No. 413 at p. 38. According

to Luyando, Huertas “had this grudge against [Meyers] . . . because

of his cousin’s death.”     (Docket No. 413 at p. 100.)

            Gongo spoke with Huertas on the phone, instructing the

defendants that if they intended to confront Meyers, they should

“do it well.”    Id. at p. 99.   Subsequently, Huertas drove Luyando,

Pizarro, and Villegas to Las Lomas Ward in the stolen Kia Sportage.

Id. at p. 55.      Villegas carried a “Glock automatic 9 by 19.

[Pizarro] was carrying an AK-47.      [Huertas carried] an AK-47 known

as The Punisher.     [Lastly, Luyando carried] an AR-15.”          Id. at

p. 61.    All firearms were loaded.    Id.

Criminal No. 18-451 (FAB)                                                  11

          Meyers “[was] playing basketball – there were quite a

few people at the court . . . younger guys, there were several men

. . . from the neighborhood.”       (Docket No. 413 at p. 39.)          María

Elena Pérez-Díaz (“Ms. Pérez”), Meyers’ mother, observed Huertas

passing the front of her parents’ house at approximately 5:45 p.m.

“carrying on his right side a long weapon.”          (Docket No. 412 at

p. 8.)   She attempted to call Meyers.          Id. at p. 9.      Huertas

immediately     located   Meyers,   however,   preventing     Pérez      from

alerting her son.    Id. at p. 10.

          A chaotic “mess ensued” once the defendants entered the

basketball court.    (Docket No. 413 at p. 19.)       During this melee,

the defendants shouted:     “nobody move and look down to the floor.”

Id. at p. 20.    Bystanders gathered around the defendants to thwart

the kidnapping.     Id. at p. 102.       The defendants dispersed the

crowd, however, by firing a shot into the air.         Id. at p. 102.

          Ms. Pérez ran to the basketball court, observing Huertas

pulling her son Meyers by the hair.      Id. at p. 20.    The defendants

aimed their firearms at Meyers, dragging him away from the location

against his will.    Id. at p. 11.    They hit “[him] in the head with

[a] pistol a couple of times.”      (Docket No. 413 at p. 41.)    Indeed,

Luyando testified that Meyers “[fought] back, he didn’t want to

walk, so I hit him on the head with the weapon that I had and we

were able to immobilize him somewhat to get him close to the

vehicles.”    (Docket No. 413 at p. 102.)

            Ms. Pérez approached the defendants, “asking why they

were doing that, to leave [Meyers] alone, what was it that they

wanted?”    Id. at pp. 11-12.     Huertas grabbed Ms. Pérez’s phone and

“broke it” before she could call 911.          Id. at p. 12.     She begged

the defendants “to please leave [Meyers] alone and not to harm

him,” offering them money.        Id.    Ms. Pérez grasped onto Meyers’

sneakers while the defendants forced him into the Kia Sportage,

stating “wherever he’s going I’m going too.”          Id.   The defendants

again “hit [Meyers] a couple of times in the head, so [he] couldn’t

see very well.”     (Docket No. 413 at p. 40.)

            Huertas asked Ms. Pérez for the keys to Meyer’s BMW X6

SUV.   (Docket No. 413 at pp. 19 and 40; Docket No. 412 at p. 39.)

Luyando, Pizarro, and Villegas remained in the Kia Sportage with

Meyers while Huertas and Ms. Pérez entered the BMW.                 (Docket

No. 412 at p. 20.)       Huertas placed the AK-47 between his legs,

driving the BMW closely behind the Kia Sportage.             Id. at p. 21.

Ms. Pérez again asked Huertas “what . . . he wanted.”           Id. Huertas

answered:    “I’ve just been ordered . . . It’s an order . . . Just

take it easy, stay calm.”         Id.   Luyando, Pizarro, and Villegas

repeatedly “[asked Meyers] for money . . . [If Meyers] could go

get money and how much money [he] could get.”           (Docket No. 413 at

p. 45.)     Meyers offered to write the defendants a check.         Id. at

p. 104.   Luyando then asked Meyers:    “[Are you] stupid or something

‘cause if [Meyers] was gonna write a check out . . . when [the

defendants] go cash it [they] would get arrested.”         Id. at p. 104.

            The defendants parked both vehicles at the entrance to

a landfill in Carolina, Puerto Rico. Id. at p. 23. Police officers

who were on patrol subsequently arrived unexpectedly. Id. Huertas

then “opened the [car] door, grabbed his weapon and left running”

to a “woody area.”    Id. at pp. 23 and 25.     Law enforcement pursued

Huertas on foot, but to no avail.      Id.

            Meyers then “jumped out of” the Kia Sportage, injuring

his knee.     (Docket No. 413 at p. 43.)      The remaining defendants

and police officers exchanged fire. Id. A police vehicle collided

with the KIA Sportage, but Luyando “was able to get the patrol car

unhooked from the SUV.”      Id. at p. 105.      Luyando, Pizarro, and

Villegas escaped, “helped [Huertas] get out of the bushes” after

the police officers left, and burned the Kia Sportage.             Id. at

p. 106.

            Huertas confessed to kidnapping Meyers, stating that he

committed this crime because “the artist had made some comments in

a song against a group.”     (Docket No. 403 at p. 30.)       He intended

“to take away [Meyers] to confront him about the comments that he

had made and to ask [him] if he was ready . . . to go to war.”

Id.   Huertas’ confession corroborated that:           Luyando and Villegas

participated in the kidnapping, the defendants “grabbed hold” of

Meyers     at    the   basketball   court,   he   carried   an   AR-15   rifle,

Ms. Pérez “tried to intervene on behalf of her son;” he drove

Ms. Pérez in Meyer’s BMW to the Carolina landfill behind the Kia

Sportage, and that the defendants “were able to escape.”                 Id. at

pp. 30-33.        Essentially, Huertas’ confession is consistent with

the testimony adduced by Meyers, Pérez, Luyando, and Villegas.

      H.        The Motions for Judgments of Acquittal

                On September 14, 2022, the jury found Huertas and Pizarro

guilty of counts one through sixteen of the third superseding-

indictment.        (Docket No. 420.)   Huertas and Pizarro challenge the

conviction for count one, carjacking the BMW during the kidnapping

of Bryant Meyers.        (Docket Nos. 427 and 435.)     Huertas argues that

this “vehicle was taken without any intent to cause death or bodily

harm.”     (Docket No. 427 at p. 5.)     The defendants purportedly stole

the BMW “out of convenience.”          Id.   Pizarro adopts this specious

argument, placing responsibility for the carjacking on Meyers’

mother.         (Docket No. 435 at p. 2.)           Ms. Pérez “voluntarily

produced” the BMW “so that she could go together with her son.”

(Docket No. 435 at p. 2.)

Criminal No. 18-451 (FAB)                                                           15

II.    Rule 29 Legal Standard

       A court may set aside a jury’s guilty verdict and enter a

judgment of acquittal of any offense for which the evidence is

insufficient to sustain a conviction.                See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29.

In reviewing a motion for judgment of acquittal, a court must

consider      the    evidence    “in   the   light    most   favorable    to    the

prosecution” and determine whether the “body of proof, as a whole,

has sufficient bite to ground a reasoned conclusion that the

government proved each of the elements of the charged crime beyond

a reasonable doubt.”            United States v. Lara, 181 F.3d 183, 200

(1st Cir. 1999) (citations omitted).

       Rule 29 motions require a court to “take into account all

evidence,      both    direct    and   circumstantial,       and   [to]   resolve

evidentiary conflicts and credibility disputes in favor of the

jury’s verdict.”        United States v. Valerio, 676 F.3d 237, 244 (1st

Cir. 2012).         The First Circuit Court of Appeals has called this

sufficiency of evidence challenge “a tough sell,” United States v.

Polanco, 634 F.3d 39, 45 (1st Cir. 2011), and a “daunting hurdle,”

United States v. Hatch, 434 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2006).

       While the sufficiency of the evidence is at the heart of the

Rule 29 inquiry, deference to the jury’s verdict controls the

Court’s analysis.        To uphold the jury’s guilty verdict, the Court

need   only    determine    that    the   conviction    “finds     support     in   a
     Case 3:18-cr-00451-FAB Document 460 Filed 12/14/22 Page 16 of 20



Criminal No. 18-451 (FAB)                                               16

plausible rendition of the record.”        United States v. Shaw, 670

F.3d 360, 362 (1st Cir. 2012).          Ultimately, a defendant must

establish that “the evidence is so scant that a rational factfinder

could not conclude that the government proved all the essential

elements of the charged crime beyond a reasonable doubt.”           United

States v. Vázquez-Soto, 939 F.3d 365, 371 (1st Cir. 2019).

     A.    Carjacking

           The jury had to find that the United States proved each

element of the charged offenses beyond a reasonable doubt to

convict Huertas and Pizarro.       See Powell v. Tompkins, 783 F.3d

332, 354 (1st Cir. 2015) (“The Due Process Clause requires the

prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all of the elements

included in the definition of the offense of which the defendant

is charged.”) (quoting McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79, 85

(1986)).   To secure a conviction, the United States had to satisfy

four elements:

     (1) the taking or attempted taking from the person or
     presence of another; (2) of a motor vehicle that has
     been transported, shipped, or received in interstate or
     foreign commerce; (3) through the use of force,
     violence, or intimation; (4) with the intent to cause
     death or serious bodily harm.

United States v. Velázquez-Aponte, 940 F.3d 785 F.3d 785, 797 (1st

Cir. 2019) (citing 18 U.S.C. § 2119).

Criminal No. 18-451 (FAB)                                                    17

           The    intent   to   cause   death   or    bodily   harm    may   be

“conditional,” encompassing a “willingness to [kill or harm] if

necessary to hijack the car.”        United States v. Evans-García, 322

F.3d 110, 114 (1st Cir. 2003) (citing Holloway v. United States,

526 U.S. 1, 11-12 (1999)) (emphasis added); see United States v.

Meléndez-Rivas, 566 F.3d 41, 43 (“[The] intent requirement is

satisfied if at the time [the defendant] took control of the

motorcycle, he had an intent to kill or cause serious bodily injury

to the driver, whether or not the intent was necessary to take the

vehicle.”).      The relevant intent is the mens rea “at the moment

the   defendant    demanded     or   took   control    over    the    driver’s

automobile.”     United States v. Díaz-Rosado, 857 F.3d 116, 121 (1st

Cir. 2017) (noting that “the government does not have to prove

that the defendant always intended, regardless of the victim’s

actions, to cause serious bodily harm”).

III. Discussion

      Huertas and Pizarro assert that the United States failed to

establish that the defendants obtained the BMW with the intent to

cause death or serious bodily harm.          (Docket Nos. 427 and 435.)

This argument lacks merit.

      The First Circuit Court of Appeals has repeatedly held that

“touching or threatening a victim while brandishing a firearm is

sufficient evidence of intent ‘to cause death or serious bodily
        Case 3:18-cr-00451-FAB Document 460 Filed 12/14/22 Page 18 of 20



Criminal No. 18-451 (FAB)                                                      18

harm’ within the meaning of § 2119.”              United States v. Guerrero-

Narváez, 29 F.4th 1, 10-11 (1st Cir. 2022) (citing United States

v. Catalán-Román, 585 F.3d 453, 474 (1st Cir. 2009) (evidence that

the defendant “pointed a nickel-plated pistol at Julia’s face while

demanding [that the driver] exit the car” satisfied the intent

element in a section 2119 prosecution); Díaz-Rosado, 857 F.3d at

121, 126) (“Just as one can use brute force or a variety of items

to kill or cause serious harm, one can also use such force or items

to   manifest     an    intent   to    cause     death   or   serious   harm   if

necessary.”)).

      Huertas and Pizarro ambushed Meyers with loaded firearms in

a public area.         Ms. Pérez testified that Huertas aimed a firearm

at her and broke her phone.            (Docket No. 413 at pp. 19-20.)           A

defendant fired a shot at the basketball court, an intimidating

act heard by Ms. Pérez and Meyers.             Huertas held an AK-47 between

his legs inside the BMW, placing the firearm within reach should

Ms. Pérez resist.         Id. at p. 21.        Ms. Pérez felt “nervous and

scared.”       Id. at p. 22.          Indeed, the record is replete with

testimony establishing that the defendants used violence to kidnap

Meyers and carjack the BMW.

      Ms. Pérez’s efforts to rescue her son do not detract from the

force    and   intimidation      employed   by    the    defendants.    Coerced

facilitation of a carjacking does not negate the defendants’ use
     Case 3:18-cr-00451-FAB Document 460 Filed 12/14/22 Page 19 of 20



Criminal No. 18-451 (FAB)                                               19

of force or intimidation.        Accordingly, the defendants cannot

escape liability for carjacking the BMW because Ms. Pérez assisted

Huertas in locating the keys and pursued her son’s assailants.

     Huertas posits that the BMW was “taken incidentally to the

kidnapping” and “out of convenience.”        (Docket No. 427 at p. 5.)

The fruits of illicit endeavors (i.e. cars, drugs, cash) are often

“convenient” for criminals to possess.        Why else would they risk

incarceration to steal these objects?        Huertas carjacked the BMW

precisely because it was convenient for him to escape from the

basketball court in a vehicle of substantial value.         Moreover, the

acquisition of a vehicle need not be the primary objective of a

defendant for section 2119 to attach. See United States v. Rivera-

Figueroa, 149 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1989) (“But nothing in the

statute requires that the taking be the ultimate motive of the

crime.   It is enough that the defendant be aware that the action

in which he is engaged, whether by himself or through direction or

assistance to another, involves the taking of a motor vehicle.”);

United States v. García-Álvarez, 541 F.3d 8, 16 (1st Cir. 2008)

(rejecting the defendants’ argument that “the Government [failed

to meet] its burden of establishing the intent element beyond a

reasonable doubt because [the defendants] did not intend to take

[the victim’s] car but only to rob his home;” that the “car was

only an improvised getaway vehicle” was irrelevant).
