                  DEFENDANT’S SENTENCING MEMORANDUM

     Defendant, Michael Fowler, submits this memorandum to assist

the Court in sentencing.     As set forth in detail in the

Presentence Report, the conduct in this matter is inextricably

entwined with the conduct that was the subject Folwer’s plea and

sentencing in United States v. Michael Fowler, Criminal No. 04-

10308-JLT, in which Judge Tauro sentenced Fowler to 120 months

imprisonment.    In so doing, Judge Tauro (1) adopted the joint

objection of the parties to the Probation Department’s suggestion

that the offense involved 25 or more weapons, (2) determined that

the correct Total Offense Level was 27, (3) determined the

resulting guideline sentencing range was 120-150 months, (3)

rejected the government’s invitation to sentence at the high end

of the guideline range, and (4) rejected defendant’s suggestion

that a variance to 100 months was warranted.

     Although no plea agreement was filed in the instant matter,1

the government has repeatedly and forthrightly represented to

this and Judge Tauro’s session that it would recommend an

identical concurrent sentence in this session once Fowler was

sentenced by Judge Tauro; indeed, the plea and sentencing hearing

in this matter has been the subject of repeated joint requests in

order to dispose of the Judge Tauro matter.

     As the Presentence Report correctly points out, see PSR

§182, the sentence imposed by this Court is subject to U.S.S.G.

§5G1.3(b) because Fowler, having been sentenced by Judge Tauro,

is now serving an undischarged term of imprisonment.           Moreover,

the Federal Bureau of Prisons will not award any jail credit to

on the sentence imposed by this Court because any time spent in

pretrial detention will be credited only to the sentence imposed

by Judge Tauro.    See 18 U.S.C. § 3585(b)(2) (mandating that jail

credit for time spent in detention may only be credited against

one sentence).    Thus, Fowler appears before this Court with no

jail credit on the instant matter but having completed nearly




     1
      Fowler until recently elected to proceed pro se in Judge
Tauro’s session as well as before this Court. He thus
represented himself during the negotiations that ultimately
disposed of the Judge Tauro’s this case. Fowler and the
government negotiated and filed a plea agreement in the Judge
Tauro case with, as described below, an oral agreement concerning
sentencing in this matter.

half of the sentence imposed by Judge Tauro.2          Consequently, in

order to execute the intent of the parties and satisfy §5G1.2 in

light of Judge Tauro’s 120 month sentence, this Court should

adjust its sentence to account for the time already served and

impose a sentence of sixty (60) months imprisonment concurrent

with the sentence imposed by Judge Tauro.         Such a sentence,

assuming credit for good time, will result in Fowler serving 51

months from the date of sentencing and his release in July 2012

and thus his release from this sentence at roughly the same time

as his release on the sentence imposed by Judge Tauro.

                              CONCLUSION

     For the foregoing reasons, the Court should adopt the joint

position of the parties that the Total Offense Level is 27 and

the resulting guideline sentencing rage is 120-150 months.              This

Court should impose a low-end guideline sentence, adjusted to

sixty (60) months imprisonment to comply with U.S.S.G. §5G1.3(b),

to run concurrent with the sentence imposed in Criminal No. 04-

10308-JLT.   A three-year period of supervised release should

follow.   The Court should impose no fine.

      Fowler was arrested on January 22, 2004 and has been
detained ever since. Assuming good time, he will be released on
the sentence imposed by Judge Tauro in July 2012.
