                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                        DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

     v.                                   Criminal No. 07-cr-173-1-PB

Corey J. Clark


                    ORDER OF DETENTION PENDING TRIAL


     In accordance with Section 3142(f) of the Bail Reform Act,

18 U.S.C. §§ 3141 et seq., a hearing was conducted on August 28,

2007, for the purpose of determining whether to detain defendant,

Corey J. Clark, who has been indicted on one count of being a

drug user in possession of ammunition and one count of being a

person convicted of the misdemeanor crime of domestic violence in

possession of ammunition.

     Under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(b), a court, in making a

determination regarding detention, must evaluate the risk of the

defendant’s flight, the risk to the safety of any other person,

and the risk to the safety of the community.           In circumstances

when detention is not mandated by the court, the court is

nonetheless empowered to impose conditions on release.             18 U.S.C.

§ 3142(c).

     Pursuant to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) a court,

in assessing the risks noted in 18 U.S.C. § 3142(b), shall

consider the following: (1) the nature and circumstances of the

offense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence as to guilt;

(3) the history and characteristics of the accused, including

family ties, past history, financial resources and employment;

and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or

the community that would be posed by a release.

     Here, I find that the government has met its burden.

Specifically, the weight of the evidence is substantial, caught

in possession and an admission of drug usage.        He has a violent

history with numerous assaults.      He is a danger to the community.

     Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the defendant be detained

pending trial.

     The defendant is committed to the custody of the Attorney

General or his designated representative for confinement in a

corrections facility separate, to the extent practicable, from

persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody

pending appeal.   The defendant shall be afforded a reasonable

opportunity for private consultation with defense counsel.           On

order of a court of the United States or on request of an

attorney for the Government, the person in charge of the

corrections facility shall deliver the defendant to the United

States Marshal for the purpose of an appearance in connection

with a court proceeding.

      SO ORDERED.
