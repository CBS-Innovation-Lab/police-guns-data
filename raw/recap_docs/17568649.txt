                            CRIMINAL NO. 11-10038-RWZ

                            UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

                                            v.

                                  RASHAD GREAVES

                                         ORDER

                                   November 8, 2011
ZOBEL, D.J.

      Defendant is charged with possession of a firearm and ammunition in violation of

18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). He has moved for a pretrial ruling on whether he would be

subject to the enhanced sentencing provisions of the Armed Career Criminal Act

(“ACCA”) if he is convicted or pleads guilty (Docket # 33). Specifically, I must decide

whether his two prior convictions for rape and rape of a child were committed on

“occasions different from one another” under the ACCA. 18 U.S.C. § 924(e).

      The motion is ALLOWED to the extent that I will consider the issue now and will

consult only source material permitted by Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 16

(2005). See United States v. Gautier, 590 F.Supp.2d 214, 230-32 (D.Mass. 2008).

Although the parties have already briefed the issue on the merits, since the issue is in

the nature of a sentencing I will decide the merits after a hearing, with defendant

present, on December 8, 2011, at 3:00 pm.
