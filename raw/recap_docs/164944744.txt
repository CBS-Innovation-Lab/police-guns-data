              OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S EMERGENCY MOTION
             FOR COMPASSIONATE RELEASE FROM INCARCERATION

       The United States of America, by and through undersigned counsel, submits this opposition

to Defendant’s Motion for Compassionate Release and Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion

(“Def.’s Mot.”), filed pro se by Jonathan Andrade (“ANDRADE”), and his counsel’s Emergency

Supplemental Motion for Compassionate Release under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A) (“Emergency

Motion”) his counsel.     Although sympathetic to the concerns raised by ANDRADE, the

government submits that Defendant’s motion should be denied.

       First, ANDRADE has already tested positive for COVID-19 and has since recovered.

Despite his aggravating factor of obesity, ANDRADE’s medical records indicated that he has

suffered no significant adverse consequences from his earlier COVID-19 infection and that his

preexisting medical conditions are being well managed by the medical staff at FCI Fort Dix.

Additionally, ANDRADE was offered the vaccine and refused. For these two reasons, ANDRADE

cannot establish an “extraordinary and compelling reason” to warrant modification of his sentence

pursuant to § 3582(c)(1)(A)(i).

       Second, the Bureau of Prisons (“the BOP”) has taken aggressive measures in light of the

COVID-19 pandemic to mitigate the spread of infection. Most recently, the BOP has begun

administering vaccinations to staff and inmates, in accordance with the current CDC guidelines,

as they become available. Although unfortunately there have been COVID-19 outbreaks at various
         Case 1:17-cr-10304-PBS Document 79 Filed 03/24/21 Page 2 of 21




BOP institutions, including FCI Fort Dix, a COVID-19 outbreak in and of itself is not enough to

establish grounds for compassionate release. Moreover, based on recent reports from the BOP,

FCI Fort Dix appears to emerging from an earlier outbreak at the facility.

       Third, even if ANDRADE were able to satisfy the “extraordinary and compelling reason”

threshold necessary to consider compassionate release, the balance of the remaining factors set

forth in § 3553(a) weigh strongly against his release. Under the circumstances, release of

ANDRADE would present an untenable risk of danger to the community and would not be

“consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.” 18 U.S.C.

§ 3582(c)(1)(A). It would also send precisely the wrong message to the community concerning

the seriousness of ANDRADE’s prior illegal conduct.

                                       I.      BACKGROUND

       A. ANDRADE’s Criminal Conduct Underlying His Current Incarceration

       The morning of September 15, 2017, at approximately 6:00 a.m., law enforcement arrived

at ANDRADE’s apartment in Quincy, Massachusetts, to execute multiple search warrants. PSR

at ¶ 9. Some agents went up to the eighth floor and knocked on his apartment door, while others

secured the perimeter. PSR at ¶ 9. Upon knocking, those officials on the perimeter “observed an

individual throw a black, canvas, messenger-style bag to the sidewalk below.” PSR at ¶ 9. Video

footage later confirmed that bag came from ANDRADE’s apartment window. PSR at ¶ 9, n.1.

Law enforcement then entered the apartment building, where they saw ANDRADE, the only

individual in the apartment, standing next to an open window. PSR at ¶ 10. He was arrested

shortly thereafter. PSR at ¶ 10.

       ANDRADE’s belongings were then searched pursuant to the search warrant. The canvas

bag that ANDRADE threw from the window “was found to contain approximately 1,500 grams of



                                                2
         Case 1:17-cr-10304-PBS Document 79 Filed 03/24/21 Page 3 of 21




a white powder substance that field tested positive for the presence of cocaine, approximately 2

kilograms of a white powder that was believed to be fentanyl, and approximately 280 grams of a

substance that was believed to be cocaine base.” PSR at ¶ 9. Law enforcement, in searching the

apartment, retrieved a stolen “9mm semi-automatic firearm” from the top drawer of a nightstand

next to which ANDRADE consistently slept. See PSR at ¶ 10. Also on the nightstand was one

of two cell phones intercepted by authorities. PSR at ¶ 10. In the office, authorities recovered

“[a]pproximately $20,000, luxury jewelry, and several gold bars . . . .” PSR at ¶ 10. In the kitchen,

officers recovered “[b]aggies and a heat sealer . . . .” PSR at ¶ 10.

       Law enforcement then turned their attention to Andrade’s vehicles which included a BMW,

a Nissan Altima, a Chevy Malibu, and a Dodge Van. PSR at ¶ 11. While searching these vehicles,

“investigators discovered two electronic hides within the Altima. The hides contained the second

cellular telephone that was intercepted during the course of the [investigation], a ‘smart watch,’ as

well as quantities of cocaine and fentanyl.” PSR at ¶ 11.

       Altogether, law enforcement seized a huge amount of drugs attributable to ANDRADE:

128.83 grams of cocaine base, 3.29 kilograms of cocaine, and 1.2 kilograms of fentanyl. PSR at

¶ 11. Knowing that he was making large sums of money through illegal means, ANDRADE

attempted to launder his funds, including over $10,000 in drug proceeds through a Los Angeles

based tattoo artist, who used the proceeds to build a tattoo parlor. PSR at ¶ 12. This “business”

relationship indicates a particular degree of criminal mindset derived from ANDRADE’s dealings.

       On January 29, 2018, pursuant to a C plea agreement, ANDRADE pled guilty to Possession

With Intent to Distribute 400 grams or More of Fentanyl, 500 grams or More of Cocaine and 28

Grams or More of Cocaine Base, and Heroin; Felon in Possession of a Firearm; Possession of a

Firearm in Furtherance of a Drug Trafficking Offense; and Unlawful Monetary Transaction

           Case 1:17-cr-10304-PBS Document 79 Filed 03/24/21 Page 4 of 21




PSR at ¶ 2. Consistent with the C plea agreement, the Court sentenced ANDRADE to principally

240 months in prison.

       B. Background to This Proceeding

       On January 11, 2021, ANDRADE wrote to FCI Fort Dix Warden David E. Ortiz

requesting compassionate release. Exhibit A. In his request, ANDRADE argues that his

preexisting medical conditions (“chronic asthma, obesity, heart murmurs, anxiety, depression

and shortness of breath”) place him in a high-risk category, thereby creating an extraordinary and

compelling reason warranting his release. Exhibit A. ANDRADE also notes that he has not

received any discipline since being incarcerated, has used his time productively while

incarcerated, and has admirable plans upon his release. Exhibit A.

       Four days later, on January 15, R. Robinson, the R.I.S. Coordinator responded. After

detailing the current law and BOP policy regarding compassionate release, Robinson requested

that ANDRADE resubmit his compassionate release request because it did not fall meet any

specific category. More particularly, Robinson stated that extraordinary and compelling reasons

included “the inmate’s terminal medical condition; debilitated medical condition; status as a

‘new law’[;] elderly inmate, an elderly inmate with medical conditions, or an ‘other elderly

inmate’; the death or incapacitation of the family member caregiver of the inmate’s child; or the

incapacitation of the inmate’s spouse or registered partner.” Exhibit A. There is no indication

that ANDRADE ever resubmitted a request for compassionate release. 1



       1
          There remains an open question as to whether ANDRADE actually exhausted his
administrative remedies prior to filing his motion. Because his request was immediately
rejected, the response by the R.I.S. coordinator may not constitute a receipt by the warden under
the statute. Because the answer to this procedural issue is unclear, the Government focuses on
the substantive aspects of ANDRADE’s claim. While there may be a procedural reason for
denying his claim, the substantive reasons present a substantially stronger rationale for denying
his claim and are not a close a question. For these reasons, the Government focuses on the
                                                4

                            II.     APPLICABLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK

       Section 3582(c) begins with the principle that “a court may not modify a term of

imprisonment once it has been imposed.” 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c); see Dillon v. United States, 560

U.S. 817, 824–25 (2010). “[T]here is no ‘inherent authority’ for a district court to modify a

sentence as it pleases; indeed a district court’s discretion to modify a sentence is an exception to

[§ 3582’s] general rule” barring modification. United States v. Cunningham, 554 F.3d 703,708

(7th Cir. 2009); cf. United states v. Goodwyn, 596 F.3d 233, 235 (4th Cir. 2010) (noting that 18

U.S.C. § 3582(b) “states that a district court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has

been imposed unless the Bureau of Prisons moves for a reduction, the Sentencing Commission

amends the applicable Guidelines range, or another statute or Rule 35 expressly permits the court

to do so”).

       Section 3582(c)(1)(A) represents an exception to this general rule. A court may now

consider a defendant’s motion for compassionate release following the exhaustion of his or her

administrative remedies with the BOP or 30 days after submitting a request to the appropriate

Warden, whichever is sooner.

       The court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed
       except that, . . . the court, upon motion of the defendant after the defendant has
       fully exhausted all administrative rights to appeal a failure of the Bureau of
       Prisons to bring a motion on the defendant’s behalf or the lapse of 30 days from
       the receipt of such a request by the warden of the defendant’s facility, whichever
       is earlier, may reduce the term of imprisonment . . . .

18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A) (emphasis added). As applicable here, the court can only modify a

sentence if, “after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent they are



substance of ANDRADE’s claim as opposed to the potential procedural shortcomings.
Nonetheless, this should not be construed as a concession that ANDRADE has satisfied all of the
necessary procedural requirements.

                                                  5

applicable,” it finds that “extraordinary and compelling reasons warrant such a reduction,” 18

U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A)(i). The proposed reduction must be “consistent with applicable policy

statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.” 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A). These

statements are contained in U.S.S.G. § 1B1.13. These statements mandate that a release should

only occur if “the defendant is not a danger to the safety of any other person or to the

community, as provided in 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) ….” See USSG § 1B1.13(2).

       A. The Extraordinary and Compelling Reason Requirement

       The defendant bears the burden of proving that he is entitled to relief under 18 U.S.C.

§ 3582. See United States v. Butler, 970 F.2d 1017, 1026 (2d Cir. 1992) (“If the defendant seeks

decreased punishment, he or she has the burden of showing that the circumstances warrant that

decrease); cf. United States v. Hamilton, 715 F.3d 328, 337 (11th Cir. 2013) (“[A] defendant, as

the § 3582(c)(2) movant, bears the burden of establishing that a retroactive amendment has actually

lowered his guidelines range in his case.”).   Once satisfying the threshold precondition of

waiting 30 days following the receipt of the defendant’s request to the warden, the court may

modify a sentence only if, “after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent

they are applicable,” it finds that “extraordinary and compelling reasons warrant such a reduction,”

18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A)(i). 2 The proposed reduction must be “consistent with applicable policy

statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.” 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A).

       The Application Notes to Section 1B1.13 describe the circumstances under which

“extraordinary and compelling reasons exist.” U.S.S.G. § 1B1.13 Application Note 1. Application

Note 1(D) permits the court to reduce a sentence where, “[a]s determined by the Director of the



       2
        Section 3582(c)(1)(A)(ii) provides other bases by which a defendant may be eligible for
compassionate release; however, none of these factors are applicable in this case.

                                                 6

Bureau of Prisons, there exists in the defendant’s case an extraordinary and compelling reason

other than, or in combination with, the reasons described in subdivisions (A) through (C).” Id. at

App. Note 1(D). Accordingly, a court may grant compassionate release not only on grounds

specified by the Sentencing Commission, but also those set forth in the relevant BOP regulation

governing compassionate release. That regulation appears at BOP Program Statement 5050.50.

This program statement took effect on January 17, 2019, following passage of the First Step Act,

and contains standards that are both more extensive than and slightly different from those stated

in the § 1B1.13 Policy Statement. As is relevant here, the Program Statement defines a “debilitated

medical condition” as follows:

       Debilitated Medical Condition. RIS 3 consideration may also be given to inmates
       who have an incurable, progressive illness or who have suffered a debilitating
       injury from which they will not recover. The BOP should consider a RIS if the
       inmate is:

             •   Completely disabled, meaning the inmate cannot carry on any self-care and
                 is totally confined to a bed or chair; or

             •   Capable of only limited self-care and is confined to a bed or chair more than
                 50% of waking hours.

       The BOP’s review should also include any cognitive deficits of the inmate (e.g.,
       Alzheimer’s disease or traumatic brain injury that has affected the inmate’s mental
       capacity or function). A cognitive deficit is not required in cases of severe physical
       impairment, but may be a factor when considering the inmate’s ability or inability
       to reoffend.

Program Statement 5050.50 at 5. 4


       3
           RIS refers to a “reduction in sentence.” Program Statement 5050.50 at 4.

       4
         As noted, the Program Statement’s provisions regarding the class of inmates eligible for
compassionate release is slightly different from the related provision in Section 1B1.13. To the
extent that the Program Statement and the Policy Statement conflict, it is the Policy Statement in
Section 1B1.13–i.e., the source directly authorized by statute–that is binding. An interpretation in
the Program Statement that does not contradict the Policy Statement, however, is entitled to some
weight. See Reno v. Koray, 515 U.S. 50, 61 (1995) (BOP program statements, which do not require
                                                   7

       Even when an extraordinary and compelling reason exists, however, a court should

only grant a motion for release if it determines that the defendant is not a danger to the

public. USSG § 1B1.13(2). And, the court must consider, in general, whether the § 3553(a)

factors weigh in favor of release. See 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A); USSG § 1B1.13.

       B. BOP’s Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic

       The COVID-19 pandemic has presented an unprecedented risk to the worldwide

community, including to individuals and staff at jails and prisons. It is a highly contagious virus

about which little was known when it first emerged in the United States. Thereafter, public health

officials at the local, state, and national levels have continuously sought to provide guidance as to

the best measures to prevent and/or limit the spread of the virus.

       The BOP has begun administering vaccines to inmates under guidance from the CDC. As

of March 24, 2021, 97,108 doses of the vaccine have been distributed to BOP facilities, and 89,271

have been vaccinated.     FEDERAL BUREAU       OF   PRISONS, COVID-19 Vaccine Implementation,

https://www.bop.gov/coronavirus. BOP’s 92% administration rate is indicative of a dramatic

increase in efforts to get the virus under control. It is also demonstrative of the fact that BOP is

working diligently to make facilities safer for both inmates and employees.

       Outside the vaccine, the BOP, after consultation with public health officials, including at

the Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”), has implemented a series of policies and procedures

designed to prevent and/or mitigate the spread of COVID-19 within its facilities. As health experts

learn more, the BOP has continued to refine and implement additional comprehensive procedures

relating to screening, testing, treatment, prevention, education and infection control.



notice and comment, are entitled to “some deference” where they reflect a “permissible
construction of the statute”) (internal quotation marks omitted).

                                                 8
           Case 1:17-cr-10304-PBS Document 79 Filed 03/24/21 Page 9 of 21




       The policies and procedures implemented by the BOP have come in various stages, referred

to as “Phase I” through “Phase IX.” Since March 2020, the BOP began taking extensive measures

to modify their operations in an effort to increase social distancing among staff and inmates and

to reduce the risk and spread of COVID-19.             More specifically, these measures include

suspension/modification of social visits and tours, restriction of inmate movement inside and

outside of the facilities, health screens and testing of staff and inmates.

       In a further step to limit the spread of COVID-19 within the BOP’s facilities and decrease

its prison population while protecting the general public, the BOP has engaged in an additional

step of identifying and designating appropriate inmates for transfer from each of the BOP’s

facilities nationwide to extended home confinement. This initiative was based upon the Attorney

General’s expanded authority pursuant to § 12003(b)(2) of the CARES Act, which lengthened the

amount of time that the Attorney General may place an inmate in home confinement pursuant to

18 U.S.C. § 3624(c)(2). Pursuant to this initiative, staff at each institution are reviewing each

inmate’s medical history to determine whether he or she is at increased risk based upon age and

vulnerability. The inmate is then assessed upon various other criteria (including, but not limited

to, violence or gang-related activity in prison or disciplinary misconduct at BOP within the past

year; risk of recidivism; presentation of a demonstrated and verifiable reentry plan that will prevent

recidivism and maximum public safety; verification that the release plan would present a lower

risk of contracting COVID-19 than the inmate would face in his or her BOP facility; and the

inmate’s offense of conviction and the assessment of danger posed by the inmate to the

community). 5      Should the staff recommend home confinement is appropriate, that

Home Confinement As Appropriate in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic (March 26, 2020),

recommendation then goes to the Residential Re-entry Management Office at the BOP Regional

Office for final approval.

       Although inmates at institutions having a high incidence of COVID-19 infections were

given first priority, the Attorney General mandated that the review should include all at-risk

inmates. 6 As of January 19, 2021, BOP has placed 20,480 inmates on home confinement

(including those who have completed their sentences) pursuant to this authority. 7

                                         III.    ARGUMENT

       ANDRADE has not established that he satisfies the requirements of 18 U.S.C. § 3582.

“[A] court may reduce a term of imprisonment under the compassionate release provision if it: (1)

finds that extraordinary and compelling reasons warrant the reduction; (2) finds that the defendant

will not be a danger to the safety of any other person or the community; and (3) the sentencing

factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. §3553(a) weigh in favor of reduction.” United States v. Khawaja,

471 F.Supp.3d 426, 429 (D.N.H. 2020); United States v. Miamen, 2020 WL 19044490 at *2 (D.R.I.

April 17, 2020). “The court has ‘broad discretion in deciding whether to grant or deny a motion

for sentence reduction.’” Khawaja, 471 F.Supp.3d at 429 (D.N.H. 2020) (citation omitted).

Defendant cannot satisfy any of the three prongs of the standard.

       A. Andrade Cannot Satisfy The First Prong Because He Has Tested Positive And Has
          Refused The Vaccine.

       The government does not minimize the risks COVID-19 presents to the defendant or other

prisoners serving prison sentences. The Department of Justice is mindful of the concerns created

by COVID-19, which is why BOP is making extensive efforts to move as many appropriate

inmates to home confinement as possible. Nevertheless, despite these initiatives, ANDRADE does

not qualify for home confinement.

       As to the “extraordinary and compelling” reasons, Defendant argues that he has “risk

factor[s] for severe illness if infected by the COVID-19 coronavirus.” Def.’s Mot. at 1. The

government acknowledges that some of Defendant’s medical conditions, specifically his obesity,

makes him more vulnerable to COVID-19 and that this issue might constitute an extraordinary and

compelling reason justifying release under the statute on a different set of facts. In such a set of

facts, ANDRADE would not have tested positive and refused the vaccine. These two conditions

fundamentally change the analysis.

               1. Testing Positive Substantially Reduces One’s Likelihood Of Reinfection

       While incarcerated at FCI Fort Dix, ANDRADE tested positive for COVID-19 on

December 28, 2020. Exhibit A. Despite his underlying health conditions, nothing in his medical

records suggests that he suffered from any complications or adverse symptoms as a result. While

the scientific community’s understanding of COVID-19 is still evolving, there is significant

scientific support for the idea that a person who is infected with COVID-19 is likely to develop

some degree of immunity against reinfection. As the CDC has stated, “cases of reinfection with

COVID-19 have been reported, but remain rare.”            CENTERS    FOR   DISEASE CONTROL     AND

PREVENTION, Reinfection with COVID-19, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-

health/reinfection.html (last updated Oct. 27, 2020).

        Case 1:17-cr-10304-PBS Document 79 Filed 03/24/21 Page 12 of 21




       Courts have affirmed the conclusions by the CDC and have refused to render a risk of

reinfection as an extraordinary and compelling reason within the definition of 18 U.S.C.

§ 3582(c)(1)(A). See United States v. Rivera-Valle, No. 19-10476-RGS, 2021 WL 102646, at *1

(D. Mass. Jan. 12, 2021) (Stearns, J.) (COVID-19 infection “greatly reduces, although may not

entirely eliminate” inmate’s risk of being reinfected); see also United States v. Acevedo, No. 12-

10120-NMG, 2021 WL 242021, at *1 (D. Mass. Jan. 25, 2021) (Gorton, J.) (noting that cases of

COVID-19 reinfection are reportedly rare); United States v. Perry, __ F. Supp.3d __, 2021 WL

       As a result, courts have repeatedly held that compassionate release is not warranted or

permissible for a defendant who has tested positive and recovered from COVID-19. See, e.g.,

(“This Court and others have declined to find ‘extraordinary and compelling circumstances’ in

cases where defendant has a prior COVID-19 diagnosis”) (quoting United States v. Williams, No.

11-CR 172, 2020 WL 6826740, at *6 (D. Conn. Nov. 20, 2020)); United States v. Delorbe-Luna,

Aug. 11, 2020) (“While it is unfortunate that defendant suffered from COVID-19 while in custody,

contraction of a disease generally does not constitute an extraordinary and compelling basis for

point of releasing an individual is to decrease the person’s chance of contracting COVID-19.”);

United States v. Mateus, No. 14 Cr. 504 (KPF), 2020 WL 5096062, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 28, 2020)

(“Put simply, Mr. Mateus has already contracted the COVID-19 virus and recovered from it. Other

courts have denied compassionate release requests on this basis, and the Court is persuaded by

their analyses.”); see also United States v. Cabrera, No. 18- 304-01, 2021 WL 411502, at *4 (E.D.

Pa. Feb. 5, 2021) (collecting cases); United States v. Gianelli, __ F.Supp.3d __, 2021 WL 149368,

at *2 (D. Mass. Jan. 15, 2021) (Gorton, J.) (listing additional cases).

       With respect to an inmate like ANDRADE who has recovered from his COVID-19

infection, the Government recognizes that some courts have shifted their focus to evaluating the

inmate’s ongoing need for, and adequacy of, ongoing medical treatments rather than assessing the

potential risk of harm to the inmate if he or she were to contract the COVID-19 virus in the first

instance. See, e.g., United States v. Pena, No. 18-CR-640 (RA), 2021 WL 396420, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.

Feb. 4, 2021) (“When a defendant who has already contracted the coronavirus moves for

compassionate release, courts have tended to focus more on the defendant’s present need for

medical treatment and adequacy of the treatment that he is receiving, as opposed to the usual

emphasis on the potential risk to him or her – particularly due to one or more underlying health

conditions – if he or she were to contract the virus”) (internal quotations omitted). Here, there is

nothing in ANDRADE’s medical records reflecting any serious complications arising from his

recovery from COVID-19. Thus, while the Government recognizes the challenges and potential

impact on prisoners of the necessary precautionary measures that BOP has taken in response to

the pandemic, nothing in the unique circumstances and context of this defendant warrants his

release prior to the completion of his sentence.

               2. Courts Have Held That A Defendant Cannot Assert A Right To Compassionate
                  Release When Offered And Refused Vaccination.

       BOP has made significant strides in administering the COVID-19 vaccine to ensure that

those most vulnerable remain safe from infection. This is especially clear from BOP’s 92%

administration rate. ANDRADE was offered the COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on January

21, 2021. 2020-21 BEMR at 22, 29. This particular vaccine is 95% effective in preventing

transmission of the virus. Information about the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, CENTERS

FOR    DISEASE      CONTROL      AND     PREVENTION,       https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-

ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html. However, ANDRADE declined his

opportunity to be vaccinated. Ex. B. In other words, ANDRADE declined his opportunity to be

95% protected from the virus in environment he contends is conducive for transmission.

       When a defendant is offered the vaccine and refuses, an overwhelming majority of courts

have found that extraordinary and compelling circumstances warranting compassionate release

cannot exist. See, e.g., United States v. Martinez, No. CR18023901PHXSPL, 2021 WL 718208,

at *2 (D. Ariz. Feb. 24, 2021) (holding that, because Defendant had contracted and then “refused

the vaccine, th[e] Court has found that fact undercuts the argument that risk of serious illness from

contracting COVID-19 is ‘an extraordinary and compelling reason for his immediate release.’”)

(citing United States v. Williams, No. CR1701279001PHXDLR, 2021 WL 321904, at *3 (D. Ariz.

Feb. 1, 2021)) United States v. Jackson, No. 15CR2607PAMTNL, 2021 WL 806366, at *2 (D.

Minn. Mar. 3, 2021) (“[Defendant’s] decision to refuse the vaccine flies in the face of any medical

recommendation regarding the vaccines. While he is within his rights to refuse any treatment he

wishes to forego, he cannot simultaneously claim that he must be released because of the risk of

complications while refusing a vaccine that could virtually eliminate that risk.”); United States v.

Robinson, No. CR 16-94, 2021 WL 719658, at *1 (W.D. Pa. Feb. 23, 2021) (“[R]efusal is notable,

                                                 14
        Case 1:17-cr-10304-PBS Document 79 Filed 03/24/21 Page 15 of 21




however, given the widescale desperation − of many in the general public − to acquire the same

opportunity he has declined. . . . [I]t seems fair to conclude that his decision significantly

undermines the foundational premises of his Motion [for compassionate release].”); United States

v. Reynoso, No. CR 17-10350-NMG, 2021 WL 950081, at *2 (D. Mass. Mar. 12, 2021) (stating

that “the sincerity of [a defendant’s] concern for his health is dubious given that he rejected the

opportunity to receive the COVID-19 vaccine” and rejecting the motion for compassionate release

on these grounds); United States v. Darrell Newton, No. 1:17-CR-00073-JAW-1, 2021 WL

966862, at *8 (D. Me. Mar. 15, 2021) (finding that, when an obese defendant who had previously

contracted COVID refused the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and then claimed to be in fear of

complications from reinfection, their position is contradictory).

       ANDRADE’s arguments, as sympathetic as they may be, are significantly weakened by

his refusal to be vaccinated. It would be paradoxical to allow a Defendant to refuse a vaccine and

ignore the mitigating factors that could help stem one’s risk. Additionally, it would undermine the

legitimacy of this court if a defendant could create a workaround where they were able to refuse a

measure designed to keep them safe and then claim that “extraordinary and compelling” reasons

exist for their release. Thus, this court should find that there are not, and cannot, be compelling

reasons for his release given that he has tested positive and refused to receive the 95% effective

Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination.

       B. ANDRADE Has Received Adequate Medical Care While Incarcerated and His
          Underlying Medical Conditions Appear to Be Well-Controlled

       COVID-19 remains a relatively new disease and much continues to be learned about the

disease on a daily basis. The CDC is regularly reviewing and revising the risk profile for

individuals with certain underlying medical conditions as more data is collected and analyzed.




                                                15
           Case 1:17-cr-10304-PBS Document 79 Filed 03/24/21 Page 16 of 21




Based upon this review, the CDC has identified certain individuals, based upon their increased age

and/or preexisting medical conditions, who are at an increased risk of severe illness.

       The CDC currently has identified the following preexisting medical conditions of placing

individuals at any age “at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19: cancer; chronic kidney

disease; COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease); down syndrome; heart conditions, such

as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies; immunocompromised state

(weakened immune system) from solid organ transplant; obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 30

kg/m2 or higher but < 40 kg/m2); severe obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2); pregnancy; sickle cell disease;

smoking; and Type 2 diabetes mellitus.” See CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL, People with Certain

Medical Conditions, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-

with-medical-conditions.html (last accessed March 24, 2021) (emphasis in original) (hereinafter

“CDC COVID-19 Guidance”). While ANDRADE does have an underlying health conditions of

obesity, as is indicated by his BMI of 33.1, he suffered no significant adverse consequences even

after being infected with COVID-19. 2019-20 BEMR at 1. To the contrary, his records indicate

that he remained relatively healthy even immediately following his diagnosis, maintaining a stable

blood pressure. 2020-21 BEMR at 3. Additionally, the records reflect that ANDRADE continues

to receive appropriate routine care and that his medical conditions are well-managed and under

control.

       ANDRADE cites to other health issues including “pre-diabetes, heart murmurs, shortness

of breath and gastro-intestinal issues.” 8 See Def.’s Mot. at 3. However, these medical ailments are



       8
         None of these medical conditions present an increased risk of serious illness should an
individual contract COVID-19. In fact, these conditions have not even been identified by the
CDC as conditions that “might” place an individual at an increased risk for severe illness were
they to contract COVID-19. See CDC COVID-19 Guidance (emphasis in original).

                                                16

not particularly uncommon for someone in their mid-50s and “while [certain underlying medical

conditions that do not present a significant risk of COVID-19 complications are] understandable

concerns, they are not ‘extraordinary and compelling.’” United States v. Hardy, 470 F. Supp.3d

61, 62 (D. Mass. 2020) (Stearns, J.); see also Rivera-Valle, 2021 WL 102646, at *1 (concluding

that obesity is “neither uncommonly grave nor life-threatening” and that defendant did not meet

“extraordinary and compelling” threshold requirement for compassionate release). Other courts

have similarly concluded that “nothing in the guidelines promulgated by the Centers for Disease

Control and Prevention (“CDC”) suggests that pre-diabetes puts one at a higher risk for severe

illness from infection. United States v. Livingston, No. 18-CR-416 (ENV), 2020 WL 1905202, at

*3 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 17, 2020);see also United States v. Gonzalez, 467 F. Supp. 3d 1075, 1082 (D.

Colo. 2020) (holding that obesity and heart murmurs do not qualify as conditions warranting

compassionate release because they are neither extraordinary nor compelling). As such, not even

ANDRADE’s obesity necessitate a finding of an extraordinary and compelling reason for his

release.

       C. The Outbreak of COVID-19 at FCI Fort Dix Is Not an “Extraordinary and
          Compelling” Basis for Compassionate Release

       The measures that the BOP has adopted to combat the COVID-19 virus have proven

successful to varying degrees at its facilities throughout the country. Unfortunately, despite BOP’s

best efforts, there have been outbreaks of the virus at a number of facilities including FCI Fort Dix.

According to the BOP website, FCI Fort Dix, as of March 24, 2021, has three inmates and 41 staff

who have confirmed COVID-19 infections, and has 1,821 inmates and 47 staff who have recovered

from earlier COVID-19 infections. 9              See BUREAU       OF   PRISONS, Covid-19 Cases,



       9
           The facility has unfortunately also reported one inmate death as a result of COVID-19.

                                                 17
         Case 1:17-cr-10304-PBS Document 79 Filed 03/24/21 Page 18 of 21




https://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/ (last visited March 24, 2021). While obviously cause for

concern, these numbers suggest that the situation at FCI-Fort Dix has improved dramatically over

the past two months. Compare United States v. Johnson, No. 2:08-374, 2021 WL 409830, at *9

(W.D. Pa. Feb. 5, 2021) (observing that as of January 4, 2021, there were 586 inmates and 12 staff

with active cases of COVID-19 at Fort Dix). “BOP’s highest priority is to continue to do

everything it can to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in its facilities, and it has taken significant

measures to protect the health of the inmates in its charge.” Cabrera, 2021 WL 411502, at *2

(internal quotation omitted).

        As this Court and several other courts have recognized, a COVID-19 outbreak within an

institution, while unfortunate and troubling, is not, in and of itself, a sufficient basis for granting

compassionate release to all inmates within that institution. “[T]here must be a means of

differentiating those eligible for release from those who are not.” Hardy, 470 F. Supp.3d at 62;

see also Rivera-Valle, 2021 WL 102646, at *2. “Because COVID-19 poses a general threat to

every non-immune individual, the mere existence of the disease does not provide a basis for a

reduction in sentence on its own.” Id. at *4.

        Thus, even at institutions where there has been a COVID-19 outbreak, compassionate

release of all inmates at the affected institution is not warranted. See, e.g., United States v. Altashy,

No. CCB-17-182, 2021 WL 409743, at *3 (D. Md. Feb 5, 2021) (finding that the defendant’s

underlying tuberculosis condition was not “extraordinary and compelling” and that the conditions

at FCI Fort Dix did not provide grounds for a reduction in sentence); Johnson, 2021 WL 409830,

at *9 (denying request for compassionate release where defendant had already contracted COVID-

19, but was asymptomatic, and rejecting argument that the conditions at FCI Fort Dix constituted

an extraordinary and compelling reason supporting defendant’s compassionate release).

       D. The § 3553(a) Sentencing Factors Support ANDRADE’s Continued
          Incarceration

       Even if ANDRADE’s medical conditions provided an extraordinary and compelling reason

warranting consideration for compassionate release, which they do not, he must still demonstrate

that his proposed release is “consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing

Commission.” 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A). This requires consideration of the factors expressed in

18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)—including, inter alia, “the nature and circumstances of the offense; the

history and characteristics of the defendant; the need for the sentence imposed to provide the

defendant with needed . . . medical care or other correctional treatment; the applicable guidelines;

and pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statements.” 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).

       The scale tips heavily in favor of his continued incarceration.         Most significantly,

ANDRADE is a Career Offender who bargained for, and received, a sentence below the Guidelines

range. He also faced three separate mandatory minimum terms: ten years for the drugs (Count

One); 15 years on the felon in possession charge (Count Two); and another five years for the

924(c), consecutive to Count One (Count Three). ANDRADE earned this ranges by possessing a

huge amount of drugs – fentanyl, cocaine base, and cocaine – and drugs.

       E. Public Safety Requires ANDRADE’s Continued Incarceraton.

       ANDRADE is a repeat offender with a long history of drug dealing, including fourteen

prior arrests, one additional pending charge, and a criminal history score of 10. PSR at ¶ 30–47.

Ten of these offenses involved possession or possession with intent to sell drugs, which form a

pattern with the instant offense. PSR at ¶ 44. Not only is ANDRADE’s risk of recidivism

theoretically high given his classification, there is a strong indication that, given his repeat

offenses, he would recidivate. For example, ANDRADE was arrested in 2003 for possessing with

intent to distribute a class D drug near a school zone or park. PSR at ¶ 33, 34. He even served

                                                19
        Case 1:17-cr-10304-PBS Document 79 Filed 03/24/21 Page 20 of 21




time for this offense. PSR at ¶ 33, 34. Five years later, in 2008, he was arrested and served time

again for possession with intent to distribute a Class B drug. PSR ¶ 39. Most recently, in 2014,

ANDRADE was arrested for possession with intent to sell Class A (Heroin), Class B (Cocaine),

and Class D drugs near a school zone or park. PSR at ¶ 47. 10

       Despite Defendant’s claim of rehabilitation, ANDRADE continues to violate the law

shortly after his release. Given the similarity of the instant offense to his prior convictions, it

remains highly probable that ANDRADE will continue to carry large quantities illicit substances

that harm our communities. For instance, he was most recently arrested for possession with intent

to distribute heroin and cocaine, and this offense involved fentanyl and cocaine, some of the

deadliest drugs. Additionally, the instant matter, ANDRADE was found to be in possession, and

close proximity to a firearm despite being a convicted felon. Not only did this aggravating factor

put law enforcement at risk, it risks harm to the community. There is no question that such conduct

presents an untenable risk of harm to the community were he to be released at this time. And given

his track record of possession with intent to distribute dangerous drugs. it is likely that he will

continue to do so upon his release. This conduct belies any claim that ANDRADE presents no

risk of harm to the community were he to be released at this time.

                                          IV.    CONCLUSION

       The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented public health emergency that has caused

great concern throughout the world. It does not, however, require the release of all federal inmates.

ANDRADE dealt with significant quantities of cocaine, profited off the addiction of others, and

demonstrated a disregard for the law over an extended period of time.
