       On December 18, 2014, this court held a final revocation hearing. At the hearing,

Defendant Jason Watson admitted the alleged violation and requested an opportunity to

participate in a residential drug and alcohol treatment program. In order to provide Defendant an

opportunity for such treatment prior to a determination on the revocation petition, the court

   4. Upon receipt of this Order, the U.S. Marshal shall release Defendant under the following

       conditions:

                    escorted by his mother, Margaret Watson, to the U.S. Probation Office,

                    595 Main Street, #302, Worcester, MA 01608 for processing. Defendant

                    shall then be escorted directly from U.S. Probation to Gosnold Treatment

                    Center.

             II.    Defendant shall reside at the designated residential alcohol and drug

                    treatment facility pending further order of the court.

             III.   Defendant shall not leave the premises of the designated residential

                    alcohol and drug treatment facility until January 23, 2015.

             IV.    Defendant shall be escorted by a member of his family to the courthouse

                    on January 23, 2015.

             V.     Defendant shall refrain from the use of alcohol.

             VI.    Defendant shall refrain from the use or unlawful possession of a narcotic

                    drug or other controlled substances defined in 21 U.S. C. § 802, unless

                    prescribed by a licensed medical practitioner.

             VII.   Defendant shall comply with all previously imposed conditions of

                    supervised release as directed by probation, except the special conditions

                    imposed in this court’s March 28, 2012 Revocation Judgment [#100] that

                    (1) Defendant reside with his sister, and (2) Defendant abide by a curfew.

                    All other previously imposed conditions of supervised release shall remain

                    in effect.

      IT IS SO ORDERED.

                                                                     /s/ Indira Talwani
