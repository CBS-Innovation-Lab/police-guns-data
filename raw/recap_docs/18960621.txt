                        UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                             DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

               v.                                     Criminal No. 10-cr-120-01-JL

Raymond Alleyne


                                             ORDER


       The assented to motion to reschedule jury trial (document no. 10) filed by defendant is

granted. This court disfavors 90-day continuances, but will allow this one based on defense

counsel's convalescence, as well as the other factors stated in the motion. No further

continuances. Final Pretrial is rescheduled to February 11, 2011 at 10:00 AM; Trial is continued

to the two-week period beginning March 8, 2011, 9:30 AM.

       Defendant shall file a waiver of speedy trial rights within 10 days. The court finds that

the ends of justice served by granting a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and

the defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv), for the reasons set forth in the

motion.

       SO ORDERED.


                                                      _______________________________
