                         DEFENDANT’S SENTENCING MEMORANDUM


         Mr. Roscoe stands before the court having pled guilty to a one count indictment charging

Felon in Possession of a Firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). Mr. Roscoe asks that the

Court impose a sentence of 18 months with 2 years of Supervised Release to follow.

         The factors found in § 3553(a) support the Defendant’s sentencing recommendation as

sufficient, but not greater than, necessary. 1

    I.      Nature and Circumstances of this Offense

         The charged offense is the result of a traffic stop. Robert was the backseat passenger in a

vehicle of friends. There is no allegation that any of the occupants in the vehicle were engaged in

any wrongdoing prior to the arrival of the police. The crime in question is Robert’s choice to

keep a firearm on his person, despite a felony conviction which prevents him from possessing

such a weapon.




1 This sentence is consistent with the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) and will result in a sentence
that is sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to effectuate the purposes of sentencing. United States

Martin, 520 F.3d 87 (1st Cir. 2008); United States v. Rodriguez, 527 F.3d 221 (1st Cir. 2008).

         While the statement of offense conduct is correct, that there had been a call of suspicious

activity in the area, that call was made several hours earlier and involved a different vehicle, a

silver Mercedes-Benz, not the vehicle the driven by Mr. Maximo.

         It is the uncharged conduct – specifically the way Robert reacts when confronted by

police – that is also troubling. However, we ask the Court to consider Robert’s history with the

police, his fear of future incarceration, and his history within his community, to help understand

why he would overreact in the way that he did. He has been forthcoming with the Court and the

probation department in explaining why he possessed a firearm on that date.

   II.      History and Characteristics of the Defendant

         Robert Roscoe would describe his childhood as very normal; his parents were loving and

caring. While they were separated, they lived only a street apart from one another. He had no

wants, he had everything he needed from his parents as a child. It was simply the location of his

upbringing that led him down a path that resulted in him possessing a firearm. While his parents

were attentive and caring, Robert has been using marijuana regularly since the age of 9. There is

no doubt that this can take a toll on the development of the brain and a young man’s decision

making. Despite Robert’s well-meaning parents who provided for him both financially and

emotionally, it is obvious how his environment has shaped his relationships and his outlook on

his life. He has seen many childhood friends die from gun violence. The police and gang activity

were an omnipresent component in his life. In his presentence interview, he described that when

he leaves the house every day he worries whether he will return home that night.

          While this is in no way an excuse for carrying a firearm, it does explain his decision on

that date. He worries about his safety because he does not want his daughter to grow up without

a father. His mother’s decision to move out of Boston and down to Attleboro was a huge shift for
             Case 1:19-cr-10145-NMG Document 55 Filed 12/07/19 Page 3 of 8



their family. For Robert’s younger siblings, this could likely spare them from exposure to many

of the dangers that he faced. This new home offers Robert an opportunity to build a life outside

of Boston. Robert has been evaluating how to manage his anxiety surrounding his pending

sentencing and future return to the community. He has discovered that listening to classical

music allows him to let go of the stressors in his life. When he is inside in a multi-person cell, he

will turn on classical music when the chaos of the prison becomes too much.

            Sadly, Robert has a short-sighted vision of his future. This is because of the violence he

has seen and the medical problems he suffers from, which are outlined at ¶¶ 69-71 in the PSR.

These medical issues cause Robert to present as much older than he actually is. Even though he

is only 28, his goals are short term. He wants to be alive to see is daughter turn 30, to see her get

married and be independent. He does not think about his life after this. He has lost too many

people and struggles with too many health problems to imagine a future for himself where he

lives into old age.

           Over the years Robert has tried to find a way to connect with his community in a positive

manner. He was a Roca participant, participating in social justice circles of peers who faced the

same challenges that he did. He loved working with Roca, particularly with then Director

Shannon McAuliffe. We provide for the Court a letter from Roca confirming his participation

and describing the work of the organization. This is where Robert’s future lies; finding a path to

give back to his community by using his challenging experiences to help others. 2

    III.      Guideline Range

           We would propose that the Court calculate Robert’s guideline range in this case

differently from that proposed by the Probation Department because (1) we ask the Court to

reject the scoring of what would now be a juvenile conviction and (2) we ask the Court to reject

the scoring of a marijuana conviction. We propose that the guideline in this case should be 15-21

months.

        a. Juvenile Convictions.

        The conviction appearing at ¶ 35 in the PSR, occurred on December 6, 2008, when

Robert was 17 years old. In 2013, Massachusetts changed the age at which young people were

prosecuted as adults, increasing the age to 18. The United States Sentencing Commission has

stated, citing recent developments in the Courts and in neuroscience research, that the

Commission has defined youthful offenders as 25 years old or younger at the time of sentencing.

The Commission included individuals up to age 25 because “there is a growing recognition that

people may not gain full reasoning skills and abilities until they reach age 25 on average.” 3

While the Commission is talking about defendant’s charged in federal court who fall within this

age bracket, a common sense analogy can be drawn from the way that a Defendant’s criminal

history is evaluated as well.

        While ultimately not adopted, in 2017 the Commission considered an amendment to

§4A1.2 that excluded all prior juvenile adjudications and eliminated the distinction based on

length of sentence served. This amendment was supported by the defense community for a

number of reasons, namely (1) young people are less culpable than adults; (2) juvenile

adjudications are less reliable than adult convictions due to fewer procedural protections; (3) the

length of a juvenile disposition is a poor proxy for the seriousness of a prior offense, and is not

comparable to the length of a sentence imposed in an adult criminal conviction; and (4)

publications/2017/20170525_youthful-offenders.pdf, page 5.
           Case 1:19-cr-10145-NMG Document 55 Filed 12/07/19 Page 5 of 8



excluding these adjudications may have an ameliorative effect on the disproportionate impact of

the criminal history rules on racial minorities. 4

        In tandem with the Sentencing Commission’s evaluation of youthful offenders as

including young people up to age 25, many advocates of the youth caught up in the criminal

courts are pushing for an even higher increase to the age of majority, citing the same data

concerning the developing brain and the unique trauma that young people suffer from

incarceration. Citizens for Juvenile Justice has proposed legislation to change the manner in

which ‘emerging adults’ interact with the court system that would help young people achieve

better outcomes and reduce recidivism.

        When sentenced for the offense in ¶ 35, in January of 2009, Robert, still 17 years old,

was sent to MCI Cedar Junction. “The conditions of confinement often exacerbate symptoms of

mental disorder, including PTSD.”5 The traumatic events that Robert has experienced in his

community; the death, the violence, are part and parcel of why we are before this Court now on

these charges. “Reliance on incarceration does not meet the needs of youth offenders who have

suffered trauma. Indeed, it exacerbates trauma and is counterproductive to longterm community

safety goals.”6

        After Roper v. Simmons, 7 Courts have been open to rethinking how and to what extent

the development of the juvenile brain should affect appropriate sentencing and punishment.

Citing Atkins, the Supreme Court found that juveniles can be “categorically less culpable than

the average criminal.” 8 The American Psychological Association, in a 2008 report, found that

…[p]articularly before the age of 15, adolescents appear to display psychosocial immaturity in at

least four areas: poor resistance to peer influence, attitudes toward and perception of risk, future

orientation, and impulse control.” 9 “The case for psychosocial immaturity during adolescence is

also supported by evidence from developmental neuroscience indicating that the brain structures

of adolescents are less well developed than previously thought.” 10

         While Robert is 28 now, more than half (6, out of 10) of his criminal history points were

earned before he turned 20.

         b. Marijuana Conviction

    Mr. Roscoe was convicted of the offense described at ¶ 40 and received a 26 day, deemed

served sentence, 11 for possession with intent to distribute 2 bags of marijuana that was found in

his mother’s home. It is likely that Robert would not be prosecuted for this same offense at all

today.

         Were the Court to adopt our application of the guidelines, the base offense level would be

14, reduced by 2 for acceptance, for a total of 12. If the Court did not score the offenses at ¶¶ 40

and 35, the criminal history category would be III. This would result in a range of 15-21 months.

         Our recommendation considers the framework of the United States Sentencing

Guidelines, is sufficient to promote respect for the law, and serve the purpose of punishment,

rehabilitation, and deterrence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553, while recognizing the circumstances

in this case. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(l) provides that "[t]he court shall impose a sentence sufficient,

but not greater than necessary, to comply with the [following] purposes[:] .... (A) to reflect the

seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide a just punishment for

the offense; (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) to protect the public from

further crimes of the defendant; and (D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or

vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner."

18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1) provides that "[t]he court, in determining the particular sentence to be

imposed, shall consider the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and

characteristics of the defendant." See also Rita v. United States, 127 S. Ct. 2456, 2473 (2007).

       Furthermore, our alternative calculation of the guideline and suggestion that the Court

consider a range of 15-21 months as more accurately capturing the seriousness of the offense and

the likelihood of recidivism, can be viewed as a downward departure. The guideline range

suggested by the Probation Department is merely a starting point, and one factor, of many, for

the Court to consider in evaluating an appropriate sentence.

       Conclusion

       For these reasons, we ask this Court to sentence Robert Roscoe to 18 months, with

supervised release to follow.
