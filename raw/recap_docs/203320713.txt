              reached the following agreement:
                   1.        Defendant's Obligations.

                             a.    Defendant will plead guilty to Counts I and II of

              the Indictment, which charge Defendant with two counts:
              Count I - possession of a firearm after a felony conviction in
              violation of 18 U.S.C.         §   922(g) (1);
              Count II - possession of marijuana               w~th    intent to distribute in
              violation of 21 U. s. C.       §   841 (a) (1) and (0) (1) (D); and
                                                                        .
                             b.    Defendant agrees that if the United States Probation
              Department determines that U.S.S.G.               §    2Dl.1(b) (1) applies to the
              guidelines calculation defendant will not contest that
              determination.
                   2.        Government's Obligations.              In exchange for Defendant's

                                                            a.          The government wil.l recommend that the court impose
                          a term Of imprisonment at the                                 low~st       point of sentences for the
                          offense level determined by the Court under the United States
                          sentencing Guidelines (the U.S.S.G. or "guidelines") or at the
                          statutory mandatory minimum, whichever is higher, but not
                          inclucUng probation or a "split-sentence,                                      II   even if permitted under
                          the guidelines.
                                                            b.          For purposes of determining the offense level, the
                          government agrees to recommend                                 ~       two-level reduction in the
                          offense level for acceptance of responsibility under                                           §    3E1.1(a) of
                          the gUidelines if Defendant continues to demonstrate acceptance of
                          responsibility through sentencing.                                        As of the date of this
                         agreement, Defendant has timely notified authorities of an
                          intention to enter a plea of guilty.                                       If the offense level is 16
                         or greater and Defendant enters a plea of gUilty pursuant to this
                         agreement, the government will move the sentencing Court for an
                         additional decrease of one level, pursuant to U.S.S.G .                                              §

                         3El.l(b) (2), unless Defendant indicates an intention not to enter
                         a plea of guilty, thereby requiring the government to prepare for

                         trial.
                                                           c.          The government agrees not to file an information
                         alleging prior convictiona pursuant to 21 U.S.C.                                          §   851.       The
                         detendant understands that because the government has agreed not
                         to file an information alleging prior convictions the defendant


                                                                                             2

                  avoids the possibility that the maximum penalties on Count II
                  would be a term of imprisonment of 10 years/ a fine of $500,000, a
                  term of supervised release of at least 4 years and up to five
                  years, and a special assessment of $100.
                                  d.    The government agrees to dismiss Count III which
                  alleges violation of 18 U.S.C.          § 924(C)   (1) (A) (i) at the time of
                  sentencing.
                                  e.    The government is free to recommend any combination
                  of   supervised release, fines, and restitution which it deems
                  appropriate.
                       3.        Defendant understands that the guidelines are not

                  ~inding       on the Court, and that, although the Court must consult
                  the guidelines in fashioning any             sen~ence   in thig case, the
                  gUidelines are only advisory, and the Court may impose any
                  reasonable sentence in this matter up to the statutory maximum
              penaltieg after taking into account the factors enumerated in 18
                  U.S.C.    §   3553(a).

                       4.        Except as expressly provided in the preceding
              paragraphs, there is no agreement as to which· Offense Level and
              Criminal History Category applies in this case.                   Both the United
              States and Defendant            ~eserve   their rights to argue and present
              evidence on all matters affecting the guidelines calculation,
              consistent with this agreement.

                                    f.            Defendant waives these trial rights if the Court
                                                  accepts his plea of guilty.
                       8.         Defendant is advised that the government has in its
                  possession certain physical evidence.                   Defendant understands that
                  the government does not intend to conduct DNA testing of any of
                  this evidence.                   Defendant further understands that Defendant could
                  request DNA testing Of such evidence in this case prior to any
                  finding of guilt against Defendant.                   Defendant further understands
                  that, fOllowing this Court's entry of a judgment of conviction for
              the offense to which Defendant is pleading guilty, Defendant has
              the right to request DNA testing of such evidence pursuant to 18
              U.S.C.        §    3600.

                                    Knowing and understanding this right to request such DNA
              testing, Defendant hereby knowingly and voluntarily waives and




2008-1G-2114:43                         7095005                                                      Page 6
              gives up that right.   Defendant understands that Defendant will

              never have another opportunity to have the evidence in this case
              submitted for DNA testing or to employ the results of DNA testing
              to support a claim that Defendant is innocent of the offense to
              which Defendant is pleading guilty.     Defendant further understands
              that by waiving and giving up this DNA testing right, the physical
              evidence in this case need not be retained for any such purpose.
                   9.    The government reserves its full right of allocution,
              including the right to present any information to the Court for
              its consideration in fashioning an appropriate sentence, the right
              to correct misstatements, misrepresentations, or omissions by
             Defendant, and to answer any questions asked by the Court.
                   10.   Defendant understands that the Court a.lone makes all
              sentencing decisions, including the application of the guidelines
              and the sentence to be imposed.     The Court is not bound by the
             parties' stipulations of fact, offense level adjustments, or the
             government's recommendations.      The Court is free to impose any
              sentence it deems appropriate up to and including the statutory
             maximum.    Defendant also understands that even if the Court's
             guideline   d~terminations   and sentence are different than Defendant
             expects, Defendant will not be allowed to withdraw
             Defendant's plea of guilty.
                   11.   Defendant understands that Defendant may have the right
              to file a direct appeal from the sentence imposed by the Court.
