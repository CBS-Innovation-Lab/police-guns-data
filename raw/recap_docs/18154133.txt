                   RECOMMENDED DECISION ON 28 U.S.C. § 2255 MOTION

       Petitioner Jeremy Bender has moved, through counsel, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255, to

vacate, set aside or correct his sentence. (Motion, ECF No. 62.) Petitioner cites Johnson v.

United States, --- U.S. ---, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015), as the basis for relief. (Motion at 1.)

       Petitioner was convicted in 2001, following a jury trial, of four counts of being a felon in

possession of several firearms, 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g)(1), 924(e)(1); the Court subsequently

sentenced him to 293 months in prison on each of the counts, to be served concurrently, followed

by five-year concurrent terms of supervised release. (Jury Verdict, ECF No. 33; Judgment, ECF

No. 37.) United States v. Bender, 304 F.3d 161, 162-63 (1st Cir. 2002). The First Circuit affirmed

the conviction. 304 F.3d at 162.

       Petitioner filed his first section 2255 motion in 2004; the Court denied relief. Bender v.

United States, No. 2:04-cv-00013-DBH (D. Me. Oct. 21, 2004) (order adopting recommended

decision). Given Petitioner’s 2004 section 2255 motion, which concerned the same underlying

criminal judgment and which was decided on the merits, the section 2255 motion now pending in

this Court (ECF No. 62) is a second or successive such motion, and thus it is subject to the

gatekeeping requirements of 28 U.S.C. §§ 2244, 2255(h).
    Case 2:99-cr-00027-DBH Document 69 Filed 07/25/16 Page 2 of 4                                             PageID #: 68



           Counsel has filed a status report (ECF No. 68), which states that Petitioner recognizes that

his section 2255 motion is subject to gatekeeping requirements. In the status report, Petitioner

requests that the Court transfer the section 2255 motion to the First Circuit.

           This Court lacks jurisdiction to consider a second or successive section 2255 motion unless

the First Circuit has specifically authorized a petitioner to proceed on the motion. Title 28 U.S.C.

§ 2244 applies to second or successive section 2255 motions, pursuant to section 2255(h). Section

2244(b)(3)(A) states: “Before a second or successive application permitted by this section is filed

in the district court, the applicant shall move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order

authorizing the district court to consider the application.” See also First Circuit Rule 22.1. The

First Circuit has held: “We have interpreted [section 2255(h)] as ‘stripping the district court of

jurisdiction over a second or successive habeas petition unless and until the court of appeals has

decreed that it may go forward.’” Trenkler v. United States, 536 F.3d 85, 96 (1st Cir. 2008)

(quoting Pratt v. United States, 129 F.3d 54, 57 (1st Cir. 1997)).

           Because the record lacks any evidence that the First Circuit has authorized Petitioner to

proceed in this Court on the pending motion, the Court is without jurisdiction to consider the merits

of the motion. First Circuit Rule 22.1(e) provides that if a second or successive section 2255

petition is filed in the district court without the required authorization from the First Circuit, the

district court “will transfer the petition to the court of appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1631 or

dismiss the petition.”1 The issue, therefore, is whether the Court should dismiss or transfer the

matter.

    Title 28 U.S.C. § 1631 states:

           Whenever a civil action is filed in a court as defined in section 610 of this title or an appeal, including
           a petition for review of administrative action, is noticed for or filed with such a court and that court
           finds that there is a want of jurisdiction, the court shall, if it is in the interest of justice, transfer such
           action or appeal to any other such court in which the action or appeal could have been brought at
           the time it was filed or noticed, and the action or appeal shall proceed as if it had been filed in or

                                                                 2
    Case 2:99-cr-00027-DBH Document 69 Filed 07/25/16 Page 3 of 4                                    PageID #: 69



         Insofar as Petitioner relies on the Supreme Court’s ruling in Johnson to support his motion,

and given the one-year limitations period for filing Johnson-related motions, transfer is

appropriate.2 See United States v. Barrett, 178 F.3d 34, 41 n.1 (1st Cir. 1999) (holding that transfer

is not mandated, but noting “that transfer may be preferable in some situations in order to deal

with statute of limitations problems or certificate of appealability issues”); In re Watkins, 810 F.3d

375, 378 (6th Cir. 2015) (noting that the district court had transferred to the circuit court, pursuant

to section 1631, a second or successive section 2255 motion for the circuit court to consider

whether to authorize the motion as a second or successive section 2255 motion).

                                                   CONCLUSION

         Based on the foregoing analysis, I recommend the Court transfer the pending section 2255

motion to the First Circuit, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1631 and First Circuit Rule 22.1(e). I further

recommend that the Court deny a certificate of appealability pursuant to Rule 11 of the Rules

Governing Section 2255 Cases because there is no substantial showing of the denial of a

constitutional right within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).


         noticed for the court to which it is transferred on the date upon which it was actually filed in or
         noticed for the court from which it is transferred.

First Circuit Rule 22.1(e) states:

         If a second or successive § 2254 or § 2255 petition is filed in a district court without the requisite
         authorization by the court of appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(3), the district court will
         transfer the petition to the court of appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1631 or dismiss the petition. If
         the petition is transferred, the petitioner must file a motion meeting the substantive requirements of
         Loc. R. 22.1(a) within 45 days of the date of notice from the clerk of the court of appeals that said
         motion is required. If the motion is not timely filed, the court will enter an order denying
         authorization for the § 2254 or § 2255 petition.

  The transfer statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1631, provides that the “action or appeal shall proceed as if it had been filed in or
noticed for the court to which it is transferred on the date upon which it was actually filed in or noticed for the court
from which it is transferred.” In this case, Petitioner’s counseled motion was filed on June 27, 2016. Counsel was
appointed on June 28, 2016. (Order, ECF No. 63.) On July 11, 2016, Petitioner filed a pro se section 2255 motion;
the signature on that filing alleges that Petitioner placed the motion in the prison mailing system on June 23, 2016.
(Pro se Motion, ECF No. 66 at 5.) The cover letter that accompanied the pro se motion bears the date of June 23,
2016. (Letter, ECF No. 66-1.) The envelope in which the pro se motion was sent to the Court has a postmark of
July 6, 2016. (Envelope, ECF No. 66-2.)
