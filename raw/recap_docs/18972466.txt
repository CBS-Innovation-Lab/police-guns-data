                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                        DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

     v.                                   Criminal No. 10-cr-159-01-JL

Guy Velez


                                  O R D E R


     On March 29, 2011, the defendant appeared for a bail

revocation hearing pursuant to 18 U.S.C. ' 3148.

     The background is as follows: Defendant is charged with

Aiding and Abetting the Making of a False Statement During the

Acquisition of a Firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 2; and 18

U.S.C. ยง 922(a)(6).       On November 22, 2010, defendant was

released on bail following his initial appearance in this court.

     The government alleges that since defendant's release on

bail in November, he has essentially been a fugitive.             Since his

initial failure to report in January and February, defendant has

disappeared from his supervising officer's radar screen and has

not responded to telephone (and other) inquiries from his

supervising officer.       Defendant has failed to report to his

supervising officer, failed to attend drug testing, and,

ultimately, failed to submit to supervision.            When deputies of

the U.S. Marshal located defendant, defendant did not submit
       Case 1:10-cr-00159-JL Document 14 Filed 03/29/11 Page 2 of 4




voluntarily to arrest.    The deputies were able to place

defendant under arrest only after a "foot pursuit."          Prior to

his arrest, defendant was aided in his efforts to flee by the

deceit of his acquaintances.

     A request to revoke bail is governed by 18 U.S.C. ' 3148,

which provides in part:

     The judicial officer shall enter an order of
     revocation and detention if, after a hearing, the
     judicial officer--

     (1) finds that there is-

          (A) probable cause to believe that the person has
          committed a Federal, State, or local crime while
          on release; or

          (B) clear and convincing evidence that the person
          has violated any other condition of release; and

     (2) finds that--

          (A) based on the factors set forth in section
          3142(g) of this title, there is no condition or
          combination of conditions of release that will
          assure that the person will not flee or pose a
          danger to the safety of any other person or the
          community; or

          (B) the person is unlikely to abide by any
          condition or combination of conditions of
          release.

18 U.S.C. ' 3148 (b)(1)-(2).     The government has the initial

burden to establish the violation under 18 U.S.C. ' 3148 (b)(1).

If the government establishes probable cause to believe the

defendant committed a new "felony" offense on release, a

rebuttable presumption arises that no condition or combination

of conditions will assure that the person will not pose a danger

to the safety of any other person or the community.          18 U.S.C. '

3148(b)(2).   Otherwise, the government typically has the burden

to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the requirements of

section 3148 (b)(2)(A) or (B).      Aron, 904 F.2d at 224; United

States v. Poinsett, 953 F. Supp. 37, 38 (N.D.N.Y. 1997).

    In this case, defendant conceded that the government had

sufficient evidence to establish probable cause that he violated

the conditions of his bail as charged.       Thus, the only question

before the court was whether to release the defendant.           With

respect to bail, the defendant did not dispute the government's

offer of proof but urged the court to release him on electronic

monitoring.   For all of the reasons stated on the record, and

based on the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. ยง 3142(g), the court

finds that there are no conditions or combination of conditions

of release that will assure that defendant will not flee.             Based

on his recent attempt to flee from arresting officers and his

fugitive status, defendant is not a reliable candidate for

electronic monitoring.

      Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the defendant be detained.

The defendant is committed to the custody of the Attorney

General or his designated representative for confinement in a

corrections facility separate, to the extent practicable, from

persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody

pending appeal.     The defendant shall be afforded a reasonable

opportunity for private consultation with defense counsel.             On

order of a court of the United States or on request of an

attorney for the government, the person in charge of the

corrections facility shall deliver the defendant to the United

States Marshal for the purpose of an appearance in connection

with a court proceeding.

      SO ORDERED.
