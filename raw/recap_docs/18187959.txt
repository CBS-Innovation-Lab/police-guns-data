            ORDER ISSUING CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY


      On November 3, 2016, I DENIED Casey’s motion to correct his sentence
under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (ECF No. 68). In accordance with Rule 11 of the Rules
Governing Section 2255 Cases in the United States District Courts and 28 U.S.C.
§ 2253(c)(2), however, I hereby issue a certificate of appealability finding that
Casey’s petition contains a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional
right. Specifically, Casey’s petition raises the following issues: (1) whether the
retroactive application of Johnson v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015),
allows any petitioner serving an ACCA sentence to have his qualifying “violent
felony” convictions re-examined even if those convictions appear to fall under the
ACCA’s enumerated clause, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e); and (2) if so, whether Mathis v.
United States, 136 S. Ct. 2243 (June 23, 2016), has effectively overruled the
First Circuit’s decision in United States v. Duquette, 778 F.3d 314 (1st Cir.
2015), that a Maine burglary conviction, 17-A M.R.S.A. § 401, qualifies as a
violent felony under the ACCA’s enumerated clause, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e).

      SO ORDERED.

      DATED THIS 9TH DAY OF NOVEMBER, 2016
