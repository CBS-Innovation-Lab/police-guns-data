               ORDER AFFIRMING RECOMMENDED DECISION
                      OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE


      On December 6, 2017, the United States Magistrate Judge filed with the
court, with copies to the parties, his Recommended Decision on 28 U.S.C. § 2255
Motion. The time within which to file objections expired on December 20, 2017,
and no objection has been filed. The Magistrate Judge notified the parties that
failure to object would waive their right to de novo review and appeal.
      It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the Magistrate
Judge is hereby ADOPTED. An evidentiary hearing is not warranted under Rule
8 of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Cases. The petitioner’s motion for habeas
relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 is DENIED. No certificate of appealability shall issue
pursuant to Rule 11 of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Cases because there
is no substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right within the
meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).

      SO ORDERED.

      DATED THIS 21ST DAY OF DECEMBER, 2017

                                               /S/D. BROCK HORNBY
