WILLIAM LELAND                         )


                     ORDER ON MOTION FOR TRANSFER

      William Leland returns with his tenth post-judgment motion, this time

requesting that the Court order the Bureau of Prisons to transfer him from his

current place of incarceration to another federal facility.    The Court denies the

motion because it does not have the jurisdiction to order such a transfer.

I.    STATEMENT OF FACTS

      On October 28, 2005, the Court sentenced William Leland to concurrent

terms of 252 months incarceration for multiple drug trafficking crimes and one

firearms count. J. (Docket # 334).

II.   MOTION FOR ORDER OF TRANSFER

      On February 23, 2007, Mr. Leland, who is currently incarcerated in New

Jersey, wrote the Court asking that it use its influence with the Bureau of Prisons

to have him transferred to the newly-opened federal prison in Berlin, New

Hampshire. Mot. for Order of Transfer (Docket # 387).

      The Court has no such influence. As the Court recently explained to Mr.

Leland:
       Mr. Leland is under a misimpression about the Court having classified
       him for Bureau of Prison (BOP) purposes. Under federal law, once the
       Court imposes a sentence, the BOP assumes legal authority over the
       prisoner. 18 U.S.C. § 3621(a) (“A person who has been sentenced to a
       term of imprisonment . . . shall be committed to the custody of the
       [BOP] until the expiration of the term imposed, or until earlier
       released for satisfactory behavior . . . .”). The Court does not have the
       authority to designate the place of imprisonment; the BOP does. 18
       U.S.C. § 3621(b). The Court does not have the authority to classify a
       prisoner; the BOP does. 18 U.S.C. § 3621(b). In short, the Court
       cannot reclassify Mr. Leland because it did not classify him.


Order on Mot. to Am. Presentence Report at 3 (Docket # 384).            Congress has

expressly given the BOP, not the courts, the authority to “designate the place of the

prisoner’s imprisonment.” 18 U.S.C. § 3621(b). In making this evaluation, the BOP

considers a number of factors, including any recommendation that the sentencing

court may have made at the time of sentencing regarding the “type of penal or

correctional facility as appropriate.”    18 U.S.C. § 3621(b)(4)(B); United States v.

Cintron-Fernandez, 356 F.3d 340, 356 (1st Cir. 2004). But the BOP is free to reject

the recommendation of the sentencing judge. United States v. Boutot, 480 F. Supp.

2d 413, 419-20 (D. Me. 2007).        Once a person is incarcerated, the BOP has a

procedure under which an inmate such as Mr. Leland may request a transfer and

the inmate must exhaust BOP procedure before seeking judicial review. See 28

C.F.R. § 542.10; Anderson v. Miller, 772 F.3d 375, 378 (7th Cir. 1985). The Court

urges Mr. Leland to use the procedures the BOP has established to make his case

for being placed in a facility closer to his family.

       To address one final point, Mr. Leland attaches to his motion an article from

the Bangor Daily News, which describes an inmate who was returned to Maine

                                             2
State Prison from incarceration in the state of Florida. Id. Ex. 2. But the article

clearly states that the decision to move the state of Maine inmate from Florida to

Maine was made not by a judge, but by the Commissioner of the Maine State

Department of Corrections. Id. Just as in the Maine State system, Mr. Leland

must turn to the BOP, not this Court, for the relief he is requesting.

      The Court DENIES William Leland’s Motion for an Order of Transfer (Docket

# 387).

      SO ORDERED.
