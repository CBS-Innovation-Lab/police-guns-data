                                    ORDER

WILLIAM E. SMITH, Chief Judge.

      On      May    12,   2014,   United    States   Magistrate   Judge

Lincoln D. Almond issued a Report and Recommendation (ECF

No.     235)    in     the     above-captioned     matter.      Therein,

Magistrate Judge Almond recommended that this Court deny

Petitioner Domingo A. Gonzalez’s Motion for Leave to Appeal

in Forma Pauperis.           Gonzalez has filed an objection to the

R&R (ECF No. 236).

      Gonzalez’s objection is without merit. The objection

simply rehashes arguments already rejected by this Court in

denying Gonzalez’s Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct

Sentence under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.             Because this Court agrees

with the R&R's conclusion that Petitioner's appeal is not

taken    in    good    faith    based   on   the   frivolous   nature   of

Petitioner's claim, it hereby accepts the R&R pursuant to
28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1). Petitioner's Motion for Leave to

Proceed IFP is DENIED.

IT IS SO ORDERED.
