P R O C E E D I N G S

(The following proceedings were held in open court
before the Honorable George A. O'Tooler Jr., United States
District Judge, United States District Courtr District of
Massachusetts, at the John J. Moakley United States Courthouse,
1 Courthouse Way, Boston, Massachusetts, on December 1, 2005.

The defendant, Crandall Rack, is present with
counsel. Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Moore is present.)

THE CLERK: All rise. United States District Court
for the District of Massachusetts, court is now in session.
Please be seated. For sentence, case of United States of
America versus Crandall Rack, which is docket number CR
04-10300. Would counsel please identify yourselves for the
record.

MR. MOORE: Good afternoon, your Honor. Paul Moore
for the United States.

MR. SPENCER: Good afternoon. Gordon Spencer on
behalf of Crandall Rack.

THE COURT: Mr. Rack appears this afternoon for
imposition of sentence on his conviction of possession of
cocaine base with the intent to distribute, that following a
trial. I have a final presentence report. The parties have
had an opportunity to review?

MR. MOORE: Yes, your Honor.

MR. SPENCER: Yes, your Honor.

THE COURT: The report, of course, sets forth the
statement of the offense conduct, And is there any issue with
respect to that that needs to be corrected or --

MR. MOORE: Not from the government.

THE COURT: -- or added tO?

MR. SPENCER: I don't believe so, Judge.

THE COURT: The PSR also proposes a computation
under the guidelines of what would be the guideline range. And
I note there were no formal objections.

PROBATION OFFICER: Your Honor, yesterday I sent up
to you objections that were filed by the defendant.

THE COURT: You did, did you?

PROBATION OFFICER: I did. And I can give you a
copy of it.

THE COURT: 'How did you send them?

PROBATION OFFICER: However it comes upstairs.

THE COURT: Interstate mail -- interstate. I mean
interoffice mail?

PROBATION OFFICER: Interoffice mail.

THE COURT: I didn't see them. I‘ll take a look at
them.

(Pause.)

THE COURT: Okay. I think the -- I guess the
question is whether the proposed computation correctly

determines the base offense level according to the table in

line with the trial findings. Do you want to address that?

MR. SPENCER: Sure. Judge, I would submit that
there is an inaccurate guideline calculation, and my objections
note this more specifically. And, for the record, I believe
that the more accurate guideline should be a base level 14 with
a category level II. The reason being is because what has
elevated the offense level up to a 26 would be a finding that
there was 5.89 grams of crack, cocaine base, in the possession
of Crandall Rack, a fact which was tried before this Court,
which was the finder of fact, a jury or judge, but it was
rejected beyond a reasonable doubt standard. I‘d submit based
upon Apprendi, as well as Booker, that that is the fact that
speaks to sentencing and the fact -- and at least my
understanding of Apprendi is that the sentence has to be
authorized by the verdict. That being said, Judge, I would
submit that the verdict doesn't authorize this elevation in the
calculations of the guidelines.

THE COURT: So what would your computation of the
guidelines be, a calculation of the --

MR. SPENCER: It would be possession with intent to
distribute, which is a base offense level of 12. And then we
add two points for possession of a dangerous weapon, which
would bring him to 14. And then I believe he's a category
level II, which would bring him to 18 to 24.

THE COURT: Why do you start with a level 12?

MR. SPENCER: My understanding of possession with
intent to distribute starts at a base level 12, and then it
moves upwards depending on the weight of the drugs. That‘s my
understanding.

THE COURT: Can you give me a citation to -~

MR. SPENCER: I could cite United_£tates_ni_

Green --
THE COURT: No, but just under the guidelines.
MR. SPENCER: Which would be the lowest level,
quite frankly, for the -- it starts at a base -- my

understanding of the guidelines, possession with intent to
distribute starts at a base level 12 and then moves upward in
increments of two based on the weight of the drugs.

THE COURT: Okay, I see what you're saying I
think. In the drug table the first appearance of cocaine base
is at level 12.

MR. SPENCER: That's correct.

THE COURT: I see.

MR. SPENCER: And that's what I'm arguing.

THE COURT: Is it your view that there's no amount
that should be attributed?

MR. SPENCER: Well, no, Judge. And I think it
would -- I would be misstating the evidence because we know
that there was an amount of crack cocaine or cocaine base. The

argument is, though, is that the issue that spoke to the

sentencing factor was that it was over five grams. That was
rejected. So that now at this juncture, I think it would be
inappropriate to now say for terms or in terms of sentencing
now we're going to say there was, in fact, five grams when the
jury or Court verdict actually spoke against that.

THE COURT: No, you don't have to say there was

7five grams. You can say there was something less than five

grams but close to it. But anyway, let me hear from the
government.

MR. MOORE: Your Honor, the -- the government
believes that quantity is a sentencing issue to begin with.
The standard is preponderance of the evidence. The Court found
in the trial that above five grams was not proven beyond a
reasonable doubt, and l believe the Court was very specific in
the words it used on that occasion. And my understanding of
Apprandi is it doesn‘t implicate minimum mandatories, only when
the statutory maximum is implicated is Apprendi involved in a
case like this, and then would have to be proven beyond a
reasonable doubt.

The government believes that the evidence that was
presented at trial, which included two weighings, one was 5.64,
one was 5.71, is sufficient to establish for the Court's
purposes that it was above five grams. And I would accede the
one objection of the defense regarding paragraph 8, which goes

to the .18 grams, the sale which had just occurred, the person

spat out. There was some testimony as to the substance that
was spat out. And so -- but if the Court wants to toss that
.18 in its considerations, l don't particularly think it's
either here nor there because the evidence of two weighings
that were presented, even though I believe the Court may recall
the government's expert witness you described, l believe, as
somewhat bizarre --'

THE COURT: l said that?

MR. MOORE: Yes, your Honor.

THE COURT: I do recall that I had little
confidence in her testimony.

MR. MOORE: Wellr something like that. l tried to
make that into a virtue. But nonetheless, and given her
bizarre appearance in some ways, there wasn't really any
substantive attack. In fact, the attack that was presented
through the defense expert's statistician was that it was just
simply too close and too good to be true that the actual
weighing could come so close to the estimated weighing.

But in this case, the defendant is suggesting that
the Court simply say, well, we'll just drop down to .250
milligrams, which is the lowest that you could go to to get the
level 12. I don't know where that figure comes from. It's
just sort of reaching in the air like this. And the government
would respectfully request that if the Court determines that

the amount is below five grams given the two weighings that

existed, how is it that the Court could simply reach some other
figure if there's something there, given the government's
proof. And l would argue that there's certainly nothing to
suggest that the Court should drop down anywhere near .250
milligrams in this case.

I don't know if the Court wants me to address
anything else.

THE COURT: Go ahead, Mr. Spencer.

MR. SPENCER: I would submit that there was by way
of the defense case some indication that some appropriate
amount could be determined other than over five grams. That
would be the testimony of Dr. Grimson, who l believe testified
that there was a margin of error of approximately 2.5 grams. l
actually ordered the transcript. l believe it's somewhere in
the courthouse -- l don't have it -- if the Court actually
needed the transcript to refresh its recollection as to what
Dr. Grimson testified to.

The margin of error would give the Court
conceivably another alternative weight. We know again that the
verdict spoke and that it's not beyond a reasonable doubt of it
being over five grams. If there's margin of error of 2.5
grams, that would put the weight at approximately 2.5, assuming
that you're not going margin of error over five grams, which
would be 7.5, Judge. But I would submit that l don't think the

defendant should be faulted by the mere fact that based upon

the verdict there is no alternative weight. The government

stuck to its guns with respect to we're trying to prove over
five gramsr all or nothing. They were unable to prove that

beyond a reasonable doubt.

I've read -- and, quite frankly, l think my efforts
on trying to get up to speed with federal sentencing laws has
been very arduous just because I don't do much federal criminal
litigation. But l have read Apprendi, I have read Green, I
have read Matta. I‘ve actually read a couple of cases coming
out of the District of Massachusetts, district court cases, and
l believe that Booker supports now the proposition that
acquitted conduct, if it's going to be considered, should be
held to the standard implicated by the Fifth Amendment, which
is proof beyond a reasonable doubt, not preponderance of the
evidence.

I would also submit that to consider acquitted
conduct, and that's what we're talking about, to consider
acquitted conduct against Mr. Crandall Rack violates the spirit
of Apprendi in the sense that the jury's verdict authorizes, I
would submit, the sentence or in this case the Court's
verdict. I think and l believe the government is recommending
95 months, which is almost ten years. If the Court were to
adopt that guideline calculation, in effect it just eviscerates
what the verdict spoke to with respect to the weight of the

drugs.

THE COURT: Okay, no. l do think, as Mr. Moore
argues, there is a difference -- a significant difference in
the standards of proof at trial and at sentencing. And it is
the case that -* well, the evidence -- the government had
evidence which might have persuaded a finder of fact by a
preponderance of the evidence but failed to persuade me as the
finder of fact by the requisite degree of certainty; that is,
that I had no reasonable doubt about the reliability of the
weighings. And so that was the reason I was -~ l found as I
did. And it's not just an academic exercise between two
standards because there was a direct consequence of -- a
potential direct consequence of the finding beyond a reasonable
doubt in that it created the mandatory minimum.

So it was an important issue as to which the
government bore the burden of proof andr as I found, had not
sustained it on the evidence. It's another question, I think,
what amount of illegal drugs should be taken account of in
deciding what punishment is merited given the crime of
conviction, which is possession with intent. So l think the
questions are separable. Not only technically in that there
are different burdens, but in the purposes of the two findings.

So l think that the proposed computation is the
correct one in the PSR, notwithstanding that he was not found
guilty of the crime of possessing more than five grams. The

more-likely-than-not fact is that there were more than five

grams involved in the possession for purposes of scaling the
punishment to fit the crime. So l will -- l will adopt the
computation as set forth in the guidelines. That yields a
level 28, l believer and a category II, which has an 87-108
range.

Now, of course, what makes that all permissible
under Booker is that it is not mandatory but advisory. So that
to answer on the arguments made by Mr. Spencer, that's why
BQler does not invalidate it because the otherwise applicable
maximum sentence is still 20 years, as it is for all of the
offenses, any offense. But anyway, so that's the range.

Now the question is under the statute, what is the
appropriate sentence to give effect to the statutory factors
under 3553(a), including among those factors what the
guidelines would propose as a proper sentence for this
offense? So as to that, I'll hear your recommendations.

Mr. Moore for the government.

MR. MOORE: Thank you, your Honor. The government
would recommend a sentence of 87 months imprisonment, four
years of supervised release, a fine of $12,500 and mandatory
special assessment of $100. Regarding the fine, I‘m unaware of
any -~ and forgive me if I haven't seen something in the
documents -- but I'm unaware of any representation that the
defendant's unable to pay. And correct me if I'm wrong in

terms of the defendant's financial status. I've seen the job

history but I believe -- l can't make any representation. I
think that's the defendant's responsibility. If the Court
finds the defendant is unable to pay. the government would
agree that no fine's appropriate. And a special assessment of
$100.

THE COURT: Mr. Spencer.

MR. SPENCER: I would submit that, and my client
specifically is requesting, a sentence of 24 months be
imposed. We know that's a remarkable disparity with respect to
what the government is recommendingr but we do believe that 87
months is greater than necessary to achieve`the goals of
sentencing in this purpose.

Judge, you look at his PSR, you know that he's 25
years of age. And for the first 22 years of his lifer he's
never had a brush with the law. From the ages of zero to 18 he
basically lived all of his life with his mother, who is present
in the courtroom and who, as you know, testified in this case.
He's a graduate of high schoolr and at the age of 18 back in
1998 -- and I think it's fair to say that at least at that
juncture we could have assumed that Mr. Rack was on his way to
a productive member of society -- he had no juvenile record to
note, no criminal record or adult record at that present time.
He also began employment working two jobs during his 18th year,
one at Tufts and the other one at UPS. Then that continued on

throughout his adult life until 2002 whenr again, he had other

jobs and he wasn't involved in any criminal activity.

We know then in 2002 his grandfather suffered a
massive heart attack and was paralyzed as a resultr requiring
him and his mother to contribute to his care basically around
the clock. llt seemed from that point on there was a change
that you noticed, at least with respect to his exposure to
criminal activity with Mr. Rack. We saw that he picked up a
couple of cases in the district courts, one for marijuana where
he received a continuance without finding. And then he picked
up another charge out of the district court, which was
ultimately picked up by the federal governmentr and he was
indicted. There‘s another pending matter, and I can say
because l represent Mr. Rack on that case that is a matter that
is involving possession of a firearm. That matter was
dismissed as of two days ago out of the Boston Municipal
Court.

80 as far as where we stand presently, Judge,

Mr. Rack is a first-time, convicted felon, I think, for all
intents and purposes. At the time of this arrest, he had no
prior criminal convictions. This is not a situation where this
person's been given chance after chance after chance, where he
has been exposed to the criminal justice system and just
refused to get in compliance, refused to fly on the straight
and narrow. l would submit that we have a situation where --

and I‘ve spoken to Mr. Rack about this and he says he wakes up

every day in his cell and he wonders and he looks at himself
and says why am l here, this is not me, I basically don't
belong here. Obviously it took a federal indictment for him to
wake up to this fact, quite frankly, your Honor.

But the point is, and l think I can say in my
humble, feeble opinion, that l believe Mr. Rack, that he does
truly believe that he doesn't belong here, that he's better
than that. And l think that a sentence, a stiff sentence, by
the way of eight years for a first-time, convicted felon
doesn't necessarily have to be, meaning it's not a necessary
sentence in order to ensure that this person has, in fact,
accepted responsibility and would be an appropriate
deterrence. I would submit that something along the lines of,
againr 24 months, your Honor, would be more than sufficient.
And then obviously supervised release after that fact to
achieve the goals of sentencing in this case.

l would submit that Mr. Rack has accepted
responsibility by way of -- although he did take his case to
trial, but he would like to address the Court and tell you that
he did, in fact, accept responsibility for what he felt was
something he never should have gotten involved in in the first
place. You learned from the trial that he was shot in the year
of 2004r which we're not saying serves as any excuse, your
Honor, but I think Mr. Rack got himself intertwined in a

culture that started contributing to his demise.7 Fortunately,

l think we've caught him early because l think Mr. Rack has
changed since this conviction.

And, again, 85 months, Judge -- 87 months is
something l think very extreme and very severe in light of the
circumstances. We have a situation where there was one alleged
transaction that took place on the streets of Boston involving
an undefinable amount of cocaine base. I just think -- and l
know that the guidelines are advisory now and l think that -- l
can only say that l listened to the prior sentencing hearing
and I heard about it -- I'm not trying to compare those facts
directly against these facts, but l did hear about a person
receiving 12 months, And that was actually authorized under
the guidelines for seven separate drug transactions where we
saw evidence of a persistent participation in a life that spoke
to danger to the community. What we have here is one isolated
drug transaction that involved, again, an undefinable quantity
of cocaine base. And now Mr. Rackr first-time offender, is
looking at 87 months, l think that a period of 24 months with
supervised release would be more appropriate in these
circumstances.

THE COURT: Mr. Rack, you have the opportunity to
address me before I decide on the sentence.

THE DEFENDANT: How you doing, Judge O'Toole.
Basically l would like to say I've been convicted of carrying a

gun and selling cocainer which I can't deny. l did make a sale

and I did have a gun, but I never had a gun to protect, never
had a`gun to harm anyone, just basically to protect myself. I
was just a victim of violence. And I know it seems crazy to, I
guess, to basically be a victim of crime and then turn to
crime, l know it seems crazyr but only being in my shoes you
can understand the situation. I had ~- 87 months, it is harsh
but if that's what I will get, I have no choice but to take
that. But l just -- all this is overwhelming to me as much as
you. My crime I don't think in my eyes is a federal crime
really, and for me to get so much time for so little isr in my
opinion, is outrageous. But I guess it's the law.

But basically what I'm saying is l am sorry for
everything that happened. I never meant to hurt nobody. But l
guess at the time l felt like what I was doing was rightr but
now I see it wasn't. But only thing I could say is I'm sorry
and l never meant for things to be like this. And whatever
your decision is, I have to live with that.

THE COURT: Under the sentencing statute, Section
3553(a) the task is to impose a sentence that is sufficient but
not greater than necessary to reflect the seriousness of the
offense, to promote respect for the law, provide just
punishment, afford adequate deterrence, protect the public and
so on. And the guidelines, considering some of those same
factors, have a method of proposing a range of sentence by

taking account of a number of factors. And, in particularr in

a drug case like this, among them are two very significant
factors, which is the quantity of the drugs and the presence of
a firearm.

The general theory of the guidelines drug table is

`it's more serious to possess greater quantities. That's not an

irrational thought. The guidelines also -- and Mr. Rack in
this case was acquitted of the accusation that he carried the
firearm during and in relation to the drug crime, but there's
no question he still possessed a firearm. His record indicates
a prior event in the BMC, I think it was the BMC, where he
possessed a firearm. That's certainly worth taking note of.

Because the drug table provides progressive
escalation by the quantities. it can -- let me start that
sentence again. The drug's reliance on progressive staircasing
by reference to the quantities can be useful. lt recognizes
the right principle, but it also can be overly mechanical. And
the assessment of how serious the offense is by reference to
that single factor alone, which is the main driving factorr l
think can result in something that is perhaps more than
sufficient and greater than necessary. And I think that would
be the case with an 87-month sentence here. l don't think 24
months adequately accounts for the offense here. thoughr either
and l think an appropriate sentence will be a 60-month
sentence.

Because it is a serious offense, it is an offense

by someone who has a history, although relatively minor, of use
of a firearm and l think that will be appropriate. Given

Mr. Rack‘s age. l think what will effectively be another three
and a half to four years incarcerated will give him an
opportunity to confirm what he tells us, that this has gotten
his attention and his life will change. I think that's a
period that will give him that opportunity but will not overdo
it, as I think an 87-month sentence would.

l think that the -- as I say, I think the
guidelines have to be respected and considered carefully in
these matters because l think they do try to take account of
the sentencing factors in the statute. Every case has to be
addressed on its own terms, and the general adequacy of the
guidelines, including the drug table to predict an appropriate
range, does not mean it will always be the case. And l think
that it's smart in this case to go slightly below what the
table will require.

MR. SPENCER: Judge,.may I be heard?

THE COURT: Go ahead.

MR. SPENCER: Just for the record, I just wanted to
clarify the Court's ruling with respect to the finding of the
weight of the drugs. Was it the Court's ruling that by a
preponderance of the evidence the Court found --

THE COURT: In excess of five grams.

MR. SPENCER: Thank you.

THE COURT: For the purposes of the guideline
calculation only.

MR. SPENCER: Okay.

THE COURT: Mr. Rack, if you'd stand, please.

Pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, upon
your conviction of these -- of this offense, it is the judgment

While you are on supervised release, you shall
comply with all the standard conditions that pertain to that
status. Those conditions are set forth in the United States
Sentencing Guidelines at Section 5Dl.3(c) and they‘re
incorporated by reference. You're prohibited from possessing a
firearm, destructive device, or other dangerous weapon. If
directed to do so by the probation office, you shall
participate in a program for substance abuse treatment or
counseling and may be required to contribute to the costs of
any such program based on your ability to pay or the
availability of third-party payment. There is a mandatory
special assessment in the sum of $100, which is due forthwith.

MR. SPENCER: He wanted me to request the drug
program.

THE COURT: While institutionalized?

MR. SPENCER: While institutionalized.

THE COURT: I'll add that recommendation to the
Bureau of Prisons. I don't know if the 500 hour -- or with the
firearm charge it may not -- actually, it's not a charge. He
was acquitted of the firearm possession. He may be eligible.

PROBATION OFFICER: He may be eligible. His drug
history isn‘t such as some of the other defendants, but he may
be eligible.

THE COURT: The recommendation can be for the

500-hour program?
