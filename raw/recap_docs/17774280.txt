      B    Total Amount of Restitution:

      C    Restitution not ordered (Check only one.):

                 o	   For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 V.S.c. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of
                      identifiable victims is so large as to make restitution impracticable under 18 US.C. § 3663A(c)(3)(A).

           2     o	   For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 V.S.c. § 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
                      issues offact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims' losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
                      that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 USc. § 3663A(c)(3)(B)

           3     o	   For other offenses for which restitution is authorized under 18 US.c. § 3663 and/or required by the sentencing guidelines, restitution is not
                      ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh
                      the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 US.c. § 3663(a)( 1)(B)(ii)

           4     o	 Restitution is not ordered for other reasons.   (Explain.)




      D    0     Partial restitution is ordered for these reasons (18 u.s.c. § 3553(c)):
