                 o	   For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 V.S.c. ยง 3663A, restitution is not ordered because the number of

           2     o	   For offenses for which restitution is otherwise mandatory under 18 V.S.c. ยง 3663A, restitution is not ordered because determining complex
                      issues offact and relating them to the cause or amount of the victims' losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree
                      that the need to provide restitution to any victim would be outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process under 18 USc. ยง 3663A(c)(3)(B)

                      ordered because the complication and prolongation of the sentencing process resulting from the fashioning of a restitution order outweigh
                      the need to provide restitution to any victims under 18 US.c. ยง 3663(a)( 1)(B)(ii)
