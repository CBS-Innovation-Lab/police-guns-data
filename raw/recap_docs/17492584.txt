WILLIAM E. SMITH, United States District Judge.

       On March 16, 2010, Defendant Michael Avila pleaded guilty

to    being   a    felon      in   possession   of    a   firearm.        Defendant

thereafter filed an objection to his presentence report (PSR).

A sentencing hearing was held on October 1, 2010.                       The hearing

was continued pending the First Circuit's decision in United

States v. Holloway, 630 F.3d 252 (1st Cir. 2011), which was

expected to impact the Court's ruling on Defendant’s objection.

Holloway was decided on January 21, 2011, and a continuation of

Defendant's sentencing hearing was held on March 1, 2011.                        In

light of Holloway, the Court indicated that it would continue

the   balance      of   the    sentencing     hearing     and   issue    a   written

decision      on    Defendant’s       objection      before     proceeding     with

additional argument.

       It has now come to the Court’s attention that the First

Circuit has a pending case, United States v. Dancy, No. 09-2628,


                                          1
that squarely presents the issue argued by Defendant in his

objection.   According to the government, the First Circuit heard

argument in Dancy on February 7, 2011.

     The   Court   has   determined       that   a   ruling   on   Defendant’s

objection should be postponed until Dancy is decided.                 At that

time, the Court will hold a hearing and will rule on Defendant’s

objection.



IT IS SO ORDERED.
