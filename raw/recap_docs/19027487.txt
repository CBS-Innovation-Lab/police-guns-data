                 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                      DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America,
      Plaintiff

            v.
                                    Case No. 13-cr-23-01-SM

Christian Gonzalez,
      Defendant

                                ORDER


      Defendant Gonzalez’s Motion to Continue the final pretrial

conference and trial until the September 2013 trial period is

granted (document no. 25). Trial has been rescheduled for

September 17, 2013 trial period.       Defendant Gonzalez shall file

a waiver of speedy trial rights not later than June 10, 2013.

On the filing of such waiver, his continuance shall be

effective.

      The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting

a continuance outweigh the best interest of the public and the

defendant in a speedy trial, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A) and (B),

in that failure to grant a continuance would unreasonably deny

the defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence

under the circumstances.
