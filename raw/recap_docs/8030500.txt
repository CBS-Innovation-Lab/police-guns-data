                           MOTION FOR SENTENCE CONSIDERATION

        Now comes Eean Johnson, the Defendant in the above captioned matter, and moves this

Honorable Court, pursuant to Local Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 (2006), to consider and impose

a sentence that is sufficient, but not greater than necessary, in compliance with18 U.S.C. 5 3553(a).

In Unitedstates v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220,125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), the Supreme Court struck down the

mandatory element of the sentencing guidelines, rendering them advisory only. 125 S. Ct. at 755-56.

The Court must now sentence Mr. Johnson pursuant to 18 U.S.C. $3553(a) in a reasonable manner.

Id. at 765-68. After considering all the appropriate information present in this case, the Court should

conclude that the advisory guidelines call for a sentencelonger than what is sufficient to comply with

18 U.S.C.     5   3553(a). Mr. Johnson proposes a sentence in the range of 48 to 54 months of

incarceration followed by a period of supervised release.
