                     UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                        DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE



United States of America

             v.                               Case No. 08-cr-129-01 SM

Anthony Rabbia



                                     ORDER

       The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the trial scheduled for

July 20, 2010 and the change of plea hearing scheduled for July 16, 2010 for a period

of 45 days, citing a scheduling conflict. The government does object to a continuance

of the trial date.

       Accordingly, for the above reasons, the court will continue the trial from July

20, 2010 to September 21, 2010. In agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds

pursuant to 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(7)(A) that for the above-stated reasons, the ends of

justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the best interests of the public and

the defendants in a speedy trial. The defendant shall file a waiver of speedy trial not

later than July 22, 2010.
