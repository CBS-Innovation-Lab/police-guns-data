                 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                      DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

            v.                                Case No. 07-cr-53-01-SM

Timothy McComas-Lowe

                                    ORDER

      Defendant McComas-Lowe’s motion to continue the final pretrial

conference and trial is granted (document 16). Trial has been rescheduled for

the September 2007 trial period. Defendant McComas-Lowe shall file a

waiver of speedy trial rights not later than May 30, 2007. On the filing of such

waiver, his continuance shall be effective.

      The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18

U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would

unreasonably deny defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances.

      Final Pretrial Conference: August 24, 2007 at 4:00 p.m.

      Jury Selection: September 5, 2007 at 9:30 a.m.
