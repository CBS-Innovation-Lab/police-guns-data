                      UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
                   FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

        v.                                      Case No. 06-cr-105-PB

Vincent Chaney


                                  O R D E R

        The defendant, through counsel, has moved to continue the

trial scheduled for March 2, 2010, citing the need for additional

time to finalize plea negotiations and schedule a plea hearing.

The government does not object to a continuance of the trial

date.

        Accordingly, for the above reasons and to allow the parties

additional time to properly prepare for trial, the court will

continue the trial from March 2, 2010 to April 6, 2010.             In

agreeing to continue the trial, the court finds pursuant to 18

U.S.C.A. ยง 3161(h)(7) that for the above-stated reasons, the ends

of justice served in granting a continuance outweigh the best

interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
