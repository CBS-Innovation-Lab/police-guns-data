                          v.                                          Criminal No.: 05-109 S

           LUZ SANCHEZ

                                    AMENDED MOTION FOR RETURN OF BOND

                         Now comes the Defendant, Luz Sanchez, in the above-captioned matter, by and

          through her attorney Matthew B. Smith, Esq., and respectfully requests that this

          Honorable Court issue an order returning the bond in the amount of Two Thousand Five

          Hundred ($2,500.00) Dollars to Defendant's daughter Vivian Lozada. Ms. Lozada's

          address is 750 Side A Valley Street, Providence, Rhode Island 02908.

                         As grounds for this Motion your Defendant sets forth the following:

                         I.     The Defendant appeared before and was sentenced by the Honorable

          Court on March 17,2006. The Defendant is currently serving the sentence imposed by

          the Honorable Court. The Defendant did not appeal the sentence imposed by the

          Honorable Court.

                         2.     Therefore, the Defendant respectfully contends there is no further need for

         the Government to maintain the bond to secure the Defendant's presence before the

         Honorable Court.

               3.               The Government (A.U.S.A. Zechariah Chafee) does not object to the
         Motion.


                         WHEREFORE, your Defendant respectfully requests that this Honorable Court

        returns the money.                              Rcformd to U A M J.   P/1 fi/v
