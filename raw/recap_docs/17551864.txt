                            ORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS

        Troy Bryant moves to dismiss the indictment charging him with possession of

ammunition after having been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic

violence. He first claims that the charge infringes his Second Amendment right to

bear arms. He next contends that the indictment fails to state a federal offense

because the First Circuit‟s decision in United States v. Nason,1 which concluded that

a conviction under Maine‟s assault statute constitutes a “misdemeanor crime of

domestic violence” under federal law, is no longer binding on this Court. Instead, he

asserts that in interpreting the term, “physical force,” as it appears in the firearms

possession statute, the Court must apply the construction the United States

Supreme Court in Johnson v. United States2 and the First Circuit in United States

v. Holloway3 gave the same term for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act

(ACCA), and if it does so, the indictment must be dismissed because the Defendant

has not committed a predicate crime. The Court has previously considered and

rejected most of these arguments and does so again.        As regards Johnson and

Holloway, the Court does not consider judicial interpretations of the ACCA to be


1 269 F.3d 10 (2001).
2 130 S. Ct. 1265 (2010).
3 630 F.3d 252 (1st Cir. 2011).
sufficiently persuasive to disturb the binding power of First Circuit precedent on

the question of the definition of “physical force” for purposes of federal firearms

possession prohibitions. The Court denies the Defendant‟s motion.

I.     BACKGROUND

       A.      Procedural Background

       On February 24, 2011, a federal grand jury indicted Troy Bryant for

possessing ammunition after having been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of

domestic violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9).4 Indictment (Docket # 13).

On March 11, 2011, Mr. Bryant moved to dismiss the indictment. Mot. to Dismiss

Indictment (Docket # 20) (Def.’s Mot.).                On April 1, 2011, the Government

responded, and on April 4, 2011, Mr. Bryant replied. Gov’t’s Resp. to Def.’s Mot. to

Dismiss (Docket # 24) (Gov’t’s Resp.); Def.’s Reply to Gov’t’s Resp. to Mot. to Dismiss

(Docket # 25) (Def.’s Reply).

II.    DISCUSSION

       A.      Motion to Dismiss Indictment

       A Court should exercise its authority to dismiss cautiously since to dismiss an

indictment „directly encroaches upon the fundamental role of the grand jury.‟”

United States v. Pettengill, 682 F. Supp. 2d 49, 51 (D. Me. 2010) (quoting United

States v. Thomas, 519 F. Supp. 2d 141, 143-44 (D. Me. 2007)).                        The power is

“appropriately reserved, . . . for extremely limited circumstances. Whitehouse v.


4 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9) makes it unlawful for any person “who has been convicted in any court of a
misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, to . . . possess . . . any . . . ammunition.” According to the
indictment, Mr. Bryant was convicted in 2005 of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence in
violation of 17-A M.R.S. § 207. Indictment at 1.

                                                  2
United States Dist. Court, 53 F.3d 1349, 1360 (1st Cir. 1995). “Unless the

Government has made what can fairly be described as a full proffer of the evidence

it intends to present at trial to satisfy the jurisdictional element of the offense, the

sufficiency of the evidence is not appropriately addressed on a pretrial motion to

dismiss an indictment.” Pettengill, 682 F. Supp. 2d at 51 (quoting United States v.

Alfonso, 143 F.3d 772, 776-77 (2nd Cir. 1998)).

       B.        The Second Amendment

       Mr. Bryant first argues that 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9) violates the Second

Amendment.         Def.’s Mot. at 2-8.   He acknowledges that the Court “previously

considered, and rejected, this basis to dismiss an Indictment charged pursuant to . .

. §922(g)(9) by way of the order entered in United States v. Booker, 570 F. Supp. 2d

161 (D. Me. 2008); United States v. Wyman, 667 F. Supp. 2d 151 (D. Me. 2009); and

United States v. Pettengill, 682 F. Supp. 2d 49 (D. Me. 2010).” Def.’s Mot. at 5. He

nevertheless challenges those rulings on two grounds: (1) the rulings employed

improper levels of scrutiny; and (2) they were based on a flawed construction of §

922(g)(9). The Court stands by its constitutional analyses in those cases. As to the

latter challenge, until the First Circuit directs otherwise, the Court concludes that

its construction of § 922(g)(9) in Booker, Wyman, and Pettengill remains good law in

this District.

       C.        Failure to State a Federal Offense

       Mr. Bryant argues that the indictment fails to state a federal offense by

failing to allege a predicate crime under § 922(g)(9). To be convicted of violating §



                                            3
922(g)(9), the defendant must have been previously convicted of a misdemeanor

crime of domestic violence.          The indictment alleges that Mr. Bryant had been

previously convicted of such a crime, specifically a violation of Maine‟s assault

statute, 17-A M.R.S. § 207. However, Mr. Bryant argues that a conviction under

Maine‟s assault statute, without more, does not necessarily meet the federal

definition of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence because it does not require

the same mens rea or level of physical force.5

       Section 921(a)(33)(A) defines “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence” for

purposes of §922(g)(9) as:

       . . . an offense that—

       (i) is a misdemeanor under Federal, State, or Tribal law; and

       (ii) has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or
       the threatened use of a deadly weapon, committed by a current or
       former spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim, by a person with
       whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is
       cohabiting with or has cohabited with the victim as a spouse, parent,

5 Mr. Bryant argues that consistent with Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 595 (1990) and
Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 12, 26 (2005), the Court must employ the First Circuit‟s two-
tiered categorical approach in determining whether his prior conviction meets the definition of “use
or attempted use of physical force.” Def.’s Mot. at 8-9. The two-tiered approach turns first to the
statutory language to determine whether the statute “sweeps more broadly” than the qualifying
definition, and if so, turns next to whether the record of conviction establishes the factual basis for
the conviction. United States v. Miller, 478 F.3d 48, 50 (1st Cir. 2007). In Booker, this Court agreed
that the Taylor/Shepard approach, as refined by the First Circuit, would apply “with equal force to
determine if a person has been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence within the
meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(33).” Booker, 555 F. Supp. 2d at 223. Here, the Government attached
to its response the court documents for Mr. Bryant‟s assault conviction. Gov’t’s Resp. Attach. 1-3.
But they are unrevealing. The Government also attached a copy of the police report, which is
revealing but may not be considered under Shepard. 544 U.S. at 26; United States v. Cadieux, 500
F.3d 37, 43 (1st Cir. 2007) (“The Court, however, rejected the use of a police report as a basis for
judicial fact-finding because permitting a sentencing judge considering an [Armed Career Criminal
Act] enhancement to make a disputed finding of fact about what the defendant and state judge must
have understood as the factual basis of the prior plea raises Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment
concerns”) (internal punctuation omitted). In this case, therefore, the Court agrees with Mr. Bryant
that the court-sanctioned documents do not clarify under which level of mens rea or degree of force
Mr. Bryant acted when he committed the domestic assault.

                                                  4
       or guardian, or by a person similarly situated to a spouse, parent, or
       guardian of the victim.

17-A M.R.S. § 207 states in part:

       1.      A person is guilty of assault if:

       A.     The person intentionally, knowingly or recklessly causes bodily
       injury or offensive physical contact to another person.

Mr. Bryant contends that intentionality must be an element of the predicate crime

for the crime to fit the definition of “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence” and

observes that “recklessness” satisfies the mens rea requirement for conviction under

§ 207. Id. at 8. He further notes that one can be convicted of violating § 207 for

merely offensive contact, which he argues does not necessarily rise to the level of

“use or attempted use of physical force” within the meaning of a “misdemeanor

crime of domestic violence.”6 Id. at 8-10 (citing 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(33)(A)(ii)); Def.’s



6 Mr. Bryant discusses State v. Patterson, 2004 ME 79, 851 A.2d 521, to demonstrate how minimal
the “offensive physical contact” may be under the Maine assault statute. In Patterson, a boyfriend
arrived home to find a spot in newly-installed carpet. Id. 2004 ME 79, ¶ 3, 851 A.2d at 522. He
became irritated and commented as he attempted to clean the spot. Id. The comments provoked the
girlfriend and she took a piece of pizza and rubbed it into the carpet. Id. In response, the boyfriend
picked up his girlfriend, carried her outside, and left her there. Id. Although characterizing the
crime as of “a minimal nature,” the district judge found the boyfriend guilty of assault and sentenced
him to “simply the conviction” and a small fine. Id. 2004 ME 79, ¶ 9, 851 A.2d at 523. Although Mr.
Bryant does not mention it, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court vacated the conviction and remanded
the case based on the District Court‟s erroneous interpretation of 17-A M.R.S. § 105, which allows a
person to use nondeadly force to the extent he reasonably believed it necessary to prevent what
reasonably appeared to be an unlawful taking of his property or criminal mischief. Id. 2004 ME 79,
¶ 14-15, 851 A.2d at 524-25.
         Mr. Bryant also does not mention that after Patterson was remanded, the case returned to
the Maine Supreme Judicial Court. State v. Patterson, 2005 ME 55, 881 A.2d 649 (Patterson II).
After the initial remand, the District Court had reinstated the conviction and Mr. Patterson
appealed again. Again the Maine Supreme Judicial Court vacated. Id. In Patterson II , the Law
Court noted that in the context of a section 105 defense, “[b]ecause recklessness is the minimum
required mens rea requirement for assault pursuant to 17-A M.R.S. § 207(1)(A), the State was
required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Patterson‟s beliefs that led to his actions „when
viewed in light of the nature and purpose of [his] conduct and the circumstances known to [him],
[were] grossly deviant from what a reasonable and prudent person would believe in the same
situation.‟” Patterson II, 2005 ME 55, ¶ 8, 881 A.2d at 651 (quoting 17-A M.R.S. § 105).

                                                  5
Reply at 1 (clarifying that his challenge to using a § 207 conviction as a predicate

misdemeanor to a § 922(g)(9) charge was based not only on the mens rea issue, but

also the contention that “offensive contact” does not necessarily amount to “physical

force”). This Court has previously addressed these issues and no intervening case

law changes the outcome.

                       1.      The First Circuit’s Holding in Nason

       In United States v. Nason, the First Circuit rejected the same mens rea and

level of force arguments Mr. Bryant raises here. 269 F.3d 10 (2001). The Nason

Court considered whether conduct violating the “offensive physical contact” prong of

§ 207 “necessarily involves the use or attempted use of physical force” such that

convictions under that prong may qualify as predicate offenses under §922(g)(9). Id.

at 11-12.     It held that “all convictions under [17-A M.R.S. § 207] qualify as

misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence within the purview of 18 U.S.C. §

922(g)(9).” Id. at 21. The Nason Court explained that “Congress intended section

922(g)(9) to encompass crimes characterized by the application of any physical

force.” Id. at 18.

       Mr. Bryant argues that Nason “does not address the intent issue presented

by Congress‟s selection of the term „use of force.‟” Def.’s Mot. at 11. The Court

disagrees. In Nason, the First Circuit reviewed the decisions of the Maine Supreme

Judicial Court, which addressed “offensive physical contact” under § 207, and

concluded that the phrase involves “something less than bodily injury” but more

        Although Mr. Bryant‟s point is well taken about the minimal nature of the offensive physical
contact that may sustain an assault conviction, the Patterson cases also reflect that a conviction for
minimal offensive physical contact may be more difficult under Maine law than Mr. Bryant allowed.

                                                  6
than “mere touching.” Nason 269 F.3d at 19 (quoting State v. Pozzouli, A.2d 745

(Me. 1997)). The First Circuit cited § 207‟s “mens rea requirement” as one of the

distinctions between offensive physical contact and mere touching. Id. In other

words, the Nason Court considered § 207‟s mens rea requirement as a factor

harmonizing its elements with the definition of misdemeanor crime of domestic

violence. Moreover, although Mr. Bryant emphasizes the word “use” preceding the

phrase “physical force,” suggesting it supplies an intentionality element to the

definition of misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, see Def.’s Mot. at 9, the Nason

Court found that “offensive physical contacts with another person‟s body

categorically involve the use of physical force.” 269 F.3d at 20. Because knowing

and reckless are expressly sufficient mentes reae for offensive physical contact

under § 207, the First Circuit implicitly rejected the idea that intentionality is an

essential element of “use of physical force.”

      Finally, Mr. Bryant cites no First Circuit case law for the assertion that

intentionality is a required element of misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence.

Although he points to the case law of other circuits, which have focused on the level

of force necessary to constitute “physical force,” see Def.’s Mot. at 9-11 (citing United

States v. Hays, 526 F.3d 674 (10th Cir. 2008) and United States v. Belless, 338 F.3d

1063 (9th Cir. 2003)), Mr. Bryant has not directed the Court to any circuit

discussion of intentionality. Id. In short, the Court remains bound by First Circuit

precedent and is unconvinced that the decisions of other circuits presage a change

in First Circuit law sufficient to “loosen the iron grip of stare decisis.” United States



                                           7
v. Reveron Martinez, 836 F.3d 684, 687 n.2 (1st Cir. 1988). In fact, in United States

v. Duval, 496 F.3d 64, 84-85 (1st Cir. 2007), addressing the meaning of “violent

felony” under the ACCA, a three-judge panel of the First Circuit itself observed that

“[u]ntil such time as we revisit Nason en banc, we are bound to apply its holding

that even „offensive contact‟ constitutes a violent felony under Maine‟s assault and

battery statute.” (internal citation omitted).

                     2.     Developments in the Law Since Nason

       Mr. Bryant argues that intervening case law has overruled Nason.                His

argument highlights the term “physical force”, which appears in the ACCA and in

the definition of misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.            The ACCA defines

“violent felony” as “any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one

year” that

       (i)    has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of
              physical force against the person of another; or
       (ii)   is a burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or
              otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk
              of physical injury to another.

18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B) (emphasis supplied).          As noted earlier, the statutory

definition of misdemeanor crime of domestic violence contains the same term: “an

offense that . . . has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force . . . .”

18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(33)(A) (emphasis supplied). Mr. Bryant says that the Court must

apply judicial interpretations of “physical force” under the ACCA to “physical force”

under the definition of misdemeanor crime of domestic violence and that when the




                                             8
same interpretation is applied, Mr. Bryant‟s state conviction cannot serve as a

predicate crime for a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9).

      Mr. Bryant‟s argument is premised on his assertion that in Johnson v. United

States, 130 S. Ct. 1265 (2010), the Supreme Court effectively overruled Nason. In

Johnson, the Court held that a defendant‟s prior battery conviction under Florida

law was not a “violent felony” under the ACCA. Id. at 1265. The Johnson Court

stated that, “in the context of a statutory definition of „violent felony,‟ the phrase

„physical force‟ means violent force—that is, force capable of causing physical pain

or injury to another person.” Id. at 1272 (citing Flores v. Ashcroft, 350 F.3d 666, 672

(7th Cir. 2003)). The Johnson Court held that such force was not a prerequisite for

conviction under Florida‟s battery statute, which could be “satisfied by any

intentional physical contact, „no matter how slight.‟”     Id. at 1269-1270 (quoting

State v. Hearns 961 So. 2d 211, 218 (Fla. 2007)).

      For support, Mr. Bryant points to some stray judicial comments anticipating

that in interpreting the meaning of “violent felony” in the ACCA, the Supreme

Court might illuminate the meaning of “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.”

See Def.’s Mot. at 9-13; see also Duval, 496 F.3d at 85 (incorporating the First

Circuit‟s reasoning in Nason to its review of a district court‟s determination “that a

conviction in Maine for simple assault constitutes a crime of violence for the

purposes of the ACCA”); United States v. Pettengill, 682 F. Supp. 2d 49, 57-58 (D.

Me. 2010) (addressing defendant‟s request that the motion be held in abeyance

pending the disposition of Johnson, the Court noted that “there is no guarantee that



                                          9
when the Supreme Court issues its opinion in Johnson, it will resolve the issues

before the Court”); United States v. Wyman, 667 F. Supp. 2d 151, 154 n.4 (D. Me.

2009) (“Though not precisely the same question presented here or in Booker, the

Supreme Court‟s decision in Johnson could inform the First Circuit‟s position in

Nason”). More specifically, Mr. Bryant argues that Duval established that “the

ACCA must be read in the same manner as § 922(g)(9).” Def’.s Mot. at 13.

      The Court disagrees. In Duval, the First Circuit reviewed a district court‟s

determination that a defendant‟s conviction under § 207 constituted a violent crime

for purposes of the ACCA. 496 F.3d at 84-85. The Duval Court explained that it

reviewed the district court‟s determination for “plain error.” Under that standard,

it was the defendant‟s burden to show “(1) that an error occurred (2) which was

clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant‟s substantial rights,

but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial

proceedings.” Id. (citing United States v. Bennett, 469 F.3d 46, 51 (1st Cir. 2006)).

Noting that Nason was the only case cited by either party for guidance on the

interpretation of § 207, the Duval Court stated that it could not “distinguish it in

any meaningful way from the circumstances of [the defendant]‟s case,” and

concluded that it was “bound to apply its holding that even „offensive contact‟

constituted a violent felony under Maine‟s assault and battery statute.” Id. at 85.

Moreover, the Duval Court concluded that Nason was still binding law in the First

Circuit. Id. The Court does not read Duval, as Mr. Bryant suggests, as mandating

a wholesale importation of its construction of the ACCA into the definition of



                                           10
“misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.” Rather, the Duval Court‟s decision was

grounded on the twin doctrines of plain error and stare decisis. Id. at 84-85.

      Nor would Mr. Bryant‟s argument find support in Johnson. The Johnson

Court‟s construction of “physical force” in the ACCA context is narrower than the

First Circuit‟s construction of “physical force” in the § 921(a)(33)(A) context, which

includes “any physical force, regardless of whether that force resulted in bodily

injury or risk of harm.” Nason, 269 F.3d at 16-17. In Johnson, the Supreme Court

strongly indicated that the respective statutes harbor distinct meanings of “physical

force.” The Johnson Court emphasized that its holding was limited to the definition

of “physical force” in the context of the ACCA. 130 S. Ct. at 1271-1273. It expressly

stated that “[w]e do not decide that the phrase has the same meaning in the context

of defining a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. The issue is not before us, so

we do not decide it.” Id. at 1273. The Supreme Court, therefore, expressly declined

to endorse Mr. Bryant‟s view that the phrase “physical force” has the same meaning

in both contexts.

      Moreover, the Johnson Court‟s emphasis of the word “misdemeanor”

highlights the distinction between two separate statutory meanings of physical

force: (1) physical force as an element of a violent felony and (2) physical force as an

element of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.          The two meanings are

elements of distinct categories of crimes assigned separate levels of criminality. It

stands to reason that the degree of force Congress deemed necessary to constitute




                                          11
an element of a violent felony is greater than that necessary to constitute a

misdemeanor.

      To the extent Johnson addressed the question, the Supreme Court suggested

that the same phrase in the two statutes could have different meanings.           The

Johnson Court elaborated on the variant meanings of “physical force.” It noted that

an element of the common law crime of battery was “the intentional application of

unlawful force against the person of another.” Id. at 1270. The element could be

“satisfied by even the slightest offensive touching.”     Id.   The Supreme Court

determined that the common law definition did not fit the ACCA context where the

term “force” was accompanied by the modifiers “physical” and “violent.” Id. at 1271.

The Supreme Court also attributed significance to the term “felony” in the ACCA

meaning. Id. It observed that “even today a simple battery—whether of the mere-

touching or bodily-injury variety—generally is punishable as a misdemeanor,” and

concluded that “[i]t is unlikely that Congress would select as a term of art defining

„violent felony‟ a phrase that the common law gave peculiar meaning only in its

definition of misdemeanor.” Id. 1271-72. That “physical force” “normally connotes

force strong enough to constitute „power‟” is “all the more so when it is contained in

a definition of „violent felony.‟” Id. This reasoning indicates the Supreme Court‟s

recognition that Congress assigns the term “force” different meaning in the felony

context than in the misdemeanor context.

      For the same reason, the First Circuit‟s holding in United States v. Holloway,

630 F.3d 252 (1st Cir. 2011), does not disturb its holding in Nason. In Holloway,



                                         12
the First Circuit considered “whether a federal court may conclude that a conviction

under Massachusetts‟s simple assault and battery statute qualifies as a violent

felony under the ACCA.”       Id. at 254.   It is true, as Mr. Bryant contends, that

following Johnson, the First Circuit overruled United States v. Mangos, 134 F.3d

460 (1st Cir. 1998), which had held that “did assault and beat” charging language

“suffices to identify the harmful brand of battery for purposes of sentencing under

either the ACCA or the career offender provision of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines.”

Holloway, 630 F.3d at 257. The Holloway Court concluded that in view of Johnson

and Massachusetts state interpretations of the scope of the assault and battery

statute, “a sentencing court may not rely on the generic „did assault and beat‟

charging language to identify which particular battery offense served as the offense

of conviction.” Id. at 260.

      Holloway is no more than the First Circuit‟s declared allegiance to the

Supreme Court‟s directive in Johnson.        As the Government correctly observes,

“[t]here was simply no discussion of § 922(g)(9) or any attempt to define

misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.” Id. After Johnson, the Court will not

incorporate the construction of “physical force” under the definition of “violent

felony” in the ACCA to its analysis of “physical force” under the definition of
