you may have a                 tter       understanding              of   who I      am.


           My name            s CARLOS E.             SILVA GALINDO, I               was released               from
prison     in     2 0 0 4 , eversince            I    genuinely             have    tried         to    change
my Iife      in    the        e-introduction              to    society.


           This     cou t          is    in   a unique position                to evaluate              through
judgment, all             o    these letter's              from empLoyer's, churches, youths
director's         of r creation.                friends        of    the     communi              and famil

have    formed      a         cial       bond to improve my stay                     in society.


           There        is    know question              that    my family           is     the strength
that    has carri              me through to this                    point,        even though'I               have made
many mistakes t                cause them               and myself a lot              of suffering.
My wife      has he            her vow of             marri-age and for              that        I will        be
for    ever gratef            t.     Eversince I came home, I've                           be come the father,
mentor husband                nd friend          that     God intended              for     me.


           There        i-s not         a day    that     has gone bye              that     I    have    not
refl-ected        and r        retted         the mistakes            I     have made.
