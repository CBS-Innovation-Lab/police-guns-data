                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
                       DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE


United States of America

             v.                              Case No. 07-cr-115-01-SM

Daniel Carl Hicks

                                    ORDER

      The government’s motion to continue the final pretrial conference and trial

is granted (document 14). Trial has been rescheduled for the August 2008 trial

period.

      The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting a continuance

outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, 18

U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8)(B)(iv), in that failure to grant a continuance would

unreasonably deny defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective

preparation taking into account the exercise of due diligence under the

circumstances.

      Final Pretrial Conference: July 25, 2008 at 3:30 p.m.

      Jury Selection: August 5, 2008 at 9:30 a.m.

             SO ORDERED.
