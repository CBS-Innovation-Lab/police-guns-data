ORDER DENYING PETITIONER’S MOTION FOR REDUCTION OF SENTENCE

Keith Ware has filed a motion for sentence reduction pursuant
to 18 U.S.C. §3582(c)(2) and U.S.S.G. Amendment 599. A review of
the record indicates that the defendant is ineligible for a
reduction in sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §3582(c) because his
sentence was based. on his classification. as an armed career
criminal and his guideline range has not been changed by the
amendment to the guidelines. For that reason, and for the reasons

stated in the government’s memorandum, the motion is denied.
