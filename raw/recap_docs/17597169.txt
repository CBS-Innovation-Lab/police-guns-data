               ORDER AFFIRMING THE
    RECOMMENDED DECISION OF THE MAGISTRATE JUDGE


      The United States Magistrate Judge filed with the Court on July 27,

2011 her Recommended Decision (Docket # 30).      The Defendant filed his

objections to the Recommended Decision on August 29, 2011 (Docket # 34)

and the Government filed its response to those objections on September 9,

2011 (Docket # 36). I have reviewed and considered the Magistrate Judge's

Recommended Decision, together with the entire record; I have made a de

novo determination of all matters adjudicated by the Magistrate Judge's

Recommended Decision; and I concur with the recommendations of the

United States Magistrate Judge for the reasons set forth in her

Recommended Decision, and determine that no further proceeding is

necessary.

      1.     It is therefore ORDERED that the Recommended Decision of the
             Magistrate Judge is hereby AFFIRMED.

      2.     It is further ORDERED that the Defendantâ€™s Motion to Suppress
             (Docket # 15) be and hereby is DENIED.
      SO ORDERED.
